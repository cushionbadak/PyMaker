<p>One can use the classic loop</p>
<pre><code>file_in = open('suppliers.txt', 'r')
line = file_in.readline()

while line:
    line = file_in.readline()
</code></pre>
<p>to read through a file line-by-line in Python.</p>
<p>But what value does 'line' have when the loop exits?  The Python 3 docs only read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>readline(size=-1)</strong></p>
<p>Read and return one line from the stream. If size is specified, at
  most size bytes will be read.</p>
<p>The line terminator is always b'\n' for binary files; for text files,
  the newline argument to open() can be used to select the line
  terminator(s) recognized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>
<p>In my version of Python (3.6.1), if you open a file in binary mode, <code>help(file_in.readline)</code> gives</p>
<pre><code>readline(size=-1, /) method of _io.BufferedReader instance

    Read and return a line from the stream.

    If size is specified, at most size bytes will be read.

    The line terminator is always b'\n' for binary files; for text
    files, the newlines argument to open can be used to select the line
    terminator(s) recognized.
</code></pre>
<p>which is exactly the same as the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.readline" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs quoted above</a>. But, as noted by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45019414/1048186">Steve Barnes</a>, if you open the file in text mode, you get a useful comment. (Oops! Copy-paste error on my part)</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>f.readline()</code> reads a single line from the file; a newline character
  (<code>\n</code>) is left at the end of the string, and is only omitted on the
  last line of the file if the file doesnâ€™t end in a newline. This makes
  the return value unambiguous; if <code>f.readline()</code> returns an empty
  string, the end of the file has been reached, while a blank line is
  represented by <code>'\n'</code>, a string containing only a single newline.</p>

<p>In a python console opening a file, <em>f</em>, and then calling help on its readline method tells you exactly:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; f = open('temp.txt', 'w')
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(f.readline)
Help on built-in function readline:

readline(size=-1, /) method of _io.TextIOWrapper instance
    Read until newline or EOF.

    Returns an empty string if EOF is hit immediately.
</code></pre>
<p>Each readline operates on the remainder of the file from the current point onward so will eventually hit an EOF.</p>
<p>Note that if you open the file in binary mode, with <code>rb</code> rather than <code>r</code>, then rather than a <code>&lt;class '_io.TextIOWrapper'&gt;</code> object you will get a <code>&lt;class '_io.BufferedReader'&gt;</code> object - then the help message is different:</p>
<pre><code>Help on built-in function readline:

readline(size=-1, /) method of _io.BufferedReader instance
    Read and return a line from the stream.

    If size is specified, at most size bytes will be read.

    The line terminator is always b'\n' for binary files; for text
    files, the newlines argument to open can be used to select the line
    terminator(s) recognized.
</code></pre>
<p>And when this method reaches the EOF it will return an empty byte array, <code>b''</code> rather than an empty string.</p>
<p>Note that all the above was tested with python 3.6 on Win10.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Running the code snippet from the question in a (Python 3) console shows that it returns an empty string, or an empty Bytes object if opening the file in binary mode.</p>
<p>Is this documented somewhere? Perhaps it is sort of a broad python standard?</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The docs for this used to be a lot easier to understand.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>TextIOBase</code> documents that <code>readline</code> returns an empty string on EOF; the above excerpt is from the description in <code>IOBase</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">See my edit -- Python's docs for 3.6.1 no longer works this way.</span>
