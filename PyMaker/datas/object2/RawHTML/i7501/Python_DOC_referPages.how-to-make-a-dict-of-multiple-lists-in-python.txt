<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to make a list of dicts that have the following structure,</p>
<pre><code>[{'Business' : 'Attorney' , 'Website text' : '(one line from the loaded file)'}, {'Business' : 'Attorney' , 'Website text' : '(one line from the loaded file)'}, ...]
</code></pre>
<p>However at the moment i only have a csv file consisting of the website text. </p>
<p>Below i have attempted to somehow create lists of the same length as my website text file, then zip them and create a dict from that. I have been unable to find information on here when it comes to creating a dict from more that 2 lists. </p>
<pre><code>with open('attorneys text.csv') as data_file:
    attorneys = list(line for line in data_file)

website = []
business = []
classes = []
for l in range(len(attorneys)):
    website.append("Website text")

for k in range(len(attorneys)):
    business.append("Business")

for i in range(len(attorneys)):
    classes.append("Attorney")

data = dict(zip((business, classes, website, attorneys)))
</code></pre>
<p>I am well aware of the ugliness of the try as well...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since the only difference is the text, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><code>with open('attorneys text.csv') as data_file:
    data = [{'Business':'Attorney', 'Website text':line} for line in data_file]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>'Business':'Attorney'</code> pair will be the same for each dictionary, while the value corresponding to <code>'Website text'</code> will be the data from your file.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict:" rel="nofollow noreferrer">defaultdict</a></p>
<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict
s = ["Business", "Attorney", "Website text"]
data = defaultdict(list)

data[s[0]].append(business)
data[s[1]].append(classes)
data[s[2]].append(website)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is what i would do:</p>
<pre><code>data = []

with open('attorneys text.csv') as data_file:
  for line in data_file
    row = { "Business": "Attorney", "Website text": line}
    data.append(row)
</code></pre>
<p>I don t know if i understood well what you want to do</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you should share a small example of csv input file and expected output. I see a lot of room for improvement, but that looks more like a question for codereview...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jean-Fran√ßoisFabre The input of the csv file is just a string per line as described, and the output wanted is the one presented first in the question. Do you mean a more specific example?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It worked, and i accepted. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not quite sure how this solves it?</span>
