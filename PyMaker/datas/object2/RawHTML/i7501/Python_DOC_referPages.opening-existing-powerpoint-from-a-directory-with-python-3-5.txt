<p>Open an existing PowerPoint Presentation from a directory
Example from here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32639900/charts-from-excel-to-powerpoint-with-python">Charts from Excel to PowerPoint with Python</a></p>
<p>My situation is different - the link showed how to to open a new presentation not a saved existing one.</p>
<p>error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>module None. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can call out to the <code>open</code> cmd and pass the filename to be opened as the only parameter. It will query the registry to find the program that should be used as default to open such a file, how to do it, and then do it.</p>
<p>This should work, did not check though</p>
<pre><code>subprocess.run(['open', 'the file to be opened.pptx'])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I recommend you update with your OS and platform details.  Doing this on Linux would be very different than Windows</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am using windows.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am opening it to add excel charts and graphs and text and tables to it. I don't know if the language you are using will help with doing that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was under the impression that by "opening" you mean "present to the user".  <a href="http://www.s-anand.net/blog/automating-powerpoint-with-python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here</a> is an example of how to use win32com to open an existing pptx and modify it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok - but how do you open it from a saved directory.  I saw that link before and I was trying to figure out this argument Presentation = Application.Presentations.Open(sys.argv[1]) and how to put the path and filename there ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>sys.argv[1]</code> refers to the first argument given to the script while executing; that is <code>python foobar.py openme.pptx</code> would open <code>openme.pptx</code>. Replace the parameter to <code>Open()</code> with a string or a variable holding your filename</span>
<span class="comment-copy">actually I did that and couldn't open it. I think maybe I need to install python-pptx ?  The error I got is pywintypes.com_error:  (-2147352567, 'Exception occurred.', (0, None, None, None, 0, -2147024773), None)</span>
