<p>I'm following the tutorial on django on the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial02/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial02/</a></p>
<p>Specifically the part where its adding the <strong>str</strong> methods on both classes, but I'm getting the indent error!</p>
<p>I used python before and after looking for a while I still can't see my error!</p>
<p>See the image with the hidden characters of my code, what is it!? It's been driving me crazy:</p>

<p>See the error when trying to run the python shell:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZEby.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="Error on shell" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MZEby.png"/></a></p>
<p>So what could it be? I am legit running out of ideas.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Indentation is rejected as inconsistent if a source file mixes tabs and spaces in a way that makes the meaning dependent on the worth of a tab in spaces; a TabError is raised in that case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>if you are consistent in your use of tabs and spaces this problem will go away.</p>
