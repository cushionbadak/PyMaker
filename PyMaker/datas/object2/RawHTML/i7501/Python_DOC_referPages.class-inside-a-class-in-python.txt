<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>How can i call a class inside a class in Python? For example:</p>
<pre><code>class POINT:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

class CIRCLE:
    def __init__(self, x, y, radius):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.radius = radius
</code></pre>
<p>I want to call POINT class in CIRCLE.
Thanks for answers.</p>

<p>Are you trying to do this?</p>
<pre><code>class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, point, radius):
        self.point = point
        self.radius = radius

c = Circle(Point(2,3), 5)
</code></pre>
<p>That way, you'll have a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">class</a> <code>Circle</code> which in its constructor accepts a point (an instance of class <code>Point</code>) and a radius, producing and instance of <code>Circle</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do you want to define the circle's center position using the POINT class? If this is what you want, you throw away the self.x/self.y inside CIRCLE and do <code>self.center = POINT(x,y)</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried doing? Also you don't "call" a class</span>
<span class="comment-copy">are you trying to make circle inherit from point ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ummm, <code>class CIRCLE(POINT): ...</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you illustrate (even if it is wrong syntactically) what are you trying to do? <i>"I want to call POINT class in CIRCLE"</i> does not describe what you are trying to achieve in a language that is understandable to anyone with some knowledge in programming.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think what he's saying is he wants to make an instance of class point in class circle</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i wanted to do this.</span>
