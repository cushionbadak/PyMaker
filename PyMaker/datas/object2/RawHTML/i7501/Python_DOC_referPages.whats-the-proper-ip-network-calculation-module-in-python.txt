<p>Since "The Zen of Python" tells us "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it." I would like to ask what is the best upstream module to use for IP and/or network calculations?</p>
<p>I found the following:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ipcalc</strong> - which seems to be maintained no more (bug issues open for &gt;2 years)</li>
<li><strong>netaddr</strong> - which seems to do exactly what I want and has a great documentation (I'm using this one at the moment)</li>
<li><strong>ipaddress</strong> - which seems to have more or less the same functionality as netaddr (but with a more clumsy interface, telling from documentation)</li>
<li><strong>ipaddr</strong> - which may be something like that telling from the few words on the github repo (can't seem to find a real documentation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe there are even more?
I would really like to know what the community thinks is the best way to go.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>May not be the best, but <strong>ipaddress</strong> is part of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Python Standard Library</a>, so it would be definitely my first choice.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I actually asked for the "most common" way, not necessarily the best. So this is exactly the answer I wanted to hear. Thanks. :)</span>
