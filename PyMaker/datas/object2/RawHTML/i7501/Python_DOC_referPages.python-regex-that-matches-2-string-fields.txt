<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to create a RegEx that will help me with my process. I have to see if 2 fields that contain text match or not, e.g </p>
<pre><code>fA="John Cohen" and fB="Jackie Cohen SRL"
</code></pre>
<p>First: I want to see how many words there are ==&gt; 2 in fA and 3 in fB. Sometimes fA or fB have only 1 word and I need to see if fA = fB</p>
<p>Second: I need to see if fA is included in fB or if is the same, and what is different?</p>
<p>Please let me know if you need more info.</p>

<p>Regex won't be the right tool for what you want.</p>
<p>You can start by splitting your strings (which gives you lists of words), and making <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sets</a> from them.</p>
<p>Then, you can easily and quickly get the common elements, differences and so on, see the documentation for all possible operations.</p>
<p>Some of the things you want could be accomplished this way:</p>
<pre><code>fA="John Cohen" 
fB="Jackie Cohen SRL"

set_A = set(fA.split())
# {'Cohen', 'John'}
set_B = set(fB.split())
# {'Cohen', 'Jackie', 'SRL'}

if len(set_A) == 1 and set_A == set_B:
    print("Both strings are {}".format(fA))

# set_A included in (or equal to) set_B?
if set_A &lt;= set_B:
    print("{} included in {}".format(set_A, set_B))

# common elements
print(set_A &amp; set_B)
# {'Cohen'}

# in set_B but not in set_A
print(set_B - set_A)
# {'SRL', 'Jackie'}

# in set_A or set_B, but not in both
print(set_A ^ set_B)
# {'John', 'SRL', 'Jackie'}
</code></pre>
<p>You could print the elements of a set like this:</p>
<pre><code>print('/'.join(set_A ^ set_B))
# John/SRL/Jackie
</code></pre>
<p>but note that the order will be random, as sets are not ordered.
You could also turn the sets into lists with <code>list(set_A)</code> and sort them if you need. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Regex is not the right tool for what you want to accomplish. What have you tried until now, and what problems did you encounter?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, I am new to Python. Did RegEx in VBA, not in Python. Therefore i need help, as is a new language for me. Currently working with Selenium, Django and Bootstrap. They are not the right module to do that....thanks for your answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thierry, you really rock! thank you! Is this normal python code, or i have to install some other modules like re etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nothing to import, sets are a standard data structure.</span>
