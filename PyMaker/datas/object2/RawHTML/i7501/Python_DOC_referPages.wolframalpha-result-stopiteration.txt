<p>I've just run your code (with the question "temperature of the sun") and it seems to work fine, giving me an answer of 5772 K.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration" rel="nofollow noreferrer">StopIteration</a> is raised when there are no more items in the iterable (res.results). What question did you ask, and are you sure it gave an answer?</p>
<p>Try printing <code>res.results</code> before the call to <code>next</code> to check what it returned.</p>
