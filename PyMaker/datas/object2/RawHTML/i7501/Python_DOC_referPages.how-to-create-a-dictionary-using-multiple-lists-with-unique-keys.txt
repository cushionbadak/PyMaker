<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to add key, value to an existing dictionary from a pre-defined list. Below is an example:</p>
<pre><code># I created players dictionary : 
players = {'gyms_visited': [],
 'player_id': [4],
 'player_name': 'cynthia',
 'player_pokemon': {},
 'time_played': 30.9}
</code></pre>
<p>I'm trying to add the list <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> to my players dictionary that I created above:</p>
<pre><code>a = ['player_id', 'player_name','time_played', 'player_pokemon', 'gyms_visited']
b = [2, 'teri', 22.2, {}, []]
</code></pre>
<p>Also, is there a way to make <code>Player_id</code>'s value (4, 2) as keys to the players dictionary ( This is what I'm trying to achieve):</p>
<pre><code>{4: {'gyms_visited': [],
     'player_name': 'cynthia',
     'player_pokemon': {},
     'time_played': 30.9},
 2: {'player_name':'teri',
     'time_played':22.2,
     'gyms_visited': [],
     'player_pokemon':{}}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>All you need is:</p>
<pre><code># to change already existing dict
players = {players['player_id']:{key:value for key,value in players.items() if key != 'player_id'}}
# make dict from lists a and b
z = {b[a=='player_id']: {key:value for key,value in zip(a,b) if key !='player_id'}}
# group both
players={**players,**z}
</code></pre>
<p>Details Below:</p>
<p>First you will need to change your already made dict to the desired output type like this:</p>
<pre><code>players = {players['player_id']:{key:value for key,value in players.items() if key != 'player_id'}}
print(players)
</code></pre>
<p>will output:</p>
<pre><code>{4: {'gyms_visited': [], 
    'player_name': 'cynthia', 
    'player_pokemon': {}, 
    'time_played': 30.9}}
</code></pre>
<p>then you take your two lists <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and make an additional dict out of them like this:</p>
<pre><code>z = {b[a=='player_id']: {key:value for key,value in zip(a,b) if key !='player_id'}}
print(z)
</code></pre>
<p>will output:</p>
<pre><code>{2: {'player_name':
    'teri', 'time_played': 22.2, 
    'player_pokemon': {}, 
    'gyms_visited': []}}
</code></pre>
<p>and Finally, you just put them in the same dict as follows:</p>
<pre><code>players={**players,**z}
print(players)
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>{4: {'gyms_visited': [],
    'player_name': 'cynthia',
    'player_pokemon': {},
    'time_played': 30.9},
 2: {'player_name': 'teri',
    'time_played': 22.2, 
    'player_pokemon': {},
    'gyms_visited': []}}
</code></pre>
<p>Please notice that you can do this in a loop if you want to add some more membres. For exemple consider these new lists:</p>
<pre><code>a = ['player_id', 'player_name','time_played', 'player_pokemon', 'gyms_visited']
b = [6, 'new_Name', 66.6, {}, []]
</code></pre>
<p>by doing the same as before:</p>
<pre><code>z = {b[a=='player_id']: {key:value for key,value in zip(a,b) if key !='player_id'}}
players={**players,**z}
</code></pre>
<p>you get as output:</p>
<pre><code>{4: {'gyms_visited': [], 
    'player_name': 'cynthia', 
    'player_pokemon': {}, 
    'time_played': 30.9}, 
 2: {'player_name': 'teri', 
    'time_played': 22.2, 
    'player_pokemon': {}, 
    'gyms_visited': []}, 
 6: {'player_name': 'new_Name', 
     'time_played': 66.6, 
     'player_pokemon': {}, 
     'gyms_visited': []}}

<p>Note: Whenever you're working with some iteration code, it's worth checking out the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itertools package</a>. <code>izip</code>, for eaxample, improves over <code>zip</code> by returning an iterator instead of a list.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you clarify your need? it's a bit unclear</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i have an existing dictionary called players , which has variables assigned {'gyms_visited': [],  'player_id': [4],  'player_name': 'cynthia',  'player_pokemon': {},  'time_played': 30.9}</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i m trying to add another dictionary from the list[a],[b]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">your first player cynthia, is it already in a dictionary ? or did you at some point have her in a list ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so basically creating a dictionary within a dictionary :</span>
