<p>I have a Python script and I want too run it at 3 am. Would like to simply put something like this at the top of it.</p>
<pre><code>while not 3am:
    sleep(10)
</code></pre>
<p>That way it keeps sleeping for 10 seconds until it's 3am. At 3am, it executes the rest of the code below this and then exits the script.  Is there a simple way to do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Solution with a sleep-wait loop:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
import time

target_time = datetime.datetime(2017, 3, 7, 3)  # 3 am on 3 July 2017
while datetime.datetime.now() &lt; target_time:
    time.sleep(10)
print('It is 3am, now running the rest of the code')
</code></pre>
<p>If instead of sleeping, you want to do other work, consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#timer-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">threading.Timer</a> or the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#sched.scheduler" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>sched</em> module</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">No, this would not be correct. You would want to use a ready-to-use service provided by your OS. Either crontab on a *nix environment or Windows Scheduler on a Windows environment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is pretty much exactly what I want but I think there is minor error.  Shouldn't it be:  datetime.datetime(2017, 7, 3, 3) to go at 3 am tomorrow morning?</span>
