<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What I mean is, let's say I have the date '2018-05-20'. I want it in the form of 'May 20th, 2018'. What is the best way to do this without brute-forcing (below, for example) so that you don't have to create a bunch of dictionary entries and then deal with mapping all the numbers for months and dates to their English representation? </p>
<pre><code>monthDict = {}
monthDict['01'] = 'January'
monthDict['02'] = 'February'
monthDict['03'] = 'March'
monthDict['04'] = 'April'
monthDict['05'] = 'May'
monthDict['06'] = 'June'
monthDict['07'] = 'July'
monthDict['08'] = 'August'
monthDict['09'] = 'September'
monthDict['10'] = 'October'
monthDict['11'] = 'November'
monthDict['12'] = 'December'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to parse it in the existing format, and output the new.  There is an output <code>%B</code> that represents the full month.  Example:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
s = '2018-05-20'
dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(s, '%Y-%m-%d')
print dt.strftime('%B %d, %Y')
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>$ python test.py 
May 20, 2018
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You should look into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer">strftime() and strptime()</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.month_name" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>calendar.month_name</code></a> instead of defining your own. It's an array indexed by integers, not a <code>dict</code> with keys that are strings, however.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">np!  not sure why people are downvoting your question - it's basic but legit.  that sucks, sorry.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FinnaBoi I thought it was meant to be <code>May 20th, 2018</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is no strftime option for the ordinal of the date (th/st/nd).  You'll have to write your own function for that, but you won't have to brute force it.

<span class="comment-copy">@keredson Appreciate the link. And yeah I'm just starting out with Python, so extra thanks to people who have your patience!</span>
