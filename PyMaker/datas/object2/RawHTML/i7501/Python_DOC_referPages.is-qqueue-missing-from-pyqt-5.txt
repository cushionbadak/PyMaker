<p>I'm stumbling over a strange issue: is it possible that the QQueue class from Qt5 (<a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qqueue.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qqueue.html</a>) is not present in PyQt? I couldn't import it and then realized it isn't in this list of PyQt5 classes: <a href="http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/</a></p>
<p>Is this true? If so, is there a reason? and an alternative short of implementing my own class</p>

<p>It is obviously not possible for PyQt/PySide to support template classes, since they depend on a feature that is specific to C++.</p>
<p>In general, you should just use the equivalent built-in python type instead (or, where applicable, whatever implementation is currently available in the standard library - e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#queue-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">queue.Queue</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque" rel="nofollow noreferrer">collections.deque</a>).</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Regarding <code>QProcess.errorOccurred</code> - this signal <strong>is</strong> available in PyQt-5.8.2, and has been since at least PyQt-5.3.2 (which is the oldest version I can check). The <code>QProcess.error</code> signal is <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qprocess-obsolete.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">obsolete</a>, and should not be used in new code.</p>
<p>PPS:</p>
<p>PyQt5 is certainly not "still in development" (but <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/PySide2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PySide for Qt5</a> is).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. I think it would have been helpful if the class wouldn't simply be missing from the PyQt docs but somehow been indicated as unavailable. (PPS: This was not <i>my</i> assumption ;-) )</span>
