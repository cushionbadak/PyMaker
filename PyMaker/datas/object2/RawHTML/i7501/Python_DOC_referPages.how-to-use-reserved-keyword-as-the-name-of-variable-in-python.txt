<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to use reserved keyword "from" as the name of variable.</p>
<p>I have it in my arguments parser:</p>
<pre><code>parser.add_argument("--from")
args = parser.parse_args()
print(args.from)
</code></pre>
<p>but this isn't working because "from" is reserved. It is important to have this variable name, I don't want answers like "from_".</p>
<p>Is there any option? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>getattr()</code> to access the attribute:</p>
<pre><code>print(getattr(args, 'from'))
</code></pre>
<p>However, in <code>argparse</code> you can have the command-line option <code>--from</code> <em>without</em> having to have the <em>attribute</em> <code>from</code> by using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#dest" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dest</code> option</a> to specify an alternative name to use:</p>
<pre><code>parser.add_argument('--from', dest='from_')

# ...
args = parser.parse_args()
print(args.from_)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You may want to explain <b>why</b> you think it is important to have that variable name. Your code won't execute any different if the variable was named <code>from_</code>, but you'd have an easier time of reading your code without the work-arounds that requires.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><b>Disclaimer:</b> I am <b>not</b> encouraging the following method, I'm just pointing out the possibilities. In your situation I would definitely go with using <code>from_</code> as the variable name. Similar to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9108164/3767239">this answers</a> you can modify the Python source (the source code of the compiler) in order to change the reserved keyword <code>from</code> to something else (for example <code>from_</code>). Then you can rebuild the source in order to obtain your custom Python compiler with which you can use <code>from</code> as a variable name. Please note that this is a horrible idea for many reasons.</span>
