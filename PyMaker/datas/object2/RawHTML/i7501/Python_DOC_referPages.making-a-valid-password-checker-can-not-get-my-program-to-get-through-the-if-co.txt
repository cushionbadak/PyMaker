<p>I have been assigned the following exercise as homework:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>Some Web sites impose certain rules for passwords. Write a function that checks whether a string is a valid password. Suppose the password rules are as follows:
  
  <ul>
<li>A password must have at least eight characters.</li>
<li>A password must consist of only letters and digits.</li>
<li>A password must contain at least two digits.
  Write a program that prompts the user to enter a password and displays valid password if the rules are followed or invalid password otherwise.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I know there's a more efficient and proper way of doing this but i'm just starting out so I don't necessarily need to be those right now. Just want to finish this question. </p>
<p>The counter/ accumulator works and I don't get any errors but I can not fulfill the if condition correctly so that this program prints "valid password"</p>
<pre><code>password = str(input("Enter in a password to be checked: "))

def valid_password_checker(password):

    from string import ascii_lowercase as alphabet

    digits = '0123456789'  # creates a string of digits
    digit = 0  # acc for digits
    length = 0 # acc for length

    for char in password:  # calls on each character in string
        if char in alphabet:
            length += 1
        if char in digits:
            digit += 1
            if digit &gt;= 2:
                flag = True
                if length &gt;= 8 and digit is True:
                    print("valid password")
                else:
                    print("Password does not contain enough characters or digits.")
            else:
                print("Password does not contain enough digits.")

valid_password_checker(password)

</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem with your existing code is that the variable <code>digit</code> is a number, and therefore doing <code>digit is True</code> as you have done in your <code>if</code> statement, always return <code>False</code>. If you remove <code>digit is True</code>, then your existing solution will work. Take a look however at my version:</p>
<pre><code>def valid(password):
    digits = 0
    characters = 0

    for char in password:
        if char.isalpha():
            characters += 1
        elif char.isdigit():
            digits += 1
            characters += 1

    if characters &gt;= 8:
        if digits &gt;= 2:
            print("Password is valid")
        else:
            print("Password doesn't contain enough digits")
    else:
        print("Password doesn't contain enough characters")
</code></pre>
<p>I have made the following modifications from your original:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used the built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.isdigit()</code></a> for checking if a character is a digit.</li>
<li>Used the built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.isalpha()</code></a> for checking if a character is a letter of the alphabet</li>
<li>Moved everything but the counting operations outside of the <code>for</code> loop, so that the function doesn't print multiple things</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want, you can undo the first two changes, if you're worried about your teacher knowing you asked for help. However, I wouldn't turn in the solution that prints "Password doesn't contain enough digits" as many times as there are characters in the inputted password.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>password = str(input("What is the password that you want to validate: "))

def get_digits(password):
    return [i for i in password if i.isdigit()]


numbers = ''.join(get_digits(password))

if (len(password) &lt; 8) or (len(numbers) &lt; 2):
    print(password, "is an invalid password")
else:
    print(password, "is a valid password")
</code></pre>
<p>nice and simple.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You have assigned <code>digit</code> a numeric value. Therefore calling <code>digit is True</code> always returns <code>False</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to use regex for this purpose. If else are not very good for these kind of things</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! Yeah, I was gonna clean it up once I got a working solution. There's a lot I still am struggling with but slowly trying to make progress - this is a summer course so it's very accelerated and professor is never on campus for help since it is a summer course.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Buttmuncher Glad I could help. Be sure to mark the answer as "accepted" if it helped you, and good luck with your course. You've made the right choice beginning to learn code.</span>
