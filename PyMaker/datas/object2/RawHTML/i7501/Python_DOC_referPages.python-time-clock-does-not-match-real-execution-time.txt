<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am testing the execution time of a python script. 
The script begins with </p>
<pre><code>from time import clock
print clock()
</code></pre>
<p>and ends with</p>
<pre><code>print clock()
</code></pre>
<p>My script executes much longer than the time difference I get with this method. I want to know why this happens? Is the processor time counted in a different way than I think?</p>
<p>Thanks for advice!</p>

<p>If what you need is real execution time rather than CPU time, use <code>time.time</code> instead of <code>time.clock</code>; also, you might be interested in <code>timeit</code> module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What are the durations you measures, and what did the clock return ? (out of curiosity)</span>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>time.clock()</code> should be the time your program ran in the CPU, so as a simple example, let's say you're opening a file, the I/O latency won't be reported by <code>time.clock()</code>. Also this function is deprecated from 3.3, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.clock" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.clock</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! I was the 'time.clock() is used for benchmarking' in the docs that confused me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is a simple sql select from a sqlit3 db it takes about 10 seconds on an old pentium 4 processcor machine and time.clock() says it were 1.3 seconds.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For timing, the best to use is <code>timeit.default_timer()</code>. This should map to whatever time function provides best time precision, plus when possible use a timer that isn't affected by changes in system time. That is, will use a monotonic timer.</span>
