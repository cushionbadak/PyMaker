<p>I have no clue. It prints nothing. The array is empty. I've tried grabbing every null character and removing them in case it's UTF16 -&gt; open as UTF8, didn't work.</p>

<p>You are passing the incorrect second argument to the <code>open</code> call to read the file in this way:</p>
<pre><code>posshell_files = []
with open("posshell.log", "r") as posshell:
    for line in posshell:
        print(line)
        posshell_files.append(line)
</code></pre>
<p>According to the Python docs for <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>open</code></a>, <code>'r'</code> if the default flag for reading while <code>'a+'</code> is for reading and writing but you will have to do so in a different manner:</p>
<pre><code>with open("posshell.log","a+") as f:
    f.seek(0)
    print(f.read())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this</p>
<pre><code>with open('posshell.log') as p:
    content = p.readlines()
    content = [x.strip() for x in content] 
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">This worked but my understanding is that I was using one that should be a catch all. edit; thanks for the link</span>
