<p>I'm making a hangman game in python. I want to display the amount of characters in the word, but instead of it producing the integer as the amount of characters, I would like it instead to be '_'(one for every character.)</p>
<pre><code>word = input('Please enter a word for your opponent:')
print(len(word) as '_') #Instead of an integer
</code></pre>

<p>Basically what Kenny Ostrom has suggested in the comment above, just answering it here so this question can be marked complete:</p>
<p>Strings in Python can be repeated n times by using the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code>s = 'hello'
n = 3
p = s * n # p is equal to "hellohellohello"
</code></pre>
<p>So what you're looking for is:</p>
<pre><code>print(len(word) * '_')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In the most simpliest form, this is probably what you're looking for.</p>
<pre><code>print('_'*len('Foo'))
</code></pre>
<p>What's happening in this instance? Well breaking it down step by step looks like this</p>
<pre><code>'_'*len('Foo')   
'_'*3
'___'
</code></pre>
<p>There's some steps here, but the core concept is that some operators work on strings</p>
<p>You should take some time out of your day and learn about some operators and comparsions that can be used with strings. Here's the offical Documentation for python 3</p>

<p>If that's too much of an eyesore, youtube is great too.</p>

<p>It might look better as:</p>
<pre><code>' '.join('_' * 5) # '_ _ _ _ _'
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">That would be '_' * len(word)</span>
