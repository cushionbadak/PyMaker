<p>I am trying to use a simple event listener.</p>
<p>This is what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>import keyboard 
while True:
    if keyboard.is_pressed('p'):
        print('You pressed P')
</code></pre>
<p>I get the error: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>AttributeError: module 'keyboard' has no attribute 'is_pressed'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I check the <a href="https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard#keyboard.is_pressed" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>, I see that <code>is_pressed</code> exists.</p>
<p>Is there something wrong with the library or am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>I'll add it as a formal answer anyways. You mentioned that you <code>git clone</code> the repository. I guess this is confusing since the README says you can either do <code>pip install</code> or <code>git clone</code> to install the package.</p>
<p>When you do <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>import</code></a>, it tells Python to go through it's package manager to find the module and these need to be installed on your end. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pip</code></a> is the package management system that Python uses</p>
<p>If you want to install a package that you have as a local folder (i.e. if you wanted to test a local module) you can do so see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9059699/python-use-a-library-locally-instead-of-installing-it">here</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you made sure to properly install the keyboard module and such cause it seemed to work for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure you're importing the right module? Try <code>print(keyboard.__file__)</code> to see what you're importing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RezaSaadati I believe that's the problem -- try doing <code>sudo pip install keyboard</code> in command line as mentioned in their docs. Cloning the repository won't hook it into python's package manager. If you want it to work with your local repository, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9059699/python-use-a-library-locally-instead-of-installing-it">this</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead of downloading it from git, why not install it with pip? Run <code>pip install keyboard</code> in an admin terminal.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rawing thank you for this info! I used <code>py -m pip install keyboard</code> and it works like a charm!</span>
