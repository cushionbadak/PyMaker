<p>I have the last set of values of an iteration: <code>y1[i],y2[i],y3[i]</code>(which was obtained by doing the integration of coupled ODE)
Now I need to assign these values to another variables : Y1,Y2,Y3 and then use these variables in a function f(y,t) (ODEs that has to be integrated again).
This is part of my code:</p>
<pre><code>#constants used
H = 2.27e-18
l = 1.5
G = 6.637*(10**(-11))
k = (8*3.14*G)**0.5
om_de = 0.75
omega_matter = 1 - om_de
w0 = -0.85
rho_c = 3*(H**2)/(k**2)
c = ((om_de*(1 + w0)*rho_c)/(H**2))**0.5
v0 = (om_de*(1 - w0)*rho_c)/(2*np.exp(-l*k))

#for iteration
p = 0.0
q = 1.0
n = 10000.0

def H(Y1,Y2,Y3):
    return -3*Y3*(H**2)*(omega_matter/(Y1**3) + (H**2)*(Y3**2)/(2.0*rho_c) + (v0*np.exp(-l*Y2*k))/(rho_c))**0.5 + (l*k*v0*np.exp(-l*Y2*k))/(H**2)

dH = (q-p)/n
Y1 = [y1[j]]
Y2 = [y2[j]]
Y3 = [y3[j]]
But I am not able to do any further operations on them.

<p>keeps showing up.
The link to the complete code is here:
<a href="https://pastebin.com/mdQE29N9" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pastebin.com/mdQE29N9</a> (might help in understanding what I am trying to achieve and the code is too lengthy to be posted here)</p>
<p>I think the problem is with the way I have assigned the values,but am not so sure. Any help here as to what is causing this and how I am supposed to solve this would be great.</p>

<p>You have an error in line 57:</p>
<pre><code>def F(Y1,Y2,Y3):
    return Y1*(omega_matter/(Y1**3) + (H**2)*(Y3**2)/(2.0*rho_c) + (v0*np.exp(-l*Y2*k))/(rho_c))**(1.0/2.0)
</code></pre>
<p>in expression <code>H**2</code>, where <code>H</code> is defined as a function in line 62:</p>
<pre><code>def H(Y1,Y2,Y3):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>I'm guessing you really meant to say: <code>H(Y1,Y2,Y3)**2</code>.</p>
<p>But that's not all. Line 52:</p>
<pre><code>y1 == y1.append(y1[j] + (dh/6.0)*(k1 + 2.0*k2 + 2.0*k3 + k4))
</code></pre>
<p>No need to test for equivalence between <code>y1</code> and <code>None</code> (that's what <code>append()</code> returns). I'm not sure what you tried to achieve here, maybe this?</p>
<pre><code>y1.append(y1[-1] + (dh/6.0)*(k1 + 2.0*k2 + 2.0*k3 + k4))
</code></pre>
<p>Also, to access the last element of <code>y1</code> (line 66), you can use a negative index:</p>
<pre><code>Y1 = [y1[-1]]   # instead of: Y1 = [y1[j]]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have a variable named H and a function named H()</p>
<pre><code>H = 2.27e-18
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>def H(Y1,Y2,Y3):
    return -3*Y3*(H**2)*(omega_matter/(Y1**3) + (H**2)*(Y3**2)/(2.0*rho_c) + (v0*np.exp(-l*Y2*k))/(rho_c))**0.5 + (l*k*v0*np.exp(-l*Y2*k))/(H**2)
</code></pre>
<p>Change the name of the variable or the function for something else.</p>
<pre><code>H_1 = 2.27e-18 #for example
</code></pre>
<p>As @randomir says, you probably want to look at his answer too</p>
<p>You can reproduce the error by simple doing:</p>
<pre><code>H = 5

def H(a,b):
  pass

print(H**3)

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Catch the exceptio</a> and in the except suite print things that might be relevant to the problem like <code>Y1</code> or <code>[y2[j]]</code> or the <i>type</i> of those things.

<span class="comment-copy">@wwii I edited the question a little to be more readable, you are right, with just those data nobody was able to help, thanks for the comment</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you are right, I think you find the issue too, I will up vote it :)</span>
