<p>The folder I want to get to is called python and is on my desktop.</p>
<p>I get the following error when I try to get to it</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; os.chdir('C:\Users\expoperialed\Desktop\Python')
SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 2-3: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to use a <em>raw</em> string, double your slashes or use forward slashes instead:</p>
<pre><code>r'C:\Users\expoperialed\Desktop\Python'
'C:\\Users\\expoperialed\\Desktop\\Python'
'C:/Users/expoperialed/Desktop/Python'
</code></pre>
<p>In regular python strings, the <code>\U</code> character combination signals a extended Unicode codepoint escape.</p>
<p>You can hit any number of other issues, for any of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="noreferrer">recognised escape sequences</a>, such as <code>\a</code> or <code>t</code> or <code>\x</code>, etc.</p>

<p><code>C:\\Users\\expoperialed\\Desktop\\Python</code>
This syntax worked for me.</p>

<p>This usually happens in Python 3. One of the common reasons would be that while specifying your file path you need "\\" instead of "\". As in:</p>
<pre><code>filePath = "C:\\User\\Desktop\\myFile"
</code></pre>
<p>For Python 2, just using "\" would work.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>f = open('C:\\Users\\Pooja\\Desktop\\trolldata.csv')...
Use '\\' for python program in python version 3 and above..
Error will be resolved..</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>All the three syntax work very well.</p>
<p>Another way is to first write</p>
<p>path = r'C:\user\...................' (whatever is the path for you)</p>
<p>and then passing it to os.chdir(path)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use this </p>
<pre><code>os.chdir('C:/Users\expoperialed\Desktop\Python')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I had the same error.
Basically, I suspect that the path cannot start either with "U" or "User" after "C:\".
I changed my directory to "c:\file_name.png" by putting the file that I want to access from python right under the 'c:\' path.</p>
<p>In your case, if you have to access the "python" folder, perhaps reinstall the python, and change the installation path to something like "c:\python". Otherwise, just avoid the "...\User..." in your path, and put your project under C:.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@Dmitry your comment doesn't help anyone. Sorry the answer didn't help you solve your problem but how am I going to improve my post with that feedback?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look at my answer below.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dmitry: that's a different issue, and little to do with string literals. There are other posts on the site that handle the <code>raw_unicode_escape</code> codec. That a specific package has a bug that throws the same exception is not really an answer to this specific question, so I deleted it again (the community had already deleted it before). I suspect there are better ways of solving that specific bug (like not getting to the point where you have to use <code>raw_unicode_escape</code> in the first place).</span>
