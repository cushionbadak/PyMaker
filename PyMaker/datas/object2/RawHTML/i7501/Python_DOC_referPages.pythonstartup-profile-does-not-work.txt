<p>Most of my work with python uses almost the same modules as well as default settings so I want to do this once for all.
This is what I did:
1. put export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonrc into ~/.bashrc file
2. put the following code into the /.pythonrc file</p>
<pre><code>    from pylab import *
    import os
    rc('font', **{'family': 'serif', 'serif': ['Computer Modern']})
    rc('text', usetex=True)
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I run the following code
python3 test.py
with the test.py containing the simple code like this:</p>
<pre><code>    os.chdir('/Users/username/Documents/python/test/')
    datadax=loadtxt('py_dax.txt')
    datashaxn=loadtxt('py_shaxn.txt')
    datashaxw=loadtxt('py_shaxw.txt')
</code></pre>
<p>It gives me the error: NameError: name 'os' is not defined</p>
<p>I am not sure which step I did wrong.</p>

<p>It seems what you want is only possible <em><strong>in interactive mode</strong></em>!  </p>

<p>From the Python Â» Documentation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#environment-variables" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PYTHONSTARTUP</a></p>
<p>If this is the name of a readable file,<br/>
     the Python commands in that file are executed before the first prompt is displayed <strong>in interactive mode</strong>. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">What gives expanded <code>$HOME</code>, and <code>/.pythonrc</code> is different from <code>./pythonrc</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@stovfl sorry this is a typo.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. Indeed you are right. However, I also tired the interactive way. I typed python(3) in the terminal and I tried the command 'os.chdir('/Users/username/Documents/python/test/')'. The same error appears. Also I would like to know if there is a way to achieve this when I execute the whole *.py profile.</span>
