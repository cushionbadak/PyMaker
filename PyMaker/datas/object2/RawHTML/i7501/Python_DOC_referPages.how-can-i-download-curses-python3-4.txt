<span class="comment-copy">What OS are you on?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>curses</code> is a standard Python module.  You shouldn't need to install anything to use it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, so it is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> curses that is in question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jasonharper <i>However</i>, windows has no equivalent... Something tells me OP is on windows and does not have curses. The answer is, there is no curses.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So if I'm on windows I cant use curses?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The command you sent didn't work. Once i download the file from the website what do I do please and thanks?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">pip install curses-2.2-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry I keep asking I feel im being really stupid "Requirement 'curses-2.2-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl' looks like a filename, but the file does not exist"</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>Once i download the file from the website</i> — did you download it finally?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes I think so.</span>
