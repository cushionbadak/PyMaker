<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>my python code so far is:</p>
<pre><code>list=("Member ID, Surname, Year joined, Nights booked, Membership status, Points balance")
f = open("SampleData2017.txt")
print(list)
for surname in f.readlines():
   print(surname)
</code></pre>
<p>however when i run it the items are only seperated by commas and not under each subheading</p>
<p>i want it to look like:</p>
<pre><code>MemberID  Surname  Year  joined Membershipstatus  Nightsbooked  Points balance
Gri33415 Griffiths    2015         Gold               35          40000

Smi22316  Smith       2016        Silver              3            7500
</code></pre>
<p>how would i fix this? as simple as possible please</p>

<p>I guess you can use python built in csv module to achieve what you want</p>
<p>Edit 1: </p>
<p>Observe headers is assigned initially as string and then converted list</p>
<p>added ljust to each items to give an idea how this can be achieved, but definitely not the exact alignment the way you want.</p>
<pre><code>import csv
headers="Member ID, Surname, Year joined, Nights booked, Membership status, Points balance"
headers = headers.split(',')

print ('\t'.join(x.ljust(5) for x in headers))

with open('WorkingDirectory\stars.csv', 'r') as mycsv:
    rows = csv.reader(mycsv)
    for row in rows:
        print ('\t'.join(x.ljust(15) for x in row))
</code></pre>
<p>Original Answer:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

headers=["Member ID, Surname, Year joined, Nights booked, Membership status, Points balance"]

print ('\t'.join(headers))

with open('SampleData2017.txt', 'r') as mycsv:
    rows = csv.reader(mycsv)
    for row in rows:
        print ('\t'.join(row))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Member ID, Surname, Year joined, Nights booked, Membership status, Points balance
Gri33415    Griffiths   2015    Gold    35  40000

<p>Sounds like you have a list of headers, and a table full of data you're pulling from <code>SampleData2017.txt</code>. There's a third-party module called <code>tabulate</code> that I use a lot for this because it keeps me from having to write a bunch of code for a simple task.</p>
<p>Install it from pypi using pip on your command line.</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install tabulate
</code></pre>
<p>or on Python3</p>
<pre><code>$ pip3 install tabulate
</code></pre>
<p>Then write code:</p>
<pre><code>import tabulate

headers = map(str.strip, "Member ID, Surname, Year joined, Nights booked, Membership status, Points balance".split(","))
# or just format it yourself:
headers = ("Member ID", "Surname", "Year joined", "Nights booked",
           "Membership status", "Points balance")

with open("SampleData2017.txt") as f:
    # you never say how each row is split into fields, so I'm assuming here
    # that it's comma-separated and calling str.split(",") on each
    table = tabulate.tabulate((line.split(",") for line in f), headers=headers)
</code></pre>
<p>With my sample data here, the output is:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; headers = ("one", "two", "three")
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)]

&gt;&gt;&gt; print(tabulate.tabulate(data, headers=headers))
  one    two    three
-----  -----  -------
    1      2        3
    4      5        6
    7      8        9
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you please show exactly how you expect the output to look like?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please edit your question and put your expectation in the question, not the comments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i made it more specific if that helps</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>list</code> is a bad name for a variable because you overwrite the builtin <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list</code></a>. In this case it's even worse and leads to false assumptions, because what you call a list is in fact a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much, but is there any way that they may align better under each heading?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Answer Updated but may not be perfect for your use case. but you can tweak a little if it is suitable.   Else you need to assign length for each columns and do <code>ljust</code> for each element based on your header length f each names. Let me know if you need any assistance here</span>
