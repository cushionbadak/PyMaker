<p>I've been told that iterating over a list as such is not appropriately pythonic. How do I make this part...</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(0, len(word)):
            if words[i] == guess:
                guessable_list[i] = guess
                letters_to_guess -= 1
</code></pre>
<p>more pythonic. </p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>I'm working on a problem (the last problem called hangman) assigned MIT OC. I am working on this stuff by myself. So far the material is accessible and well taught. However, since I don't have a supervisor coupled with the awareness of how bad habits can develop when doing I would really appreciate it if anyone could look at my code and see if I'm doing anything wrong - from the use of idioms or my structuring of my code. Any feedback is appreciated.
Thank you all!        </p>
<p>I have tried doing this...</p>
<pre><code>for letter in words:
        if letter == guess:
            guessable_list[word.index(letter)] = guess
            letters_to_guess -= 1
</code></pre>
<p>but I encountered trouble where if a letter appears twice in a word it isn't replaced.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> here:</p>
<pre><code>for index, word in enumerate(words):
    if word == guess:
        guessable_list[index] = guess
        letters_to_guess -= 1
</code></pre>
