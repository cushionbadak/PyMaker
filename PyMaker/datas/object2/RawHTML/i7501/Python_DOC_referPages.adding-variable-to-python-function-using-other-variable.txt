<p>I would like pass the variables into the function that uses range(). How do I pass variable C that has more then one number via one variable. Something like range(5, 10, 2)?</p>
<p>Here is my example code: </p>
<pre><code>a = 0
b = 10
c = 2   
def num_count(a, b, c):
        for number in range(c):
            a += b
        print("New Count is: {0}".format(a))
</code></pre>
<p>I tried passing it as a string and converting it to an integer as well as by using a list. Nothing worked.  </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can pass in the range like you mentioned with only a small change to the 
for loop</p>
<pre><code>a = 0
b = 10
c = range(5, 10, 2)   
def num_count(a, b, c):
    for number in c:
        a += b
    print("New Count is: {0}".format(a))

num_count(a,b,c)
</code></pre>
<p>or, as khelwood* mentioned, pass in a list/tuple and expand it with <code>*</code></p>
<pre><code>a = 0
b = 10
c = (5, 10, 2)   
def num_count(a, b, c):
    for number in range(*c):
        a += b
    print("New Count is: {0}".format(a))

num_count(a,b,c)
</code></pre>
<p>both output 30 which is expected </p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You mean like <code>c=(5,10,2)</code> then <code>range(*c)</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. I keep getting errors that I am passing a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then stop passing a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Create the <code>range</code> outside the function and pass it in…? What's the best approach is very debatable with such artificial scenarios.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It means "expand this variable" so it becomes three arguments to <code>range</code>. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/…</a></span>
