<p>I have a script for Python 2 to login into a webpage and then move inside to reach a couple of files pointed to on the same site, but different pages. Python 2 let me open the site with my credentials and then create a <code>opener.open()</code> to keep the connection available to navigate to the other pages. </p>
<p>Here's the code that worked in Python 2:</p>
<pre><code>$Your admin login and password
LOGIN = "*******"
PASSWORD = "********"
ROOT = "https:*********"

#The client have to take care of the cookies.
jar = cookielib.CookieJar()
opener = urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.HTTPCookieProcessor(jar))

#POST login query on '/login_handler' (post data are: 'login' and 'password').
req = urllib2.Request(ROOT + "/login_handler",
                      urllib.urlencode({'login': LOGIN,
                                        'password': PASSWORD}))
opener.open(rep)

#Set the right accountcode

for accountcode, queues in QUEUES.items():
    req = urllib2.Request(ROOT + "/switch_to" + accountcode)
    opener.open(req)
</code></pre>
<p>I need to do the same thing in Python 3. I have tried with request module and urllib, but although I can establish the first login, I don't know how to keep the opener to navigate the site. I found the OpenerDirector but it seems like I don't know how to do it, because I haven't reached my goal. </p>
<p>I have used this Python 3 code to get the result desired but unfortunately I can't get the csv file to print it.

<p><strong>Question</strong>: I don't know how to keep the opener to navigate the site.  </p>

<p>Use of Basic HTTP Authentication:</p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request
# Create an OpenerDirector with support for Basic HTTP Authentication...
auth_handler = urllib.request.HTTPBasicAuthHandler()
auth_handler.add_password(realm='PDQ Application',
                      uri='https://mahler:8092/site-updates.py',
                      user='klem',
                      passwd='kadidd!ehopper')

opener = urllib.request.build_opener(auth_handler)

# ...and install it globally so it can be used with urlopen.
urllib.request.install_opener(opener)
f = urllib.request.urlopen('http://www.example.com/login.html')
csv_content = f.read()

<p>Use python requests library for python 3 and session.
<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#session-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#session-objects</a></p>
<p>Once you login your session will be automatically managed. You dont need to create your own cookie jar. Following is the sample code.</p>
<pre><code>s = requests.Session()
auth={"login":LOGIN,"pass":PASS}
url=ROOT+/login_handler
r=s.post(url, data=auth)
print(r.status_code)
for accountcode, queues in QUEUES.items():
    req = s.get(ROOT + "/switch_to" + accountcode)
    print(req.text) #response text

<span class="comment-copy">Please show your python 3 code and the errors you get</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Current Python 3 docs have good example of urllib opener &amp; sample code that works, see: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/urllib2.html?highlight=urllib" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/howto/urllib2.html?highlight=urllib</a> Section: Basic Authentication</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the problem for me is cause i have to use an user and password then after the log in keep on navigating the site (this is why the opener) and then download the files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">check my comment below..</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i><b>it didn't work</b></i>  Doesn't help,  Check Response Error or Code you got. Have you verfied the Login was successful? <b>PLEASE</b> don't use <code>Answer</code> for your Comments, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/44988367/edit">edit</a> your Question accordingly. <b>PLEASE</b>don't use Pictures  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/44988367/edit">edit</a> your Question an add your current <code>Python3</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">May I see <code>print(f.status)</code> and  <code>print(f.reason)</code>. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/44988367/edit">Edit</a> your Question accordingly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">unfortunatelly it didnt work neither, I cant complete the required login before start to read.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you change the parameters appropriately?For username and password.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes I did but it looks like I can't complete the authentication for that. the password and user are ok cause each time that I'M try with my browser that works</span>
