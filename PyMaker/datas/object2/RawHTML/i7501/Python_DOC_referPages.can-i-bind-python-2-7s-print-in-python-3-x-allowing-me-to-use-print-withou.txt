<p>I like python <strong>2</strong>'s <code>print "TEXT"</code> which does not use without parenthesis, compared to <code>print("TEXT")</code> in python <strong>3</strong>. </p>
<p>Can I keep the python 2 print around to use by binding it to something like <code>pr</code>? </p>
<p>I understand has been discussed in this thread, but this wasn't mentioned as one of the solutions:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32122868/python-3-print-without-parenthesis">Python 3 print without parenthesis</a></p>
<p>(By the way, the issue for me is typing and escaping the brackets. The keys <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> harder to press than a space bar. Also, because my IDE puts them in automatically, I then need to move my cursor out of it.)</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: This is neither a duplicate of the question as indicated NOR am I asking how to use python-3.x's print without parenthesis.</strong> Instead, I'm specifically asking if I can bind a python 2 function (presumably after importing it). If the answer is no, that is new information. </p>

<p>In order to achieve what you want you need to define your own keyword, but you can't do this as you can't define or redefine language keywords without rewriting a compiler/interpreter/etc.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Easiest solution: Use python 2 :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On a more serious note, short of changing python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">grammar specification</a> you absolutely cannot remove those brackets. The language has been built to recognise and parse functions this way, there's just no way around it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In python 2 <code>print</code> is a keyword that triggers a statement. It's not a value that you can assign to something.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@JimFasarakisHilliard don't worry, I'm fine: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44921948/change-name-of-dictionary-or-list-in-a-loop" title="change name of dictionary or list in a loop">stackoverflow.com/questions/44921948/â€¦</a>  :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As as in the question, I'm specifically asking if I can bind python-2.7's "print" function (presumably after importing it) to another one, i.e. "pr".</span>
