<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would like to loop as something like:</p>
<pre><code>for j in range(1,4) and for k in ['one', 'two', 'three']:
               print(str(j) + ' is written ' + k)
</code></pre>
<p>I tried with <code>and</code> but it didn't work. How does someone get this effect?</p>
<p>And what would happen in the case that the two lists have different lengths? How could I still iterate through both of them?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>zip</code></p>
<pre><code>for j, k in zip(range(1,4), ['one', 'two', 'three']):
    print('{} is written {}'.format(j, k))    

1 is written one
2 is written two
3 is written three
</code></pre>
<p>If one is longer than the other, you could consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest" rel="noreferrer"><code>itertools.zip_longest</code></a></p>

<p>Check this out:</p>
<pre><code>for j,k in enumerate(['one', 'two', 'three'], 1):
    print("{} is written {}".format(j, k))
</code></pre>

<p>You should <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> 'em all!</p>
<pre><code>for j, k in zip(range(1,4), ("one", "two", "three")):
    # use j and k

<span class="comment-copy">Why <i>two downvotes</i>?? You don't  like Pok√©mon? Or the <code>zip</code> function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not the downvoter, but I think there might be debate between which answer might be <i>better</i> between zip and enumerate.</span>
