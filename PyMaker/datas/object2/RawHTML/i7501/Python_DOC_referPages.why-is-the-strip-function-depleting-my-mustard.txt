<p>I'm creating a Hot Dog simulator in python, with a class "HotDog".<br/>
When I'm formatting the string, if there are 2 condiments, I wrote this code to add it to the string:</p>
<pre><code>if len(self.condiments) == 2:
    for i in self.condiments:
        msg = msg + i + " and "
    msg = msg.strip(" and ") 
</code></pre>
<p>If the second condiment is "mustard", the strip() function is taking away the "d" of mustard, so the string prints like this:</p>
<pre><code>Raw hot dog with ketchup and mustar.
</code></pre>
<p>I've used trial and error to find more info, and it seems "d" is the only letter that will disappear, i.e.: mustarg and mustarb will be fine.<br/>
Also, it seems to be the "a" of <code>msg = msg.strip(" and ")</code> that is causing the problem.<br/>
If I only strip "d " or "nd ", mustard will be fine. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That's the documented feature. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>the characters in the string</em> will be stripped from the both ends of the string this method is called on</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you initially did <code>a raw hotdog</code>, then you'd end up with <code>raw hotdog</code></p>
<p>How about instead you used</p>
<pre><code> " and ".join(condiments)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If I only strip "d " or "nd ", mustard will be fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you'd have an <code>a</code> at the end of the message, no? </p>

<p>The <code>strip</code> method doesn't work the way you seem to expect. Its argument is a sequence of characters that will be removed if they appear in any order (and any number of times) at either end of your string. So when you pass in <code>" and "</code>, you're telling it to strip off all spaces, <code>'a'</code>, <code>'n'</code> and <code>'d'</code> characters. Since the <code>'d'</code> in <code>'mustard'</code> is one of those characters, it will be stripped if it's at the end.</p>
<p>A better way to remove a specific amount of text from the end of a string would be to slice it: <code>msg = msg[:-5]</code> will remove the last five characters.</p>
<p>Or you can avoid creating the extra <code>" and "</code> in any number of ways, such as using <code>str.format</code> or <code>str.join</code> (or a combination of the two).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That's what <code>.strip</code> is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documented</a> to do, yes. <i>"The chars argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped"</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How about <code>' and '.join(self.condiments)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or <code>msg = msg[:-len(" and ")]</code></span>
