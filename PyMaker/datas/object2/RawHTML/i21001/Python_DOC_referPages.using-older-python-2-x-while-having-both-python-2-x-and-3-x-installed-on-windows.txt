<p>I'm new to python. I've installed both Python 3.2.2 for x64 and Python 2.7 for x86 on my 64-bit windows machine. I've got some python code that are coded for python 2.x versions. But every time I try to run them by double clicking it is interpreted by python 3.x.</p>
<p>How do I force them to use python version 2.7, may be using some directives or using a BATCH script?</p>

<p>Going forward, the solution is to upgrade Python 3.2 to 3.3 or later and use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows" rel="nofollow">Python Launcher for Windows</a>.</p>
<p>At the top of each Python 3 program, include the following line:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
</code></pre>
<p>At the top of each Python 2 program, include the following line:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python2
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>#!</code> part, called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)" rel="nofollow">shebang</a>, indicates to Python Launcher which version of Python is desired. (It also indicates to UNIX that a program should be run with a particular interpreter instead of the shell.) The <code>/usr/bin/env</code> part helps locate the Python interpreter on your <code>PATH</code> when you run a program on UNIX. If you don't plan on using anything but Windows, you can leave it out:</p>
<pre><code>#! python3

[or]

#! python2
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could, e.g., associate the file extension <code>.py2</code> with Python 2.7 and rename the main file (assuming you regard Python 3.2 as your default version).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>open a command line window, and use <code>"c:\python27\python.exe" yourscript.py</code> (or whatever path your python 2.7 appears to be installed in).</p>
<p>of course, you can put that line into a batch file and execute the batch.</p>
<p>also, you can put a shortcut to <code>c:\python27\python.exe</code> on your desktop and drop your script onto that shortcut every time you want to run it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try editing <code>PATH</code> environment variable, use python 2.7 path and delete python 3.2.2</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Can't delete python 3.2.2 from PATH. It's required for other software.</span>
