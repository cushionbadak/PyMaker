<p>I am using Python 2 to make an app that counts the string words number and letters number.</p>
<pre><code>def string_length(aStr):
    number_of_words = len(aStr.split())
    number_of_letters = len(aStr)
    return number_of_words, number_of_letters

print string_length("my name is ahmed") #Returns (4, 16)
</code></pre>
<p>How can I turn (4, 16) to:</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>16</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since the <code>string_length</code> function is returning a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tuple</a>, you have to <em>unpack</em> them before printing.</p>
<pre><code>def string_length(aStr):
    number_of_words = len(aStr.split())
    number_of_letters = len(aStr)
    return number_of_words, number_of_letters

# Unpacking the tuple
words, letters = string_length('my name is ahmed')

print words
print letters
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>call the function like</p>
<pre><code>number_of_words, number_of_letters = string_length("Whatever string")
</code></pre>
<p>And then print the values</p>
<pre><code> print number_of_words
 print number_of_letters
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Google it man, seriously.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I searched and I couldn't find any solution, is there any problem if someone helps me here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Problem is this is an extremely trivial problem that you can find it on Google in 2 minutes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's unclear what you want to do with that <code>(4, 15)</code> tuple. You want to turn it into a 4 and a 16? Does that mean you want to store those two numbers in two different variables? Or are you trying to say that you want to <i>print</i> 4 and 16 to stdout?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Should my final code be: <code>def string_length(aStr):     number_of_words = len(aStr.split())     number_of_letters = len(aStr)  number_of_words, number_of_letters = string_length("aStr") print number_of_words print number_of_letters</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to read about functions. Go check them out.</span>
