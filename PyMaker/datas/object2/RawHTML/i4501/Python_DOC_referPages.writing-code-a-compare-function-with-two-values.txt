<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I need to write a program that takes two values <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> and returns</p>
<pre><code> 1 if x &gt;  y
 0 if x == y
-1 if x &lt;  y
</code></pre>
<p>I cannot figure out how to start this. I know how to do one value, but not sure where to add the second. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should work:</p>
<pre><code>def func (x, y):
    if x&gt;y:
        return 1
    elif x==y:
        return 0
    else:
        return -1
</code></pre>
<p>To get return:</p>
<pre><code>output=func(4, 6)
</code></pre>
<p>Or whatever</p>
</div>
