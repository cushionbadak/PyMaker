<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to write a program to take a string; find and remove vowel in string, change capital letter to small letter and added "." before each letter. Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code>input_string = "aBAcAba"
vowel = ["a","e","i","o","u"]
list = list(input_string.lower())

for letter in list:
    if letter in vowel:
        list.remove(letter)

result = ".".join(list)
print (result)
</code></pre>
<p>When I run this, I get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>b.c.b</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the desired result is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>.b.c.b</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why isn't <code>.</code> added before the first letter, and how can I fix it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of removing in place, use a list comprehension to create a new list:</p>
<pre><code>input_string = "aBAcAba"
vowel = {"a","e","i","o","u"}
new_string = ''.join(["."+i.lower() for i in input_string if i.lower() not in vowel])
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>'.b.c.b'
</code></pre>
<p>Also, changing <code>vowel</code> from a <code>list</code> to a <code>set</code> improves the overall lookup time.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>more simply</p>
<pre><code>input_string = "aBAcAba"
vowel = ["a","e","i","o","u"]
list = list(input_string.lower())

for letter in list:
    if letter in vowel:
        list.remove(letter)

result = "."+".".join(list)
print (result)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>result = ".".join(list) 
</code></pre>
<p>will not add "." before each letter, but will result like you are getting. 
if you want "." in starting also you can add extra "."</p>
<pre><code>result="."+".".join(list)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you just neeed to print it, you can add the <code>'.'</code> on the fly when printing it like this:</p>
<pre><code>print ('', *L, sep=".") # L being the list of remaining non-vowels
</code></pre>
<p>This will not create a string though as <code>print()</code> does not return the printed string. The other answers cover how to get the string already. I would still go for a list comprehension to create the partial list:</p>
<pre><code>input_string = "aBAcAba"
vowel = ["a","e","i","o","u"]

L = [c.lower() for c in input_string if c not in vowel] 

print ('', *L, sep=".") # *L unpacks it to: print('','b','c','b', sep =".") for your data
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>*L</code> will unpack the list, the <code>''</code> before will add an empty string before it. By declaring a <code>sep="."</code> print will seperate each thing it prints by a <code>'.'</code></p>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>.b.c.b
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>inp = 'aBAcAba'
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
'.'+'.'.join([c for c in inp.lower() if c not in vowels])
</code></pre>
<p>Basically the last line does the trick, it converts input to lower case, check character by character if it's a vowel, finally joins the list to output a string. additional <code>'.'</code> is added at the beginning of the string.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also use regular expressions to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Code:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import re

input_string = "aBAcAba"
consonants = re.sub(r'[aeoiu]', '', input_string.lower())
result = f".{'.'.join(consonants)}"
</code></pre>
<p>I formatted the result using a Python 3.6+ feature called <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Literal String Interpolation</a>. I encourage you to find out more about it.</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; result
'.b.c.b.'
</code></pre>
<p><code>r'[aeoiuy]'</code> is a pattern that matches one of the vowels within the square brackets.</p>
<p>You can read more about regular expressions <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> and use this <a href="https://regex101.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">site</a> to test if they match the string.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hello, I've made some substantial edits to your question. I strongly believe I've helped to clarify the problem you're having, but please check my work to ensure that I didn't change the question to be something that you didn't intend. It would also help us if you could edit the question to include what you might have searched for, because I'm pretty sure that's why you didn't find anything ;) Welcome to the site!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the "join" command unites all the parameters in the list with the character that you provide to them</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This won't work for an empty input string</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this will replace vowels by <code>.</code> - it does not work for <code>'klopaba'</code> (leads to <code>'kl.p.b.'</code>) as not every non-vowel is prefixed by a vowel. also your replace-pattern includes <code>y</code> which is not included in the questions list of vowels to be removed from the string (I am not the downvoter - just giving you a hint why you got dv...) I dislike downvotes w/o comments</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are right! ^^ I didn't read the whole question, my bad. I'll update my answer. He probably forgot about the <code>y</code>. As far as I know, it's a vowel :p</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jatimir I'd 100% argue that it isn't ;p</span>
<span class="comment-copy">not a vowel where I live - we even got Ä Ö Ü - and they aren't vowels either - or are they ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"These letters are vowels in English: A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y." I wrongly assumed that it always is. Oops. However in my native language it is always a vowel :D</span>
