<p>I am trying to make a program related to money and the user needs to input a decimal. But It always gives me an error. Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>price = input("What is the price of your vegetable?")
pounds = input("How many pounds did you buy?")

price = int(price)
pounds = int(pounds)

if pounds &lt; 5:
    price = price * 1
    print("Your price is " + str(price))
elif pounds &lt; 10:
    price = price * 0.90
    print("Your price is " + str(price))
elif pounds &lt; 20:
    price = price * 0.80
    print("Your price is " + str(price))
elif pounds &gt; 30:
    price = price * 0.75
    print("Your price is " + str(price))
</code></pre>
<p>And here is the error:</p>
<pre><code>What is the price of your vegetable?6.72
How many pounds did you buy?4
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:/Users/Jerry Cui/Documents/pricediscount.py", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
    price = int(price)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '6.72'
</code></pre>
<p>Can someone tell me where is the problem?</p>

<p>Use <code>float()</code> as you want to allow entry of floats!</p>
<p><strong>However,</strong> I suggest you <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3730040/7434365">read this</a>, which hopefully will convince you to right something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>price = input("What is the price of your vegetable? (pounds.pence, e.g: 3.42)")
price = int(price.replace(".", ""))
</code></pre>
<p>Now the price is stored as an integer, which is <em>much</em> more accurate than a float; especially when storing money (hence we use <code>int()</code> here again). </p>
