<p>So, I was playing with the interpreter, and typed in the following:</p>
<pre><code>In [95]: 1 and 2
Out[95]: 2

In [96]: 1 and 5
Out[96]: 5

In [97]: 234324 and 2
Out[97]: 2

In [98]: 234324 and 22343243242
Out[98]: 22343243242L

In [99]: 1 or 2 and 9
Out[99]: 1
</code></pre>
<p>Initially I thought that it has to do with False and True values, because:</p>
<pre><code>In [101]: True + True
Out[101]: 2

In [102]: True * 5
Out[102]: 5
</code></pre>
<p>But that doesn't seem related, because False is always 0, and it seems from the trials above that it isn't the biggest value that is being outputted.</p>
<p>I can't see the pattern here honestly, and couldn't find anything in the documentation (honestly, I didn't really know how to effectively look for it). </p>
<p>So, how does </p>
<pre><code>int(x) [logical operation] int(y)
</code></pre>
<p>work in Python? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From the Python documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The expression <code>x and y</code> first evaluates <code>x</code>; if <code>x</code> is false, its
  value is returned; otherwise, <code>y</code> is evaluated and the resulting value
  is returned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is exactly what your experiment shows happening. All of your <code>x</code> values are true, so the <code>y</code> value is returned.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's for every item in Python, it's not dependent on the integer.</p>
<pre><code>not x   Returns True if x is True, False otherwise
x and y Returns x if x is False, y otherwise
x or y  Returns y if x is False, x otherwise
</code></pre>
<p>1 is True, so it will return 2</p>

<span class="comment-copy">In Python, <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> perform boolean logic as you would expect, but they do not return boolean values; instead, they return one of the actual values they are comparing.  <a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/power_of_introspection/and_or.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">diveintopython.net/power_of_introspection/and_or.html</a></span>
