<p>By using the code below, I am getting the directory from the source to the destination. However, the time of the destination directory and the source is changed.</p>
<pre><code>import os,time,os.path,shutil
shutil.copytree(sourceFolderPath, destinationFolderPath)
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to copy the source directory with their time stamp. Any ideas?</p>

<p>First <strong>warning</strong> on the <strong>docs</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even the higher-level file copying functions (shutil.copy(),
  shutil.copy2()) <strong>cannot copy all file metadata</strong>.</p>
<p>On POSIX platforms, this means that file owner and group are lost as
  well as ACLs. On Mac OS, the resource fork and other metadata are not
  used. This means that resources will be lost and file type and creator
  codes will not be correct. On Windows, file owners, ACLs and alternate
  data streams are not copied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>shutil.copytree</code> uses <code>shutil.copy2()</code>by default:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Permissions and times of directories are copied with copystat(),
  individual files are copied using shutil.copy2()</p>
</blockquote>

<span class="comment-copy">1) This should work. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copytree" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Permissions and times of directories are copied with copystat()"</a> 2) What do you mean by "the source is changed"?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">shutil.copytree copy all, but with new time stamp of directory. But I  want source directory time stamp in destination.</span>
