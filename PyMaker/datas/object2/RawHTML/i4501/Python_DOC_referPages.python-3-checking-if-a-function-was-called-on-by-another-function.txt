<p>In python 3, is there a way to check if another function executed a particular function? I want the computer to do something if a function was called by the itself and something else if another function called it. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>def x():
    y()

def y():
    """Psuedocode ---&gt;""" 
    if function y was called by function x:
        print ("function y was called by another function")
    elif function y was not called by function x:
        print ("function y was called not called by another function")

Input ----&gt; x()
Output ---&gt; function y was called by another function

Input ---&gt; y()
Output ---&gt; function y was not called by another function
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the Python feature called "Inspect". It returns a list of frame records. The third element in each record is the caller name. Refer docs here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html</a> </p>
<pre><code>import inspect
def x():
    print inspect.stack()[1][3]

def y():
    x()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Be aware that this method is fairly unreliable for production environments since it depends on the implementation of the underlying CPython.</span>
