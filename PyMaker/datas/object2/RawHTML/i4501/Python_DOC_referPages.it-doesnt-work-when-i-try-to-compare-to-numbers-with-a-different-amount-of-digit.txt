<p>I have some code that lets someone input two numbers, which it then assigns to variables. Then later it compares the numbers given. <code>Fx. if a &lt; b elif a &gt; b</code>.
This works fine until the two numbers have a different amount of digits.
<code>Fx. a=12</code> and <code>b=111</code>. It will read 111 as 11 and think that 12 is higher. How do I fix this?</p>

<p>You have strings, not ints. The string <code>'111'</code> comes before <code>'12'</code> for the same reason "aaa" would come before "ab" in the dictionary if those were words; strings are ordered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lexicographically</a>.</p>
<p>Make ints with <code>int(your_string)</code>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I can only guess that this is the solution (including a [mcve] would help):</p>
<pre><code>a = int(input())
b = int(input())

if a &lt; b:
    #code here
</code></pre>
<p>This works because "input()" returns a "str" in python 3.x (that's what I think you're using). Read more about it here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your numbers are strings. You need some numeric type, like <code>int</code> or <code>float</code>.</span>
