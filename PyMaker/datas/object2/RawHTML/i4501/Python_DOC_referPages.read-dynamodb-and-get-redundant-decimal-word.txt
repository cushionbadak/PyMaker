<p>when I scan dynamodb table, I got data which is some redundant"Decimal". I want to convert to below. Thanks.</p>
<pre><code>[{'year': '222', 'title': 'aaaaaas'}, {'year': '1111', 'title': 'dddd'}]
</code></pre>

<p>You are asking Python to print a list of dicts, without telling it how you want it to look. So what it is giving you is the representation you would need to use it in a Python program. And whoever stored the data decided to store <code>year</code> as a <code>Decimal</code>.</p>
<p>Your "redundant" <code>Decimal</code> will disappear if you tell Python how you want your data to look:</p>
<pre><code>a =[{'year': Decimal('222'), 'title': 'aaaaaas'}, {'year': Decimal('1111'), 'title': 'dddd'}]
for d in a:
    for (k,v) in d.items():
        print (k,"=",v)

year = 222
title = aaaaaas
year = 1111
title = dddd
</code></pre>
<p>You don't need to convert the <code>Decimal</code> into a <code>str</code>. It will print out correctly when the time comes to display it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you want to turn the number into a string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I check my dynamodb, "year" type is number, not string, I entry that "year": 222 to dynamodb</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But your example output shows it as a string. <code>Decimal</code> is a way of representing numbers in Python; did you read e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have checked your link. It is suitable for single "Decimal" word. Not for a list include "Decimal", But also thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know why my example output shows it as a string. But I really enter it as a number. Maybe you can try it in AWS?Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, now I now why "Decimal" appear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I check my dynamodb,  "year" type is number, not string, I entry that "year": 222 to dynamodb</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when I enter your code in aws lambda, it print ""year = {'year': Decimal('222'), 'title': 'aaaaaas'} \n year = {'year': Decimal('1111'), 'title': 'dddd'}""---"Decimal" still here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KennyChan Sorry, cut'n'paste of the wrong version of the test. Fixed.</span>
