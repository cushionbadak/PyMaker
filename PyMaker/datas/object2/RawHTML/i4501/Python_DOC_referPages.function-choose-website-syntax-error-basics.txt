<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to write a function to choose a website over several saved URLs.
My function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>website = ''
def choose_website(website_name):
  nfl = 'https://www.nfl.com'
  nba = 'http://www.nba.com'
  fifa = 'http://www.fifa.com'
  If website_name = "nfl":
      website = nfl
  elif website_name = "nba":
      website = nba
  elif website_name = "fifa":
      website = fifa
  else:
      print 'Invalid website, please try again'
choose_website(raw_input("Please insert website(nfl/nba/fifa): ")
</code></pre>
<p>In short, I store the websites URLS in their names, and I ask the user to enter the names and this will store the desired website URL in the "website" variable.
However when I try to run this, I received a syntax error:</p>
<pre><code>  If website_name = "nfl":
            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Process finished with exit code 1
</code></pre>
<p>I have no idea why it does that, can anyone help me?
I'm using Python 3.4</p>

<p>As people say <code>python is case sensitive. Change If to if</code>
and replace <code>=</code> to double <code>==</code>

<pre><code>  if website_name == "nfl":
  #^^             ^^
      website = nfl
  elif website_name == "nba":

      website = nba

<span class="comment-copy">The Capital I was only here in the post (accident, sorryyy) But the double equals solved it! thank you :D</span>
