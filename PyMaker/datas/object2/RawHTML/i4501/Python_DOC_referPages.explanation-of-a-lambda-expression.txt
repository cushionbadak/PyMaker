<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>lambda title: title.split(':')[0]
</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone make me understand why there is a '[0]' used after the split function. I am learning python and came across this. Any help is appreciated</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because [0] is the get operator of a list. The function <strong>split</strong> will return a list that consist of text string parts separated by colon (:). The lambda when invoked will return the first part of a text before any colon.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you get if you remove the <code>[0]</code>? Try it and it may answer your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>split(':')</code> returns a list of strings which are split around <code>:</code>. <code>[0]</code> is accessing the first index (the first split string).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@pault that was silly of me. Thanks though for the help</span>
