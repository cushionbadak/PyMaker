<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would like to know how to transfer a number.</p>
<p>For example: <code>[1,0,2,3,4]</code></p>
<p>Remove the one and transfer the one to two's position</p>
<p>Result: <code>[0,0,1,3,4]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If your manipulations are purely index-based, you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>lst = [1,0,2,3,4]
lst[2] = lst[0]
lst[0] = 0

# [0, 0, 1, 3, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, if you need to work out the index of 2:</p>
<pre><code>lst[lst.index(2)] = lst[0]
lst[0] = 0
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since you have not described your question with clear instructions, There is case when there will be more than one 2 or 1 in vector then what you want to do ?</p>
<p>My solution is only for that condition when there is single 1 and 2 in vector because when you use .index method it always returns first value index no matter there are other values too.</p>
<p>Since in your dataset there is always 1 times 1 and 2 in all vector so here is the solution for that </p>
<pre><code>data=[[1, 2, 3, 4, 0], [1, 3, 2, 4, 0], [2, 1, 3, 4, 0] ]

def replace_ (vector_ , replace_value, replace_with):

    memory=vector_.index(replace_with)

    vector_[vector_.index(replace_value)]=vector_[vector_.index(replace_with)]

    vector_[memory]=0


    return vector_


for i in data:
    print(replace_(i,1,2))
</code></pre>
<p>If there are more than one 1 or 2 in vector like <code>[1,0,1,1,2,2]</code> then describe your logic and edit your question for that.</p>
