<p>I have this piece of code:</p>
<pre><code>with io.open('csus.csv',mode='r',encoding='latin1') as csus:
  for line in csus:
</code></pre>
<p>And I need to ignore the first (header)line. Of course I can work with a virgin boolean, check it's value during the run of the for loop, when False digest the line and set it to False otherwise. 
But I was hoping to read the first line from the file(handle?) and continue with the <code>for loop</code></p>
<pre><code>csus.readline()
</code></pre>
<p>does not have the expected effect, is it possible and what should I use?</p>
<p>As as a side question should I close the csus file? I don't think this was done in the example I copied it from and I wonder wether this <code>with .. as ..</code> statement already incorporates the close()?</p>

<p>You can do this with:</p>
<pre><code>with io.open('csus.csv',mode='r',encoding='latin1') as csus:
    next(csus)
    for line in csus:
        # do something
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>with</code> statement takes care of closing the file for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this:</p>
<p><code>enumerate</code> and skip the first line</p>
<pre><code>import io
with io.open('csus.csv',mode='r') as csus:
  for i, row in enumerate(csus):
      if(i==0):
          pass
      else:
        print(str(i) + " " + row)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can easily achieve  it with below code:</p>
<pre><code>with open('any.txt', 'r') as f:
    for i, line in enumerate(f):
        if i &gt; 0:
            print(line) # Change to line.strip() to get rid of new line after everyline
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><i>"<code>csus.readline()</code> does not have the expected effect"</i> Are you <i>sure</i>? It works for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Consider looking into the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv</a> module to do this for you. It's builtin to Python, so you don't have to install anything extra</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is the only one that doesn't run some sort of branch for each line of code</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>'{} {}'.format(i, row)</code> is much sexier (read pythonic).</span>
