<p>I have a Julian date: 736257, I need help converting it from Julian date to Gregorian date in Python.</p>

<p>The term "Julian date" has two different meanings, and different variations for each.</p>
<p>I think you're looking for the "days since epoch" meaning, and using the 1 Jan 1 CE epoch rather than the more common astronomers' epoch of 4713 BCE or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day#Variants" rel="nofollow noreferrer">any of the other alternatives</a>. You can adjust that pretty easily.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.date(1, 1, 1) + datetime.timedelta(days=736257)
datetime.date(2016, 10, 21)
</code></pre>
<p>That's all there is to it. (Which is the point of using Julian dates in the first place.)</p>
<hr/>
<p>Notice that under the covers, <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/datetime.py#L82" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this is the same format Python <code>datetime</code> is already using</a>, for its <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#date-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>date</code></a> and <code>datetime</code> types, except that Python uses midnight UTC instead of local noon. If that's what you want, it's even easier:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.date.fromordinal(736257)
datetime.date(2016, 10, 20, 0, 0)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@ndmeiri This appears to be the "days since 1AD" meaning of Julian date rather than the "year * 1000 + days since the start of this year" meaning, so that question and its answers won't help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just to be clear, the number you've chosen translates to Friday, Oct  6, 2698 B.C.  Does that match your expectation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Robáµ© I suspect he means 21 Oct 2016. Astronomers aren't the only ones who use JDNs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks abarnert, how to i convert the gregorian date back to Julian date?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">All the options are in the docs I linked. You can use <code>toordinal</code> to get the Python definition, you can subtract <code>date(1,1,1)</code> to get a <code>timedelta</code> and pull the days out of that to get the other definition, etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, i use the toordinal .                                                       &gt;&gt;&gt;from datetime import datetime                                                      &gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.strptime("2016-10-20", "%Y-%m-%d").toordinal()</span>
