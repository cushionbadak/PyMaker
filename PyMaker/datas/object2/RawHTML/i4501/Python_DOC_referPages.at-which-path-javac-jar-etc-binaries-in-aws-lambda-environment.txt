<p>We want to know where(at which path) javac, jar etc., tools in lambda environment, for use them to compile ".java" files to ".class" and construct ".jar" from AWS-Lambda in Python language through running CLI-commands.</p>
<p>Don't misunderstand my question, our requirement is to 
1. Generate Java source_code files from some rules_source
2. Then we need to compile these generated java-src and need to construct jar file
3. Finally store that in S3 BUCKET and allow user to download through another service.</p>
<p>Here with lambda alone we couldn't do 2nd step. So, we took EC2 instance to compile java-source generated and store back to S3.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest serverless-solution for this scenario. Is it possible?</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance.</p>

<p>You should be able to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess</code></a> to call <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/which" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>which</code></a> and find the path of an executable.</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
path = subprocess.check_output(["which", "javac"])

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, But Javac  and Jar tools are not found in the environment of lambda</span>
