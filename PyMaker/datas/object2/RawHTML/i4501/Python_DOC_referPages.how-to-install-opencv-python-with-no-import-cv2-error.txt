<p>I am trying to install the OpenCV-python on my mac and i have used the following:</p>
<p>$pip install opencv-python</p>
<p>which gave me the following error:</p>
<pre><code>$pip install opencv-python

matplotlib 1.3.1 requires nose, which is not installed.
matplotlib 1.3.1 requires tornado, which is not installed.
Installing collected packages: numpy, opencv-python
  Found existing installation: numpy 1.8.0rc1
Cannot uninstall 'numpy'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.

<p>Then i did try the <code>pip install --upgrade matplotlib</code> which didnot change anything. It just show me:</p>
<pre><code>matplotlib 2.2.2 requires backports.functools-lru-cache, which is not installed.
matplotlib 2.2.2 has requirement numpy&gt;=1.7.1, but you'll have numpy 1.8.0rc1 which is incompatible.
</code></pre>
<p>As I found many ways to install the openCV-python in the internet like:
<a href="https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/15/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-osx/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/15/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-osx/</a></p>
<p>and I installed on my other mac but i got import cv2 problem alot in my codes.
I will be more than happy if anyone have a good solution or recommendation to install the openCV-python.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>In summary, macOS comes with the Python preinstalled and you should not mess with the packages installed as some system utilities depend on them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Apple-provided build of Python is installed in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework and /usr/bin/python, respectively. You should never modify or delete these, as they are Apple-controlled and are used by Apple- or third-party software. Remember that if you choose to install a newer Python version from python.org, you will have two different but functional Python installations on your computer, so it will be important that your paths and usages are consistent with what you want to do.</p>

<p>You should take a look on either <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">venv</a> or <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">virtualenv</a>.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, to solve your problem:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 -m venv ./project-name
$ . ./project-name/bin/activate
$ pip install opencv-python
</code></pre>
<p>And to leave the virtual environment, simply:</p>
<pre><code>$ deactivate

<span class="comment-copy">if you're working on mac, use <code>homebrew</code> to (re)install python and pip. Then you can also use <code>brew install opencv3 --with-python</code> to install opencv. Mac's built-in python is always a problem for me.</span>
