<p>I have a class sendmail and I am trying to call it in other classes.The <code>argument</code> will determine which email to send. The <code>argument</code> in the sendmail class will send mail according to parameters given to it from other classes where it is being called.However,when executing it, I get error message saying <code>argument</code> not defined.</p>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
import smtplib
class sendmail(argument):

  TO = 'yourmail@gmail.com'
  if argument=='PIR':
    SUBJECT = 'PIR'
    TEXT = 'Motion is detected'

  gmail_sender = 'mymail@gmail.com'
  gmail_passwd = 'mypwd'

  server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
  server.ehlo()
  server.starttls()
  server.ehlo
  server.login(gmail_sender, gmail_passwd)

  BODY = '\r\n'.join([
       'TO: %s' % TO,
       'From: %s' % gmail_sender ,
       'Subject: %s' % SUBJECT ,
       '',
       TEXT
       ])
  try:
    server.sendmail(gmail_sender, [TO], BODY)
    print 'email sent'
  except:
    print 'error'

  server.quit()

<p>I think what you're looking for is a static function.</p>
<pre><code>import smtplib
class MailUtils:
    @staticmethod    
    def sendmail(argument):

          TO = 'yourmail@gmail.com'
          if argument=='PIR':
            SUBJECT = 'PIR'
            TEXT = 'Motion is detected'

          gmail_sender = 'mymail@gmail.com'
          gmail_passwd = 'mypwd'

          server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
          server.ehlo()
          server.starttls()

</code></pre>
<p>You would use it by doing this:</p>
<pre><code>import MailUtils
MailUtils.sendmail(argument)
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note: As mentioned in the comments below, this approach works best if the class contains multiple related functions, not just a single one.</em></p>

<span class="comment-copy">You're trying to use a class like a function. Don't do that. Read a tutorial on classes (maybe the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official Python tutorial chapter</a>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>argument</code> is supposed to be a class to inherit from</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This looks like you meant to create a function, not a class</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Meanwhile, if you want people to debug your code, you need to provide a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>. We can tell you what's wrong with this code, but we can't tell you how to write it properly if we don't know exactly what "parameters given to it from other classes" means, or how you're trying to use this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Elfinforest If you can't understand what classes are for and how they're used, just don't use one. You definitely don't need a class for this problem. When you later run into a problem where you <i>do</i> need a class, all the abstract nonsense in the tutorial will match up with real things in your real problem, so it'll be easier to understand.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A class should not be used this way. The class only contains a static method and is thus totally useless. Only use a function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OlivierMelançon He said in his question that he wanted to use it in other classes (plural), unless you want to rewrite the function every time, a static function is the most organized.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then it should be a function, and other classes will call a function, not a static method. The only real point of static methods is grouping a bunch of functions in a same namespace, which is not the case here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OlivierMelançon The way I've understood it is that it's a way of putting functions into a class because it belongs there logically, but it doesn't need access to the class itself. So, in this case, if you have a "Mail" class (or a "MailUtils" class), the sendmail static method belongs there, just for the sake of making the program more readable. I do understand that they are not needed most of the time, but I still like how it organizes things. (I'm of course open to being wrong, just trying to understand what you mean). :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A MailUtils class with other static methods would make sense. A Mail class with a single one, not so much. I suggest you add that as a note/warning.</span>
