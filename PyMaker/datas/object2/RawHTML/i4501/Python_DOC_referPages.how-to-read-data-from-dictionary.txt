<p>I have been making a Python game and need some help. I want to be able to have a user craft a item (I have made this) and some items to take longer. I am not sure how to get the number of seconds to wait from an array.</p>
<p>Example Dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>TimeToCraft = {
                   'missile' : 10,
                   'otherThing' : 100,
              }
</code></pre>
<p>Any idea how I could read the number from the dictionary above and input it into a time.sleep() function?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To get a value form a dictionary, you use the format:</p>
<pre><code>dictionaryName[key]
</code></pre>
<p>In your case, the dictionaryName is TimeToCraft and the key is 'missile' or 'otherThing'.</p>
<p>You would then put the value retrieved from the dictionary into time.sleep() :</p>
<pre><code>time.sleep(TimeToCraft['missile'])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try below : </p>
<pre><code>time.sleep(TimeToCraft['missile'])
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>time.sleep(TimeToCraft['otherThing'])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is a <em>dictionary</em>, not an <em>array</em> - which is good because it is the right data structure.</p>
<p>You do not index the element you want like you would in a list or array, you can merely get it with square bracket (<code>[...]</code>) syntax.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>TimeToCraft['missile']
</code></pre>
<p>would return <code>10</code>.</p>
<p>So once you have the user's entry (let's name this <code>item</code>), just pass the result into a <code>time.sleep</code> call (remember to <code>import time</code> fist).</p>
<pre><code>time.sleep(TimeToCraft[item])
</code></pre>
<p>One last thing is to remember to check that <code>item</code> is actually a valid entry in the dictionary.</p>
<p>This can be done with the <code>in</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code>if item in TimeToCraft:
    time.sleep(TimeToCraft[item])
else:
    print('sorry, don't have an entry for that item')
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">That isn't an array. It's a <i>dictionary</i>. You can find tutorials on how to access values from a dictionary by key.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok thanks I'm getting confused between the two. What's the difference?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to follow some tutorials first, for example, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are lots of differences, it would be best to look into some tutorials on this. In Python, the "list" might be considered as the equivalent of an array in other languages (searching for arrays in the context of python is likely to send you down a more complicated path involving numpy, which isn't relevant here)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK thank you I will do some research to quench my thirst for knowledge. :}</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you! do you know how to 'select' answer as the chosen answer? bearing in mind I only have 1 reputaion</span>
<span class="comment-copy">After 15 minutes u can click on the tick</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you I will</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@LeoCornelius No problem, good luck with the game!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the luck! :&gt;</span>
