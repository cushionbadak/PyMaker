<p>I am not familiar with how to export the list to the <code>csv</code> in python. Here is code for one list:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
X = ([1,2,3],[7,8,9])
Y = ([4,5,6],[3,4,5])
for x in range(0,2,1):
    csvfile = "C:/Temp/aaa.csv"
    with open(csvfile, "w") as output:
        writer = csv.writer(output, lineterminator='\n')
        for val in x[0]:
            writer.writerow([val])
</code></pre>
<p>And I want to the result:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kqiIN.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kqiIN.png"/></a> </p>
<p>Then how to modify the code(the main problem is how to change the column?)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To output multiple columns you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip()</code></a> like:</p>
<h3>Code:</h3>
<pre><code>import csv

x0 = [1, 2, 3]
y0 = [4, 5, 6]
x2 = [7, 8, 9]
y2 = [3, 4, 5]
csvfile = "aaa.csv"
with open(csvfile, "w") as output:
    writer = csv.writer(output, lineterminator='\n')
    writer.writerow(['x=0', None, None, 'x=2'])
    writer.writerow(['x', 'y', None, 'x', 'y'])
    for val in zip(x0, y0, [None] * len(x0), x2, y2):
        writer.writerow(val)
</code></pre>
<h3>Results:</h3>
<pre><code>x=0,,,x=2
x,y,,x,y
1,4,,7,3
2,5,,8,4
3,6,,9,5
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could try:</p>
<pre><code>with open('file.csv') as fin:
    reader = csv.reader(fin)
    [fout.write(r[0],r[1]) for r in reader]
</code></pre>

<p>When dealing with csv files you should really just use Pandas.  Put your header and data into a dataframe, and then use the .to_csv method on that dataframe.  Csv can get tricky when you have strings that contain commas, etc...</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, that works, but could we write this in a loop for x= 0,2...., i mean update writing the CSV file as loop runs</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The answer to your questions is YES.  But I do not understand your questions as to the specifics.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean when x=0, we write the first two columns(x0,y0) and when x=2, we add the next two columns(x2,y2) in the same CSV, etc. In your code, you already knew the number of columns.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But your variables are named <code>x0</code> and <code>x2</code>.  This is extremely bad practice if you want to iterate over them as a group.  How about using a <code>dict</code> so that you can properly iterate?  Other than that does this answer answer the question you asked?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok, I just change the code, could help me modify the code for loop?</span>
