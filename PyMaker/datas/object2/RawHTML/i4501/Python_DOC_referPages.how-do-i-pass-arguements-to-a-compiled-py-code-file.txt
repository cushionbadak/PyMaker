<pre><code>import ...
import ...

def function(parameter):
 ....

<p>See <a href="http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/</a> for a distutils extension that
  allows you to create console and GUI executables from Python code.
  py2exe, the most popular extension for building Python 2.x-based
  executables, does not yet support Python 3 but a version that does is
  in development.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you write Python code, you need to use Python. As an alternative, if you want to mix Python and C# code, you can use IronPython for .NET.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@vz0 But my script uses alot of librarys which are not supported by IronPython (Scikit-learn,pandas,Numpy)</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@JeruLuke That was already pointed out 10 seconds after my post (an hour ago), and I've since added information - is that not visible in Review?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@handle Haven't tried it yet but it seems like a very viable solution, thank you for the help and I'll update the question if it works out</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShkMo There is also the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/using/windows.html#embedded-distribution" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Embedded Distribution</a> that does not require installation, but installing additional library packages can be a bit trick. While it's not a single exe, it's a manageable number of (packed) files, that you could probably minimize for your needs to cut down on total size.</span>
