<p>Disclaimer: noob here. I am currently studying Python in college, and code not only at school, but for fun. I am currently writing a planet generating code (which I fully wrote in smallbasic language) and working it into Python language. I am running into a slight problem, due to the inexperience I have with Python, but this may be an easy one for you guys. Please tell me how exactly I can improve this segment of code so it works in the simplest way possible. Also, I want to point out that I want the user to enter a number between 1 and 12 planets to generate. Also, if the user just presses <code>ENTER</code>, enters a number outside the 1-12 number range, or enters anything other than a number, I'm wanting the program to just pick a random number. The code below works how I want it too, but it just looks sloppy and overkill...</p>
<pre><code>def num_planets():
    try:
        valid = ("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12")
        count = int(input("How many planets would you like to generate? "))
        if count != valid:
            import random
            count = random.randint(1,12)
            print("Given the invalid user input, the random valid integer,",count,"was selected.")
    except ValueError:
        import random
        count = random.randint(1,12)
        print("Given the invalid user input, the random valid integer,",count,"was selected.")

num_planets()

<p>First of all, I don't think it's working the way you expect it to because <code>count != valid</code> is comparing an <code>int</code> to a <code>tuple</code> of strings. So that condition will always be <code>True</code> (so your code will always generate a random value).</p>
<p>You need to convert <code>valid</code> into a <code>tuple</code> of ints, then use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>in</code> operation</a> to check if the <code>int</code> value is part of the <code>tuple</code>. </p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<pre><code>valid = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
count = int(input("How many planets would you like to generate? "))
if count not in valid:
    # use a random value
</code></pre>
<p>Second, to avoid repetition, you could place the randomizer code in a method.  </p>
<p>Like this:  </p>
<pre><code>def use_random_value():
    import random
    count = random.randint(1, 12)
    print("Given the invalid user input, the random valid integer,", count, "was selected.")


def num_planets():
    try:
        valid = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
        count = int(input("How many planets would you like to generate? "))
        if count not in valid:
            use_random_value()
    except ValueError:
        use_random_value()


num_planets()
</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, the <code>try/catch</code> for the <code>int(..)</code> is already "simple" enough as it follows the EAFP <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-eafp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">[1]</a><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11360858/what-is-the-eafp-principle-in-python">[2]</a> pattern. It will clearly try to convert the input value to an <code>int</code>, then you can just easily handle the error if that fails.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">correction* the code above does not work. It always says input is invalid even when I chose a number between 1 and 12</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked perfectly! Thank you Gino. I did not know you could include the NOT boolean logic into an IN operation. Now that I think of it, it makes sense:/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem :) By the way, I forgot to mention <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-eafp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">EAFP</a> as a coding style, which is implemented by that <code>try/catch</code> code.</span>
