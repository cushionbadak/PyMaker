<p>How can I create a tuple using a for in loop in python? I tried running the following:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = (i for i in range(15))
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
&lt;generator object &lt;genexpr&gt; at 0x00000198CAC95A40&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>But this gives a generator object instead of a tuple. Any ideas on how to get this? Not just needed to get the sequence of ints from 0 to 14 but other operations as well. </p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-tuple" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tuple()</code> constructor</a>:</p>
<pre><code>x = tuple(i for i in range(5))
assert x == (0,1,2,3,4)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't actually need the generator here at all; <code>tuple(range(5))</code> will work.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Apart from the empty tuple <code>()</code>, it is the <i>comma</i> that defines a tuple, not the parentheses that might surround the tuple literal.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chepner Yeah! I forgot about that. Parenthesis are also for expressions and in this case it's being treated like a statement. I now remember I had read about this some time ago when finding how to create a single element tuple. Like: <code>(1,)</code></span>
