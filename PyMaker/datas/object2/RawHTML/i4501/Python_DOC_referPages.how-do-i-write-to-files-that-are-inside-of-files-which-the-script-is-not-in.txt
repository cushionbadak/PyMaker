<p>I need to figure out how to fix this code:</p>
<pre><code>path = "/Folder/Test.txt"
with open(path,"r+") as f:
    line = f.readline()
print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>It needs to be able to write to the text document "Test.txt" in the folder named "Folder"</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First your path should be relative:</p>
<pre><code>path = "./Folder/Test.txt"
</code></pre>
<p>if you want to write to a file you need <code>"w"</code> instead of <code>"r"</code> in the open function</p>
<p>Read:</p>
<pre><code>with open(path, "r") as f:
    line = f.readline()
print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>Write:</p>
<pre><code>with open(path, "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello world!")
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>"w"</code> will replace all the current content of the file. If you want to append to the file instead, you should use <code>"a"</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>path</code> should be in <code>/absolute/location/of/file/filename</code>.</p>
<p>That means either <code>"C:/file/path/you/want/filename"</code> in Windows or <code>"/absolute/path/of/your/file/filename"</code> in *nix
You can also use relative paths if the path you want is nearby (shares a directory, etc.)</p>
<p>For example: if the script is in <code>/user/scripts</code> and you want to save in <code>/user/textfiles/Folder</code>, you can do <code>../textfiles/Folder</code></p>
<p>Also make sure that the folder exists, else, it will cause an error as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, as you go further in python, it is recommended that you check out the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os</a> module as it can help you a lot with file paths and other things</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the code doing that isn't correct? Is it giving an error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I wouldn't use path as a variable name, easy to confuse with <code>os.path</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The mode the OP used is fine. <code>"r+"</code> allows reading and writing of the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You did not answer his question.. He asked how to write to a file.</span>
