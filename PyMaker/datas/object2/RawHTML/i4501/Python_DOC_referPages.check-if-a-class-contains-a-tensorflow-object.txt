<p>I have a class from which different child classes are inherited. I use <code>pickle</code> to save/load class instances, but some child classes use <code>tensorflow</code>, for which a different method should be implemented.
How should I check to see if an object has a <code>tensorflow</code> attribute and how should I efficiently save/load objects to be able to construct the object?</p>

<p>You can use:</p>
<pre><code>hasattr(obj, 'tensorflow')
</code></pre>
<p>See the official <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hasattr" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>. </p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/saved_model" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tensorflow documentation</a> to see how you can save and load models.</p>
