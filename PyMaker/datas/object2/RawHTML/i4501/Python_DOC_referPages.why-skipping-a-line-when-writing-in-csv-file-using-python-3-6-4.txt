<p>I have this simple program in python 3.6.4 to write data in csv file when i open the file test.csv using excel 2010 i found the result written like that:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wHLNt.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wHLNt.png"/></a></p>
<p>this is the program:</p>
<pre><code>import csv   
lol = [(1,2,3),(4,5,6),(7,8,9)]
item_length = len(lol[0])

with open('test.csv', 'w') as test_file:
  file_writer = csv.writer(test_file)
  for i in range(item_length):
    file_writer.writerow([x[i] for x in lol])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Add <code>newline=''</code> to the <code>open()</code> parameters to prevent this</p>
<pre><code>with open('test.csv', 'w', newline='') as test_file:
    file_writer = csv.writer(test_file)
    for i in range(item_length):
        file_writer.writerow([x[i] for x in lol])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Solution is to specify the "lineterminator" parameter in the constructor</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">But do they actually exist in the CSV file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like Excel is using a different newline convention than what actually exists in the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no, the file is in w mode so it's new</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the file is empty there is nothing in the file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you very much it worked 100% with newline=''</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@YassinMohamadi You are welcome! Please accept my answer if it is what you are looking for</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@YassinMohamadi: The third line of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs for <code>csv.writer</code></a> (and <code>csv.reader</code> for that matter) makes this clear: "If csvfile is a file object, it should be opened with <code>newline=''</code>"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should show how to do this with code.</span>
