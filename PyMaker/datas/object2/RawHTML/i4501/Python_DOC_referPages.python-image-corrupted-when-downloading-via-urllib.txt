<p>How can I guess an image's mime type, in a cross-platform manner, and without any external libraries?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you know in advance that you only need to handle a limited number of file formats you can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/imghdr.html#imghdr.what">imghdr.what</a> function.</p>

<p>I've checked the popular image types' format on wikipedia, and tried to make a signature:</p>
<pre><code>def guess_image_mime_type(f):
    '''
    Function guesses an image mime type.
    Supported filetypes are JPG, BMP, PNG.
    '''
    with open(f, 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read(11)
    if data[:4] == '\xff\xd8\xff\xe0' and data[6:] == 'JFIF\0':
        return 'image/jpeg'
    elif data[1:4] == "PNG":
        return 'image/png'
    elif data[:2] == "BM":
        return 'image/x-ms-bmp'
    else:
        return 'image/unknown-type'
</code></pre>

<p>If you can rely on the file extension you can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/mimetypes.html#mimetypes.guess_type" rel="nofollow">mimetypes.guess_type</a> function. Note that you may get different results on different platforms, but I would still call it cross-platform.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why is not using external libraries a requirement?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Cause when your case is simple, there is no need to load heavy full-duty libraries if a small snippet can do the job.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">An external library might do it exactly the same way that you end up doing in your own code. By using a light-weight external library you avoid writing code and potentially introducing bugs. I can even imagine something based on a C library (such as libmagic) being faster and lighter than something written in plain Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Dind't know about <code>imghdr</code>. It's great.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead of looking up the signatures manually you could reimplement part of libmagic by parsing the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/5/magic" rel="nofollow noreferrer">magic file</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">As you said, it's useful if you can rely on the file extension. I used few web services lately that send you the raw image data without a filename, so it'd be useless in such cases.</span>
