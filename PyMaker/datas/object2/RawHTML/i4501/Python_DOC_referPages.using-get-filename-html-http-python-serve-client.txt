<p>Hopefully I can make this somewhat clear. I have to create a server and client in python that sends HTTP GET request to each other. Now I created a basic server/client program and now my goal is to send the server a HTTP GET request(from an html file I have saved) and the server to display the content.
Example Server would display something like
Date:
Content Length:
content Type:

As of now when I run the client and type GET / filename.html HTTP/1.1\n\r the server does not display. When I type that exact command in just a Linux shell it displays perfectly. How can I do this in a client and server. Hopefully this makes sense. Here is my client and server.</p>
<pre><code> #CLIENT
import socket
import sys

host = socket.gethostname()    
port = 12345                   # The same port as used by the server
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((host, port))
print(s.recv(1024))
inpt = input("type")
b = bytes(inpt, 'utf-8') #THIS SENDS BUT SERVER DOESDNT RECIEVE
s.sendall(b)
print("Message Sent")
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<pre><code>#SERVERimport socket
import sys
host = ''        # Symbolic name meaning all available interfaces
port = 12345     # Arbitrary non-privileged port
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind((host, port))
s.listen(5)
while True:
  c, addr = s.accept()
  print("Connection accepted from " + repr(addr[1]))
  c.send(b"Server Approved")
  print(repr(addr[1]) + ":" + c.recv(1024).decode("UTF-8"))
  c.close()
</code></pre>
<p>I want to type something like this to my server and display its content<br/>
GET / google.com HTTP/1.1\r\n</p>

<p>The error message is so straightforward, just read it to fix the code that doesn't work.</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
print(repr(addr[1]) + ":" + c.recv(1024))
TypeError: must be str, not bytes   
</code></pre>
<p>Add <code>.decode("utf-8")</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print(repr(addr[1]) + ":" + c.recv(1024).decode("utf-8"))
</code></pre>
<p>And more clear is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str()</code></a> instead of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>repr()</code></a>. You can read about the differences between these two here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1436703/difference-between-str-and-repr-in-python">Difference between __str__ and __repr__ in Python</a>.</p>
<pre><code>print(str(addr[1]) + ":" + c.recv(1024).decode("utf-8"))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Even with the .decode imputed I'm still getting TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My bad, addr[1] is an <code>int</code> so either <code>str()</code> or <code>repr()</code> is necessary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm both still don't seem to work. But thank you for the .decode portion it makes sense to change the byte into a string</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please update the question with the error or/and description of the problem you have right now, so I can help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just updated code and displayed the HTTP GET method I want to type in and display</span>
