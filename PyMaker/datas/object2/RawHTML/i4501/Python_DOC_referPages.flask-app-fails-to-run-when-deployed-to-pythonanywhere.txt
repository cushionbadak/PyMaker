<p>I'm working on a web app that makes calls to the movie database. Everything runs fine when it's running on localhost. I'm attempting to deploy it on pythonanywhere. I have created a virtual environment and installed all the dependencies. I believe I have edited the WSGI file correctly. </p>
<pre><code>import sys
path = '/home/gcmatt/capstone/src'
if path not in sys.path
   sys.path.append(path)
from app import app as application
</code></pre>
<p>At least from the error messages I get it appears to have found the files.
When I try to load the page it fails to run. It appears that for some reason the code won't import my own functions src.models.search.   </p>

<p>Do I need to alter the file structure or file paths in the python code for the app to run? I followed the tutorials on python anywhere and feel that I have set everything up correctly. </p>
<p>This is what my directory structure looks like</p>
<pre><code>capstone/
|--.git/
|--src/
   |models/
    |--__init__.py
    |--results.py
    |--search.py
  |--templates

    |--home.html
    |--noresults.html
    |--search.html
  |--__init__.py
  |--api_file.txt
  |--app.py
  |--requirements.txt

<p>Since you set your <code>path = '/home/gcmatt/capstone/src'</code>, the <code>src</code> module is not available on <code>path</code>. Only <code>models</code>, <code>templates</code> etc are. </p>
<p>Python is only going to recognize a package if it can see a <strong>subdirectory</strong> with an <code>__init__.py</code> in it. It will <strong>not</strong> recognize the current directory as a package, regardless of whether the current directory has <code>__init__.py</code> or not.</p>
<p>Try setting <code>path = '/home/gcmatt/capstone'</code> and it should be able to detect the package <code>src</code>. </p>
<p>Edit here: you may also want to say <code>from src.app import app as application</code></p>
<p>Second edit here: In your <code>app.py</code> you should also change your imports to import subpackages instead of <code>src.[something]</code>. For instance: <code>from models.search import Search</code>. Your WSGI will see the package <code>src</code>, and import <code>src.app</code> from it. And then <code>src.app</code> imports packages relative to itself (i.e. <code>import models</code>). </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you post your directory structure as well</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you should rename <code>app.py</code> by something else, e.g. <code>myapp.py</code> because later you are importing the variable <code>app</code> which has the same name. I also had <code>from app import app as application</code> in my wsgi file and it was leading to issues until I renamed it...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried both of your suggestions. Unfortunately, I'm still receiving the same error messages.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What are the imports you have in app.py?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>from flask import Flask, render_template, request</code> <code>from wtforms import Form, StringField, validators</code> <code>from src.models.search import Search</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">After making those changes that @GabrielBoorse suggested, are you still seeing the same errors?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I'm still experiencing the same errors. It doesn't import src.models.search.</span>
