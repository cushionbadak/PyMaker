<p>Say I have the following code:</p>
<pre><code>def func(a,b):
    return (func2(a),func3(3))

def paralel_func(alist,blist)
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=None) as executor:
        executor.map(func,alist,blist)
</code></pre>
<p>How do I access the return values that were returned from <code>func</code> ? I tried to figure it out myself by thinking that <code>executor.map</code> is a list that holds the values but that didnt work for me. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>May be you should try this</p>
<pre><code>ablists = [alist, blist]

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
    future_list= {executor.submit(func, a, b): i for i in ablists}
</code></pre>
<p>You can read more here about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">futures</a> and also executors</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Where is func2?It is not clear what you really want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">func2 and func3 are arbitrary non-parallel functions, that return a value which I'd like to access after I have done my computations</span>
<span class="comment-copy">wouldnt I have to loop over <code>alist</code> and <code>blist</code> to submit the futures ?</span>
