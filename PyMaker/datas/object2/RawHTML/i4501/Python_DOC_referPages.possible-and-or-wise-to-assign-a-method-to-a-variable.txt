<p>I'm repeatedly trying to get similar data from time series dataframes. For example, the monthly (annualized) standard deviation of the series:</p>
<pre><code>any_df.resample('M').std().mean()*12**(1/2)
</code></pre>
<p>It would save typing and would probably limit errors if these methods could be assigned to a variable, so they can be re-used - I guess this would look something like</p>
<pre><code>my_stdev = .resample('M').std().mean()*12**(1/2)
result = any_df.my_stdev()
</code></pre>
<p>Is this possible and if so is it sensible?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Why not just make your own function?</p>
<pre><code>def my_stdev(df):
    return df.resample('M').std().mean()*12**(1/2)

result = my_stdev(any_df)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">First, that's not a method. Second, you need to go through a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">basic Python tutorial</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">learn to write a function</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks - that does indeed work. I don't know why that didn't occur to me.</span>
