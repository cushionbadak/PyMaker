<p>I would like to open a file dialog with easygui but the path contains a folder with a <code>.</code>: <code>C:\Users\user\.atom</code></p>
<pre><code>myfile= easygui.fileopenbox(msg="Choose a file", default=r"C:\Users\user\.atom")
</code></pre>
<p>This opens the dialog box to <code>C:\Users\user</code> not <code>C:\Users\user\.atom</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I didn't / don't use <em>easygui</em>, just looked at the source code.</p>
<p><em>easygui</em> does some path processing on the <code>default</code> argument. That processing involves <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">[Python]: os.path.<strong>split</strong>(<em>path</em>)</a> which splits the path in 2 parts (what comes before and after the last path separator (<em>bkslash</em> or "<em>\</em>")). <br/>
Since "<em>.atom</em>" comes after the last "<em>\</em>", it's not considered as part of the path (the fact that it contains a "<em>.</em>" is just a coincidence and has nothing to do with it).</p>
<p>To fix your problem, add a wildcard to your path, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>myfile = easygui.fileopenbox(msg="Choose a file", default=r"C:\Users\user\.atom\*")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Sorry for the confusion between  ".credentials" and ".atom", it was  really ".atom". Thanks a lot for the detailed explanation!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No worries, it's not like it was creating a confusion. It's the same principle no matter what the dir name would be.</span>
