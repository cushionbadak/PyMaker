<p>You may try this regex which is same with yours except that this includes an inline modifier, <code>(?s)</code> ( <code>Single-line</code> or <code>Dot-all modifier</code> which enables dot(.) indicate all characters including vertical white spaces , newline(<code>[\n\r]</code>), etc so that enables manipulating multiple lines texts as like single line string.)</p>

<p>Additionally, you can set the <code>Dot-all</code>(or <code>single-line</code>) modifier through python <code>re</code> module's functions flag <code>re.S</code> like follows</p>
<pre><code>pattern= re.compile(r"JOB RESPONSIBILITIES: .*",re.S)

<span class="comment-copy">Dot, by default, does not match new lines. You'll have to use the <code>re.DOTALL</code> modifier if you want such behavior, i.e. <code>pattern = re.compile(r"REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:  .*", re.DOTALL)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zwer  i tried using pattern = re.compile(r"REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS: .*", re.DOTALL) but the output is not extracting the whole value its only taking match='REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:  \r\n- Degree in environ&gt;</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank You for this alternative way @Ayodhyankit Paul appreciate it!</span>
