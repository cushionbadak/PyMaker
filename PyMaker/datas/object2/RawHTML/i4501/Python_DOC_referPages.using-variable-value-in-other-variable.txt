<p>I have a variable such as:</p>
<pre><code>x = 'HELLO'
</code></pre>
<p>I want to access a DIC using the following string</p>
<pre><code>self.dname.x[0]
</code></pre>
<p>which inherenlty should mean</p>
<pre><code>self.dname.HELLO[0]
</code></pre>
<p>what is the proper way to do this in python?  What is the proper term for this type of variable? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming <code>self.dname</code> is a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>self.dname[x][0]
</code></pre>
<p><code>x</code> is an "index" variable - you are using it to find the data you want.  Here's a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/2352181/2877364">related question</a> going the other way.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> (tested in Python 2 and 3)</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo={'HELLO': [1,2,3]}
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo
{'HELLO': [1, 2, 3]}
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.HELLO[0]                          &lt;--- doesn't work
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'HELLO'
&gt;&gt;&gt; x='HELLO'
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo[x][0]                             &lt;--- works fine

</code></pre>
<p>You asked about <code>self.x</code>.  If <code>x</code> is a regular variable, you don't reference it with <code>self.</code> (as in the example above).  If <code>x</code> is a member of your class, then yes, you will need to use <code>self.x</code>.  However, if you are carrying around a key and a dictionary, you might consider redesigning your data structures to carry the resulting value instead.</p>

<p>I'm not sure to understand the question, but you might want to have a look at the <code>getattr</code> builtin function (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr</a>).</p>
<p>For example, in your case (again, if I understand correctly) :</p>
<pre><code>x = 'HELLO'
getattr(self.dname, x)[0]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">We need more information. What is the type of dname?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe the OP's usage of "DIC" is short for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionary</a> @KevinMGranger.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't agree. I think it means <a href="http://php-di.org/doc/understanding-di.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dependency Injection Container</a> (php link but still applicable).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@blonc we need a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks cxw - q: it seems that if self.x = 'HELLO' that means i also always need to add self.x with in the [self.x] is that proper?  seems like a lot of extra work to add self every place.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@blonc Updated - let me know if this answers your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If x is a member of your class (self refers to the instance of that class), then yes, you will need to do that. Your given example doesn't show that, however.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Was directed at blonc. Forgot to throw a tag in there.</span>
