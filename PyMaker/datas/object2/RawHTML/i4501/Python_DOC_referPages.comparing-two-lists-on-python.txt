<p>I need help comparing two lists and returning the indices that they don't match.</p>
<pre><code>a = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
b = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
</code></pre>
<p>indices 4 and 8 don't match and i need to return that as a list <code>[4,8]</code></p>
<p>I've tried a few methods but they haven't worked for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> to iterate over both lists at the same time and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> to get the indices during iteration, and write a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a> that filters out the indices where the list values  don't match:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [i for i, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(a, b)) if x != y]
[4, 8]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could also just use a simple loop which scans the lists, item by item:</p>
<pre><code>a = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
b = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

diff=[]

for i in range(0,len(a)):
    if a[i]!=b[i]:
        diff.append(i)

print diff
</code></pre>
<p>A list comprehension could also do the same thing:</p>
<pre><code>diff=[i for i in range(len(a)) if a[i]!=b[i]]
print diff
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are happy to use a 3rd party library, <code>numpy</code> provides one way:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

a = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1])
b = np.array([0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0])

res = np.where(a != b)[0]

# array([4, 8], dtype=int64)

<p>You can use zip :</p>
<pre><code>a = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
b = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

    count+=1

print(indices)

<span class="comment-copy">That will certainly help, but that's not a duplicate, OP wants the indexes not the values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">PO = [i for i, (x, y) in enumerate(zip(lst1, lst2)) if x!= y]       return PO           This always returns [0] as my result despite the lists having obvious differences</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@dfairch I'm 99.999% sure that this code works correctly. Could you share the two lists you're comparing? (But to be honest I think it's more likely that there's a bug hiding somewhere else in your program.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">lst1 = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]      lst2=[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@dfairch That gives <code>[4, 8]</code> as it should. Really, there must be a bug somewhere in your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>range(0,len(a))</code> could be simplified to just <code>range(len(a))</code></span>
