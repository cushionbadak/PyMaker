<p>I'm accessing one function from dll which need file pointer (char *filename).  How can I pass it through python?</p>
<pre><code>handle = cdll.dsp

p = open("signal.txt", "r")

handle.filter(p)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A file pointer is <code>FILE *</code>. But you mentioned you need <code>char *filename</code>, which is a char pointer (i.e. a null-terminated string). I'm going to assume the C function has a prototype <code>void filter(char *filename)</code>.</p>
<p>First you must <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#specifying-the-required-argument-types-function-prototypes" rel="nofollow">define the function argument types and the return type</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import ctypes
filter = ctypes.cdll.dsp.filter
filter.argtypes = (ctypes.c_char_p,)
filter.restype = None  # Or whatever type it returns.
</code></pre>
<p>Then you call it:</p>
<pre><code>filter("signal.txt")
</code></pre>
<p>By the way, you tagged your question as Python 2.7, but nowadays you should move on to Python 3, unless you have a really good reason to stay at the older version.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi, Abrams, So according to you what is the meaning of char* filename If I'm wrong, please let me know</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Uh... it sounds like a string containing a filename to me...</span>
