<p>The temp directory in win 7 is <code>%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp</code> and I'd like to add it to a python script as a variable to be used to create a text file there. </p>
<p>However, because of the <code>%</code> at the beginning, it makes python unable to identify it. I tried to add double <code>%%</code>, but that didn't work as well.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>

<p>You should use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html" rel="nofollow"><code>tempfile</code></a> module instead:</p>
<pre><code>import tempfile
my_temp = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()
</code></pre>
<p>This is the platform-independent way to have a temporary file.  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">The problem with tempfile module is that the file gets deleted once closed  <code>fp.close()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can make it like <code>tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)</code></span>
