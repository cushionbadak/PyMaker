<p>I am trying to install <a href="http://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/setup-production.html" rel="nofollow">Taiga</a> on my computer, and for one of the scripts its trying to <code>import suppress</code> but failing. I tried doing this manually:</p>
<pre><code>(taiga)$ python
Python 3.3.3 (default, Nov 27 2013, 17:12:35) 
[GCC 4.8.2] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from contextlib import suppress
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ImportError: cannot import name suppress
</code></pre>
<p>Could someone please help?</p>

<p>According to the <a href="http://taigaio.github.io/taiga-doc/dist/" rel="nofollow">documentation for Taiga</a>, among the requirements is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Python 3.4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, you should not expect it to work in Python 3.3.</p>
<p>And that's exactly your problem here. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.suppress" rel="nofollow"><code>contextlib.suppress</code></a> function is "New in version 3.4."</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.suppress" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>contextlib.suppress</code></a> requires Python 3.4 or later. So, either Taiga requires Python 3.4 or later (which should be documented), or it's got a bug.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah ok, I was hoping that wouldn't be the case. I will now need to hack LMDE to force a <code>python</code> upgrade. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@codehitman: I thought the whole point of LMDE was to include Debian packages that haven't made it into normal Mint yet? Does it really not have a Python 3.4 package?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nope :( Getting tired of hacking linux just to get something running at this point. If I wasn't on a student budget I'd buy a Mac.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nope, building from source- faster!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@codehitman: Even with no budget, why not use a more popular distro like Ubuntu or Fedora instead of a minor/specialist fork of a smaller distro?</span>
