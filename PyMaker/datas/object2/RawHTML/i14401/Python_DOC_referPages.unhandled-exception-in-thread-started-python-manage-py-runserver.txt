<p>Recently I installed Python 3.4.3 in my environment (Windows 8.1) and tried to deploy a simple Django server. When I runned the command <code>python manage.py runserver</code> but the following exceptions appeared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unhandled exception in thread started by .wrapper at 0x031B5D68&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this exception happened due some error or misconception when I tried to install <code>mysql-python</code>. I changed the <code>DATABASE</code> config in <code>settings.py</code> from "django.db.backends.mysql" to "django.db.backends.sqlite3" and runned pretty well. The configs that I tried are the following:</p>
<pre><code># Defective configuration
DATABASES = {
  'default': {
    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
    'NAME': 'test',
    'USER': 'user',
    'PASSWORD': 'doideira',
    'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
    'PORT': '3306',
  } 
}
</code></pre>
<p>But using SQLite works:</p>
<pre><code># With SQLite 3 works
DATABASES = {
  'default': {
    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
     'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I am experiencing some troubles and any advice would be appreciated. I would like to know why this is happening and how can I workaround it.</p>
<p>Further info:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mysql version is 5.6.4</li>
<li>Mysql Python version is 1.2.5</li>
<li>Python version is 1.2.5</li>
<li>Windows 8.1</li>
<li>Django version is 1.8.1</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update</strong> <em>Saturday 16, May 2015</em>:</p>
<p>I came up with an simple solution: downgrade Python from 3.x to 2.7.x. I explain the steps below as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/30280316/3147039">the answer of my question</a>. I also found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/23376193/3147039">this answer</a> very useful, but now that I'm using Python 2.7 everything is ok.</p>
<p>I also found this article that answers the question "<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Should I use Python 2 or Python 3 for my development activity</a>" and that was what made me to decide whether keep with Python3 or Python2. Since Python3 hasn't a strong library support, I will wait a little more until update it.</p>

<p>For Python 3 we need to install mysqlclient and PyMySQL</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Eureka! I figured out the answer guys.</p>
<p>As @nikhiln mentioned in the comments, mysql-python is not supported yet for Python 3.x:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MySQL-3.23 through 5.5 and Python-2.4 through 2.7 are currently supported. Python-3.0 will be supported in a future release. PyPy is supported.
  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.5" rel="nofollow">mysql-python 1.2.5</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To work around it, I downgraded my Python from 3.4 to 2.7.9, and installed the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64)</a> to properly run it.</p>
<p>Then I installed the mysql-python client using a <em>.whl</em> file from <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#mysql-python" rel="nofollow">Christoph Gohlke`s Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages</a>. I did as following (assuming C++ 2008, Compiler for Python and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/" rel="nofollow">Pip</a> are already installed):</p>
<ol>
<li><code>pip install wheel</code> to install the wheel program. With it you are able to compile <em>.whl</em> files.</li>
<li>Download the properly file <em>MySQL_python‑1.2.5‑cp27‑none‑...</em></li>
<li>Run the command <code>pip install MySQL_python‑1.2.5‑cp27‑none‑...whl</code> (the file you downloaded in the previous step).</li>
</ol>
<p>And <em>Voilà</em>! mysql-python is running swiftly now!
To check if everything is ok, just run <code>import MySQLdb</code> into Python shell.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import MySQLdb
</code></pre>
<p>If no exception was raised, then the work is done.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I believe Mysql Python is not compatible with python 3.x yet. Check documentation here: <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.5" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.5</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's right @nikhiln. It seems that Python 3.x is not supported yet. I just need to downgrade Python a little bit and run some scripts. Thanks for the hint.</span>
