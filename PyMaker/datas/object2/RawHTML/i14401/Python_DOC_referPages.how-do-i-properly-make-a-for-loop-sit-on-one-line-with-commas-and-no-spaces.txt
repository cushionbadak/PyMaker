<p>I'm new to coding and it's a little frustrating at the moment because i have to do an assessment where it outputs "1,2,fizz,4,buzz,fizz,7,8,fizz,buzz,11,fizz,13,14,fizzbuzz,16,17,fizz,19,buzz" and no i cant use print.</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
num1=int(input('Enter your number range: '))
for x in range(1,num1+1):
   if x % 3 == 0:
      print("Fizz",end=" ")
   if x % 5 == 0:
      print('Buzz',end=" ")
   if x % 3 != 0 and x % 5 != 0:
      print(str(x),end=" ")
</code></pre>
<p>Result: "enter your number range?"(well say 20)</p>
<pre><code>1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 Fizz Buzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz 
</code></pre>
<p>so as you can see its on the same line but i don't want spaces, and i want commas in between each number and letter accept where number 15 should be, i want that to one word "FizzBuzz", as seen on the example : </p>
<pre><code>1,2,fizz,4,buzz,fizz,7,8,fizz,buzz,11,fizz,13,14,fizzbuzz,16,17,fizz,19,buzz
</code></pre>

<p>This is basically the same question I have answered <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29667312/3635816">here</a>. If you look at the documentation for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer">print</a>, it says you print a variable number of objects (<code>*objects</code> in the docs). <code>print</code> takes a <code>sep</code> keyword, which is the character(s) you want to separate your printed objects with. </p>
<p>If you modify you code slightly to collect the items-to-be-printed in a list first and then print all at once:</p>
<pre><code>num1=int(input('Enter your number range: '))
items = list()
for x in range(1,num1+1):
    if x % 3 == 0:
        items.append("Fizz")
    if x % 5 == 0:
        items.append('Buzz')
    if x % 3 != 0 and x % 5 != 0:
        items.append(str(x))

print(*items, sep=',')
</code></pre>
<p>When you run it:</p>
<pre><code>Enter your number range: 10
1,2,Fizz,4,Buzz,Fizz,7,8,Fizz,Buzz
</code></pre>
<p>For the <code>*objects</code>-syntax you can take a look at this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/3394835/3635816">SO-question</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>To account for numbers evenly divisible with both 3 and 5:</p>
<pre><code>num1=int(input('Enter your number range: '))
items = list()
for x in range(1,num1+1):
    if x % 5 == 0 and x % 3 == 0:
        items.append('FizzBuzz')
    elif x % 3 == 0:
        items.append("Fizz")
    elif x % 5 == 0:
        items.append('Buzz')
    else:
        items.append(str(x))

print(*items, sep=',')
</code></pre>

<p>Don't use print for formating, but simply join the different string elements.
Enter this in the interpreter:</p>
<pre><code>','.join([     'FizzBuzz' if not(i%15) 
          else 'Fizz'     if not(i%3)
          else 'Buzz'     if not(i%5)
          else str(i)
          for i in range(1,a+1)
         ])
</code></pre>
<p>or put the above line inside a print statement</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You cannot use print? You mean that You cannot just print this string or You cannot use it anywhere in Your program?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK, I think you're almost there. What does <code>end=" "</code> do in your <code>print</code> calls? What test can you do to see if you should be printing "FizzBuzz" as one word?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When i use end="", it pulls the line bellow it up so instead of displaying on different lines it brings it up to the same line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, so instead of each string you print ending with a newline (<code>\n</code>), it ends with a space. Can you see how to use that to get commas instead of spaces between your values?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i found one way but it futs a comma between every word and number, which is party what i want but i need number 15 to be the full word "FizzBuzz", also i still have spaces in-between my words and numbers</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you, its very close now i just need to figure out how to get that pesky number 15 to be one word not two, because multiple of 3 are "Fizz" . With multiples of 5 are "Buzz".  If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 then its "FizzBuzz".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Added, see edit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks everyone for your contribution, now it;s working %100. can i just ask what (in line 3) "(1,num1+1)" the first 1 does to the code?</span>
