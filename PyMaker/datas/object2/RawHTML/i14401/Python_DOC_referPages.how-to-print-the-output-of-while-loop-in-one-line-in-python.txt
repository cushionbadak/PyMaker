<p>It is a program to take input from user and print that iput in one line.
when the user gives input 1,2,3,4
the output that is every number come out in different line.</p>
<p>that is after each iteration of loop output comes in new line but i want output to be in single line.How can i do it?
but i want output
1 2 3 4 5 
how to get that output</p>
<pre><code>print("Program to print a 1d array")
array=[]
i=0
j=0
while(i&lt;5):               ##whileloop1
    item=int(input())
    array.append(item)
    i=i+1
while(j&lt;5):              ##whileloop2
    print(array[j])
    j=j+1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>join</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print("Program to print a 1d array")
array = [int(input()) for _ in range(5)]
print(' '.join(map(str, array)))
</code></pre>

<p>As @Bo102010 said, "In Python 3: <code>print(array[j], end=' ')</code>". But alternatively python supports printing lists as is. <code>print(list)</code> ,or in you case, <code>print(array)</code> will print out an array on one line.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Should your second while loop be indented so it's inside the first?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ohruunuruus no that would throw an out of bounds exception</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JGerulskis looking more closely I see what's going on. I thought nested while loops were used to print an array</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As a side note, this is not a good way to loop over a list. Just do <code>for item in array:</code>. And for the first loop, <code>for j in range(5):</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">up voted because of the improvement on OP code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why the downvote? Aren't we allowed to offer perfectly valid better solutions to the problem the OP actually is trying to solve? If <i>I</i> were asking such a question, I'd be happy to be told I'm doing it wrong and be shown a better way.</span>
