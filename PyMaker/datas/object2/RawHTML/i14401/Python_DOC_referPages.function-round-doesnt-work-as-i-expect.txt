<p>I am trying to use round function here. Sometimes it round down from <code>.5</code> sometimes round up. So what's the problem?</p>
<p>Source file:</p>
<pre><code>print("rounding up 0.5 is",round(.5))
print("rounding up 1.5 is",round(1.5))
print("rounding up 2.5 is",round(2.5))
print("rounding up 3.5 is",round(3.5))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>rounding up 0.5 is 0
rounding up 1.5 is 2
rounding up 2.5 is 2
rounding up 3.5 is 4
</code></pre>

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when you say <code>rounding up</code>, it's not necessarily rounding up. It's just rounding.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is python3 I suppose? Because it works fine for python2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Round-.5-to-even-digit is standard in many fields of math, especially statistics, so it's often the standard in many programming languages as well.</span>
