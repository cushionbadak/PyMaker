<p>I need Python code that takes a number input as a string and <strong>detects</strong> if it is binary, decimal or hexadecimal. </p>
<p>Also, I want to <strong>convert</strong> it to other two types <strong>without</strong> using bin(),dec(),hex(),int() commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>if my_num[0:2] == "0x" or my_num[0] == "x":print "hex"
elif my_num[0:2] == "0b" or my_num[0] == "b" and all(x in "01" for x in my_num):print "bin"
elif my_num[0] in "0O": print "oct"
elif re.match("^[0-9]+$",my_num): print "dec"
else: print "I dont know i guess its just a string ... or maybe base64"
</code></pre>
<p>is a way ... </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This will tell you if an input string is bin, dec or hex</p>
<p>NOTE : As per steffano's comment, you will have to write something more to classify a number like 10 - which can be bin/dec/hex. Only one of the below functions should evaluate to true, otherwise you are wrong. Try to put this check.</p>
<pre><code>import re

def isBinary(strNum):
    keyword = "^[0-1]*$"
    re.compile(keyword)
    if(re.match(keyword, strNum)) :
        return True
    else : 
        return False

def isDecimal(strNum):
    keyword = "^[0-9]*$"
    re.compile(keyword)
    if(re.match(keyword, strNum)) :
        return True
    else : 
        return False

def isHexa(strNum):
    keyword = "^[0-9a-fA-f]*$"
    re.compile(keyword)
    if(re.match(keyword, strNum)) :
        return True
    else : 
        return False
#Tests
print isHexa("AAD");
print isDecimal("11B")
print isBinary("0110a")
</code></pre>
<p>Output of this : </p>
<pre><code>True
False
False
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Is that a sort of learning task?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">consider doing checks with regular expressions? for hex its going to be {0-9,A-F}, for bin {0,1} &amp; for dec {0,9}.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"without using bin(),dec(),hex()" So, using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.format</code></a> is okay?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am trying a sample type checker with regex .. will that be okay?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is impossible. What are you going to do with input "10"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">again the number "10" is a problem here too</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no its not ... 10 is a decimal... b10 or 0b10 would be binary x10 or 0x10 would be hex; 010 or O10 would be octal</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes thats right. this works for number input only, correct?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">he never said it could only accept 0-9a-f ... <code>I need a python code that understands the type of the input whether it is binary, decimal or hexadecimal</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes thats right !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To clarify: I wasn't talking about your answer, I was talking about the question. Your answer is wrong and very bad for other reasons.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StefanPochmann - can you please elaborate some of the things you think may be wrong / bad here. I would like to make an effort to correct it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry, there's just way too much bad stuff to list it all, but start with trying <code>isHexa("Ax")</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StefanPochmann - yes you are right. I will take this answer down in 1hour, if i cannot fix this. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fixed the isHexa("Ax") now, it works. I need to add another check for "10" - this is tricky</span>
