<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was trying to follow an exercise by the book "Python for the absolute beginner" and I kept getting an infinite loop no matter what I did. I googled the answer to see if someone got it and I tried this code: <a href="http://pastebin.com/snnuvBLf" rel="nofollow">http://pastebin.com/snnuvBLf</a> only to find out that it wasn't working either. </p>
<p>After a while of trying I decided to enter the numbers the program requested in between quotation marks, and it did work. Any reason why this is happening? Is the code, or that I am doing something wrong. or the compiler itself? I am so confused.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The reason adding the quotation marks ("") around all your numbers works is because choice is being evaluated as a string rather than an int.</p>
<p>so when you use</p>
<pre><code>choice = input("Choose option.")
</code></pre>
<p>Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">evaluates this as a string</a> (and adding the quotes allows all your if statements and while statements to also evaluate as strings). Instead of having to evaluate everything as a string you can just cast the input to int when its entered with:</p>
<pre><code>choice = int(input("Choose option."))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Oh I see, I didn't know that Python 3 assumed all inputs were strings. I am using Python 2.7. What I did is that I changed all the input sintax to raw_input and it worked. Thanks for your help.</span>
