<p>Currently, whenever I need to parse a query string,  I was originally doing</p>
<pre><code> from urllib import parse

 path = parse.urlparse(self.path)
 query = parse.parse_qs(path.query)

 value = query[name][0]
</code></pre>
<p>But I didn't like the <code>[0]</code>s dotted around my code - it felt <em>wrong</em> in some hard to pinpoint way, so I realised I could do</p>
<pre><code> from urllib import parse

 path = parse.urlparse(self.path)
 query = dict(parse.parse_qsl(path.query))

 value = query[name]
</code></pre>
<p>That has the advantage of removing the <code>[0]</code>'s, but it risks discarding multiple values (which should be fine for my application, which shouldn't be receiving multiple values anyway).</p>
<p>Is there a cleaner way of parsing urlencoded strings, that gives you a <code>dict</code> of minimal values: the value if there's only one value, or a list if there's multiple?</p>
<p>A function to do so shouldn't be too difficult, but I'm curious if there's a library that does this so I don't need to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In general, if you have such a dictionary <code>query</code>, you could always do</p>
<pre><code>query = {[(k, v[0] if len(v) == 1 else v) for k, v in query.iteritems()]}
</code></pre>
<p>However, I really dislike this code, as it just produces stuff that is unintuitive later on.</p>
