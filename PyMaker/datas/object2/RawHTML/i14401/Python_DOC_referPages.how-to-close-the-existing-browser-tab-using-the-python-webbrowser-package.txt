<p>Using Python webbrowser package I can open a new tab with a specified URL. Is there a way to close this tab? I referred the below official docs and nothing related to close action is mentioned. </p>

<p>No, webbrowser doesn't have methods to close tabs nor browser itself as you may see in its documentation page:

<p><strong>You could</strong></p>
<p>Use a hotkey using the <code>pykeyboard</code> library which you can read about at <a href="https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/SavinaRoja/PyUserInput</a></p>
<p><strong>Another (but probably worse) option is:</strong></p>
<p>You may use a "taskkill" command like</p>
<pre><code>import os    
os.system("taskkill /im chrome.exe /f")
</code></pre>
<p>However, this will just kill all processes and close the chosen program (in this case chrome.exe)</p>
<p>(This also may delete data from the browser, f.eks. you lose all you're windows even tho you have chosen in settings to save them for next time you open your browser)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The webbrowser package cannot directly interact with your browser. It only uses OS functionality to open an URL, which works exactly the same way as if you click on a link in a third party program, e.g. an office or PDF document. There is simply no equivalent functionality to <i>close</i> a tab (that would be a bad idea for many reasons - you want acrobat or office to be able to open a tab, but not to be able to close random tabs), so the answer to your question is that it's not possible.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for such a clear explanation. Is there a way to close an active tab in chrome browser using python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@l4mpi: IMHO that should have been an answer instead of a comment. :-)</span>
