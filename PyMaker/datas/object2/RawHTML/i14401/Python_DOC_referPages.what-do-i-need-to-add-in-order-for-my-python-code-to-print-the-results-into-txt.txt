<p>Could somebody of you please help me in my endeavour to succesfully complete this reverse-engineering quest of mine ? I just need a pattern and a correct solution and I'll be off to finish this with class :D
Here's my code: </p>
<pre><code>print("Welcome...")

l = int(input("Specify length [m]: "))

if l &lt; 0:
    print("You've entered a wrong index.Please specify.")
    l = int(input("Specify length [m]: "))

if l == 0:
    print("You've entered a wrong index.Please specify.")
    l = int(input("Specify length [m]: "))

print("Calculation...") 

P = float(input("Force P [kN]: "))
A = P
B = P

if P &gt; 0:
    print("Result A je ", P, "kN")
    print("Result B je ", P, "kN")
    print("Calculation...")

    maxM = (P*l)/3
    print("Maximum value", maxM, "kNm")
if P &lt; 0:
    print("You've entered an invalid argument.Please specify.")
    P = float(input("Force P [kN]: "))
    print("Result A je ", P, "kN")
    print("Result B je ", P, "kN")

    print("Calculation...")

    maxM = (P*l)/3
    print("Maximum result : ", maxM, "kNm")

<p>First, to write to a file, you have to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow"><code>open</code></a> it.</p>
<p>Next, to write to a file instead of printing to the console, you need the <code>file</code> keyword argument on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print</code></a> function.</p>
<p>And finally, you have to make sure you <code>close</code> the file, so the output gets written to disk instead of sitting around in a buffer. The easiest way to do that is to use a <code>with</code> statement.</p>
<p>This is all explained in more detail in the tutorial under <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow">Reading and Writing Files</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure which parts of this you want to write to the file and which you want to write to the terminal, so I'll take a guess; you can adjust as needed:</p>
<pre><code>print("Welcome...")

l = int(input("Specify length [m]: "))

if l &lt; 0:
    print("You've entered a wrong index.Please specify.")
    l = int(input("Specify length [m]: "))

if l == 0:
    print("You've entered a wrong index.Please specify.")
    l = int(input("Specify length [m]: "))

print("Calculation...") 

P = float(input("Force P [kN]: "))
A = P
B = P

with open('output.txt', 'w') as outfile:

    if P &gt; 0:
        print("Result A je ", P, "kN", file=outfile)
        print("Result B je ", P, "kN", file=outfile)
        print("Calculation...")

        maxM = (P*l)/3
        print("Maximum value", maxM, "kNm", file=outfile)
    if P &lt; 0:
        print("You've entered an invalid argument.Please specify.")
        P = float(input("Force P [kN]: "))
        print("Result A je ", P, "kN", file=outfile)
        print("Result B je ", P, "kN", file=outfile)

        print("Calculation...")

        maxM = (P*l)/3
        print("Maximum result : ", maxM, "kNm", file=outfile)

<span class="comment-copy">Are you just asking for the <code>file</code> keyword parameter to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print</code></a> function? Or is there something more you don't understand?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, what I don't understand is .. what do I need to change in my code, for it to output the result into a .txt file (entry values are in another .txt file).It's just your basic reading/writing, but it seems I can't wrap my head around it.I just need an example based on my code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, yes, first I need to open an empty .txt file.... for e.g.: dat = open("results", "w") .. .. the next step is to add a parameter into individual results for them to appear in my "results" file, right ? Like that what you did with file = outfile, right ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Yanus: Yes, the <code>file=outfile</code> means "<code>print</code> this line of stuff to <code>outfile</code> instead of to the terminal".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe then that's all regarding the corrections of the original code ?  Firstly, the opening ''sentence'', then parameters to the file = outfile .. Just a heads-up, this is only needed for that basic commandline stuff ..  entering the source code file name, then entry values file name and then the destination text file ..Thank you abarnert, bro ..I am a civil engineer by profession so it's justified I'm not into this stuff :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Yanus: I'm not sure what you're asking. But unless I screwed up somewhere (always possible:), the only changes I made are the two I explicitly described: wrapping part of the code in a <code>with openâ€¦</code>, and adding <code>file=outfile</code> to the <code>print</code>s that I wanted (or guessed maybe you wanted) to print to that file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Yanus: As a side note, there are some great tutorials for using Python specifically for scientist/engineer/numerical-mathematician types rather than for programmers, which will probably explain things in a way that makes more sense to you, and might be worth googling for.</span>
