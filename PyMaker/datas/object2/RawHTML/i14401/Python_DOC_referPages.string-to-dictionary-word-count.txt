<p>So I'm having trouble with a homework question.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a function word_counter(input_str) which takes a string input_str and returns a dictionary mapping words in input_str to their occurrence counts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the code I have so far is:</p>
<pre><code>def word_counter(input_str):

'''function that counts occurrences of words in a string'''

    sentence = input_str.lower().split()

    counts = {}

    for w in sentence:
        counts[w] = counts.get(w, 0) + 1

    items = counts.items()
    sorted_items = sorted(items)

    return sorted_items
</code></pre>
<p>Now when I run the code with a test case such as <code>word_counter("This is a sentence")</code> in the Python shell I get the result of:</p>
<pre><code>[('a', 1), ('is', 1), ('sentence', 1), ('this', 2)]
</code></pre>
<p>Which is what is required. However, the test code that is used to check the answer is:</p>
<pre><code>word_count_dict = word_counter("This is a sentence")
items = word_count_dict.items()
sorted_items = sorted(items)
print(sorted_items)
</code></pre>
<p>And when I run it with that code I get the error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
File "&lt;string&gt;", line 2, in &lt;fragment&gt;
builtins.AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'items'
</code></pre>
<p>Not sure how to change my code so that it works with the test code given.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It looks like you found the error in the original code, so you may be all taken care of.</p>
<p>That said, you can tighten-up the code by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#counter-objects" rel="nofollow"><em>collections.Counter()</em></a>.  The example for it in the docs closely matches your assignment:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; # Find the ten most common words in Hamlet
&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; words = re.findall(r'\w+', open('hamlet.txt').read().lower())
&gt;&gt;&gt; Counter(words).most_common(10)
[('the', 1143), ('and', 966), ('to', 762), ('of', 669), ('i', 631),
 ('you', 554),  ('a', 546), ('my', 514), ('hamlet', 471), ('in', 451)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Figured out what I was doing wrong.  Just remove the last 2 lines of code and return the <em>counts</em> dictionary.  The test code does the rest :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>sorted</code> returns a list object not a dictionary object. So <code>word_counter</code> is also returning a list object and you are trying to call <code>items</code> on it, as it if you are calling it on a dictionary. That is the problem. Just do <code>print(word_counter("This is a sentence"))</code> That is enough</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your function isn't returning a dict but a list of tuples, which is what dict.items gives you in Python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@thefourtheye I understand what I'm doing wrong with the sorted and items bit now, but, what do you mean by "Just do print(word_counter("This is a sentence"))" Is that the only thing I need in the function? Sorry</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@thefourtheye Never mind, I was just adding unnecessary code.  They do the last 2 lines of my code in the test. Haha thanks heaps :)</span>
