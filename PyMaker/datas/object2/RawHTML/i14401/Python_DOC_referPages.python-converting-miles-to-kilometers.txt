<p>I am an undergraduate statistics major attempting to learn some programming on the side. I purchased a python book and am stuck on a problem. </p>
<p>The chapter introduces For Loops and the preceding introduced functions. </p>
<p>Question - Write a program <code>disttable.py</code> that prints a table of mile to kilometer conversions for distances between 100 and 1500 miles at 100 mile intervals. Write a function to do the conversion. One mile approximately 1.609 km.</p>
<p>My code thus far - </p>
<pre><code>def mile(x): 
        return 1.609 * x
def main():
    for n in range(100,100,1501):
        print(n,miles(n))
</code></pre>
<p>When I call <code>main()</code>, nothing happens. No error message. </p>
<p>I tried to place the for loop inside <code>main()</code>, however, I am unsure how to define the local variable inside the <code>main()</code> when I move the for loop there, so I end up getting a error message stating the local variable isn't defined. </p>
</div>

<p>That's because you're stepping by 1501 instead of 100:</p>
<pre><code>def mile(x): 
        return 1.609 * x
def main():
    for n in range(100,1501,100):
        print(n,mile(n))
</code></pre>

<p>You are using <code>range</code> incorrectly.  The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>range(start, stop[, step])</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going from 100 to 100 with a step of 1501 gives you no values, so your range is empty and the loop never runs.  You might have meant <code>range(100, 1501, 100)</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>List comprehensions are now the most pythonic way of doing this</p>
<pre><code>def mile(x):
     return 1.6*x 
def main():
     print [(x, mile(x)) for x in range(100,1501,100)]
</code></pre>
<p>The upshot is they evaluate lazily which for big lists means less memory pressure.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Change <code>range(100,100,1501)</code> to <code>range(100,1501,100)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You swapped the end and step.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, once you fix that, you're going to get a <code>NameError</code> because <code>miles</code> and <code>mile</code> aren't the same thing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">syntax is range(start, end +1, step)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you everyone for your help! As I responded to Ryan below, I had a blank out moment right there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ryan, Thank you very much for your help. I just had a "duh!" moment. The previous questions in this chapter I completed with the correct range syntax (start, stop, step), yet somehow forgot to do it on this one!</span>
