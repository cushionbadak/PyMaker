<span class="comment-copy">Yes! This is THE way to go</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You really should have <code>except NameError:</code> instead of the blanket except</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cdhagmann, yes, that'd be better. Thanks. Added that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">or use Sizes.get(str(Potato_size,'This is not on sale'))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hard-coding the whole statement to print in the dictionary is not a flexible solution.</span>
