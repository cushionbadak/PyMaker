<p>How to give user taking a quiz 2 chances to get the answer correct in python?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The easiest way to do this is with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements" rel="nofollow"><code>for</code></a> loop, with a <code>break</code> if they get it right, and maybe an <code>else</code> if they never got it right. For example:</p>
<pre><code>for tries in range(2):
    print("\n", "QUESTION 3:", "\n", "Which level of government is responsible for Tourism?")
    print(" a) Municipal", "\n", "b) Fedral", "\n", "c) Provincial", "\n", "d) All", "\n", "e) Legislative")
    answer3 = input("Make your choice: ")
    if answer3 == "d" or answer3 == "D" :
        print("Correct!")
        break
    else:
        print("False!")
else:
    print("Out of chances!")
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't want to re-print the question each time, just move the <code>print</code> calls before the <code>for</code>.</p>
<p>The linked tutorial section (and the following few three sections) explain this all in more detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def nTries(isCorrect, n = 2):
    answer = input("Make your choice: ")
    if isCorrect(answer):
        print("Correct")
    elif n == 1: 
        print("Out of tries, and incorrect")
    else:
        print("Incorrect")
        nTries(isCorrect, n - 1)
</code></pre>
<p>Set this up like this</p>
<pre><code>print("\n", "QUESTION 3:", "\n", "Which level of government is responsible for Tourism?")
print(" a) Municipal", "\n", "b) Fedral", "\n", "c) Provincial", "\n", "d) All", "\n", "e) Legislative")

nTries(lambda d: d.lower() == 'd')
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">As a side note, you don't need—and probably don't want—to pass a bunch of separate strings like that to <code>print</code>; just do <code>print("\nQUESTION 3:\nWhich level of government is responsible for Tourism?")</code>. Or, alternatively, <code>print()</code>, then <code>print("QUESTION 3")</code>, then <code>print("Which level of government is responsible for Tourism?")</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think a user who even knows about loops is likely to understand how to use a higher-order function like this…</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert yeah its still fun to do it this way. Its never to early to start looking at other ways to solve a problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This seems more universal <code>lambda d: d.lower() == 'd'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cwallenpoole I like it I'll update it</span>
