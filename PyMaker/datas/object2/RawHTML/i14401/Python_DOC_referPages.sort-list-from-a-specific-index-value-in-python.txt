<p>I want to sort a python list from a specific index. Here is what I want to achieve.
Consider a list <code>al = [1,2,4,3]</code>
Now what I want to do is, start from the last index, go back and swap the number which is smaller than the last index, i.e 2 which is at index 1.
now my list is <code>[1,3,4,2]</code></p>
<p>But, after swapping I want to sort the sub-list after the swapped index.
instead of <code>[1,3,4,2]</code>
I want to get to <code>[1,3,2,4]</code>
Is there any way in python to only sort the sub-list?
Right now if I use the sort method for a particular index for example:
<code>al[2:].sort()</code> It creates a new list instead of changing the same. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <code>sorted()</code> on a slice and then assign the result back to the slice:</p>
<pre><code>al[2:] = sorted(al[2:])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you wanted to do it inplace and depending on what you have in your lists, you could use numpy where <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.indexing.html" rel="nofollow">basic indexing</a> using  always returns a <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/glossary.html#term-view" rel="nofollow">view</a> of the original array:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

al = np.array([1, 2, 4, 3])

n = np.where(al &lt; al[-1])[0][-1]
al[n], al[-1] = al[-1], al[n]
al[n+1:].sort()

print(al)
[1 3 2 4]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Alright, so there is no other function like list.sort() to sort the list without assignment?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EkwinderSaini: Not with a general list. But if the data you're working on can fit in bytes (i.e., 0-255) you could use a  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview" rel="nofollow noreferrer">memoryview</a> on a  bytearray. But there's probably not much point unless your collection is huge - the list slice argument to <code>sorted()</code> created by NPE's code is only temporary &amp; will be quickly garbage-collected.</span>
