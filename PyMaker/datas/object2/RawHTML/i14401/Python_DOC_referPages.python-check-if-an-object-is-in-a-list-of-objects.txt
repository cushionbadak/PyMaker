<p>i'm trying to check if a certain object of mine is in a list of objects, </p>
<p>and i want to do it without going in nested loops.</p>
<p>i have for example an object of type X with fields of types W,E,R.</p>
<p>i also have a list L of objects of type X.</p>
<p>my question is - if i will ask, (myobj in L)</p>
<p>will it return True if there is an object of type X in  the list, OR will it </p>
<p>return True only if there is an object of type X in L, that have the same W,E,R</p>
<p>of myobj?</p>
<p>======================= edited: ======================================</p>
<p>first time i ran the above code (i.e. obj in L), </p>
<pre><code>for log in logs[first_users[0]]:
    self.assertTrue(log in first_users[0].get_log())
</code></pre>
<p>for the above code i got an error because i had a log that wasn't in </p>
<p>first_users[0].get_log() (it was different by one object)</p>
<p>then i ran:</p>
<pre><code>for log in first_users[0].get_log():
        self.assertTrue(log in logs[first_users[0]])
</code></pre>
<p>and i didn't get any errors - which is good.</p>
<p>i even tried to change a specific object in the logs:</p>
<pre><code>for log in first_users[0].get_log():
    log.obj = None
    log.save()
    self.assertTrue(log in logs[first_users[0]])
</code></pre>
<p>and it still didn't through an error - which isn't good</p>

<p>Go through <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>. It's the page on operator overloading in classes. Find the function that you need!</p>
<p>Edit: You need to implement <code>__eq__</code> to check if the members of two objects are equal.
Eg:</p>
<pre><code>class Foo:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
    def __eq__(self, other):
        if self.val == other.val:
            return True
        return False

l = [Foo(i) for i in range(10)]
print(Foo(2) in l)
print(Foo(100) in l)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>True
False
</code></pre>
<p>You can choose not to check all the members and compare only the ones that matter to you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So what have you tried then? If you want answers you'll need to ask a real question by showing your code, research, and efforts made to solve the problem on your own.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you try it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you that fixed my problem</span>
