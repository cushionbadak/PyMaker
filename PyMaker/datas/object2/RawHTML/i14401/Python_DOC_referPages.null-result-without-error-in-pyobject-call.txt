<p>I'm currently coding a Python C-Extension to perform some calculations in C instead of Python. It works just fine, I already got some nice results, but the point is, I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>NULL result without error in PyObject_Call
</code></pre>
<p>It occurs sometimes, not always, when I want to create an instance of the "C Python Object" I created. The call looks something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>import c_class

obj = c_class.dummy(arg1, arg2, arg3);
</code></pre>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions? I don't know where this error comes from, since it works from time to time.. I'm kind of lost here. </p>

<p>When you return <code>NULL</code> from a c function exposed to python you must set the error message before, since returning <code>NULL</code> means an error happened.</p>
<p>If an error happened and you are returning <code>NULL</code> because of that then, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/exceptions.html" rel="nofollow"><code>PyErr_SetString()</code></a>, if no error happened, then use</p>
<pre><code>Py_RETURN_NONE;
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think an error happened.. that's what's puzzling me. Anyway: how would I use that PyErr_SetString() function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is the c function yours? did you return <code>NULL</code> from it, it's you who decides if an error happened. Why is the function returning <code>NULL</code>, can you post it's code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah, it's my function. It's a void function though, doesn't it mean I don't have to return anything?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As a matter of fact, it seems to work now. I'll be in touch if I stumble upon it again. Thanks a lot.</span>
