<p>However, I keep getting the problem with the storage module, no client attribute.</p>
<pre><code>from google.cloud import storage
# Instantiates a client
storage_client = storage.Client(credentials=creds, project='name')
# The name for the new bucket
bucket_name = 'my-new-bucket'
# Creates the new bucket
bucket = storage_client.create_bucket(bucket_name)
print('Bucket {} created.'.format(bucket.name))

<p>This is a problem I've seen several times, and happens as well in other google.cloud modules. Most of the time it is related to a broken installation</p>
<p>Try to uninstall and then installgoogle.cloud packages. If no luck, try to use it on a newly created virtual environment (this will work for sure)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried to uninstall and install again. Same issue. Also doing this locally.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you try with a virtual environment? If you're using <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">conda</a> or without conda using <a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">virtual env</a>. If you don't want to create a virtual environment and you're using anaconda, try to reinstall the whole anaconda</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Created a new virtualenv, no success. :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you please share the exact pip command you're using for installing the cloud datastore package?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">After messing around for a bit, I managed to get it working. Created another new virtualenv, and installed google-cloud-storage normally.</span>
