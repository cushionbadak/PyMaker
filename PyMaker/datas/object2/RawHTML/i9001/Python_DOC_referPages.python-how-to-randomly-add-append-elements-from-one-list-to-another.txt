<p>Hey, so the above program is supposed to randomly add 4 of the elements from the list called colours into the other list named current. I have looked through the forums, but I cannot find help specific to this case.</p>
<p>In short, Is there a quick and efficient way to add 4 random elements from one list straight into another?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>To fix your original code, do</p>
<pre><code>current.append(random.choice(colours))
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre><code>current = random.choice(colours)
</code></pre>
<p>You should also make <code>current</code> a local variable and return it rather than a global variable. In the same light, you should pass the array of choices as a parameter rather than working on a global variable directory. Both of these changes will give your function greater flexibility.</p>

<p>You're describing the basic usage of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.sample</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; colours = ["Red","Yellow","Blue","Green","Orange","White"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.sample(colours, 4)
['Red', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Orange']
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to allow duplicates, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.choices</code></a> instead (new in Python 3.6).  </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choices(colours, k=4)
['Green', 'White', 'White', 'Red']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hey thanks for the answer, is there a way that I could do this without the duplicates?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JayHunkys sure. In words, you need to check the <code>current</code> list to see if it already contains the next choice before appending it. See how I start by describing the solution in English? I leave it up to you too refine this a little more so that you can translate it into code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JayHunkys alternatively, you can use a <code>set</code> which will do the check for you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I got it all working now just how I wanted. I appreciate your time.</span>
