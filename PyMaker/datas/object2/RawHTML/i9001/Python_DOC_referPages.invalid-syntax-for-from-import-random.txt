<p>Your code is full of errors. I have fixed indentation and other syntax issues.
You don't need to use from, just use <code>import random</code>.</p>

<p>Fixed your indentation, spelling, capitalization, insertion of unnecessary spaces and comparing between a <code>string</code> and <code>int</code> which would always be false.</p>
<p>Also added <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.title" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.title</code></a> to allow for all types of capitalization for <code>restart</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Looks like you'd better get back to whatever resource you have for learning Python: There's a surprisingly large number of errors in that small amount of code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">fix your import back to the correct <code>import random</code> and your indentation and if you still have a problem say explicitly what it is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thankyou @shash678 but would this still work if i joined multiple scripts together or would i have to put import at every individual script if i wanted to create a "game room?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Scratchndent What your asking is covered in this question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1057765/6328256">stackoverflow.com/a/1057765/6328256</a> but I have a feeling it might be a little to advanced for you... so while you are still new just put the same import statements at the top of each of your <code>game</code> scripts. By the way would you be able to mark my answer as correct/helpful by hitting the green tick button?</span>
