<p>I'm new to Python, coming from Matlab like many. I'm used to defining my functions as standalone .m files and calling them easily from a second script as long as the function is saved somewhere within the defined Matlab path. </p>
<p>I've learned how to define a (user-defined) function in Python (def my_function() etc.), but I'm coming up short in my Google searches on a way to define the function in a a separate .py file A, and how to call it in another script B. All help files I can find give support on how to define the function within the same script. When I try calling the function (which I've defined as a .py file in the same folder I'm using for script A) my script doesn't recognize it. Do I need to be declaring the function at the beginning of my script? I'm getting the sense that Python is very different in the way it handles these things than Matlab--perhaps I can't do this?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>You have to use imports</p>
<p>for example, you have the function doSomething() in functions.py and want to work in main.py</p>
<p>in main.py</p>
<pre><code>from functions import doSomething

var = doSomething()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">its not the pythonic way of doing things, but you can drop a bunch of functions in a file, say <code>funcs.py</code> in the same folder as the main script. then in the main script you do <code>import funcs</code> now you can do <code>func.my_func()</code> etc...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official tutorial</a>.</span>
