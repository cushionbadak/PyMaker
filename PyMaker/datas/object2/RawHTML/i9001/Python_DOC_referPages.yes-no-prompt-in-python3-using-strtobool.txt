<p>I've been trying to write an elegant [y/n] prompt for scripts that I'll be running over command line. I came across this:</p>
<p><a href="http://mattoc.com/python-yes-no-prompt-cli.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://mattoc.com/python-yes-no-prompt-cli.html</a></p>
<p>This is the program I wrote up to test it (it really just involved changing raw_input to input as I'm using Python3):</p>
<pre><code>import sys
from distutils import strtobool

def prompt(query):
    sys.stdout.write("%s [y/n]: " % query)
    val = input()
    try:
        ret = strtobool(val)
    except ValueError:
        sys.stdout.write("Please answer with y/n")
        return prompt(query)
    return ret

while True:
    if prompt("Would you like to close the program?") == True:
        break
    else:
        continue
</code></pre>
<p>However, whenever I try to run the code I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>ImportError: cannot import name strtobool
</code></pre>
<p>Changing "from distutils import strtobool" to "import distutils" doesn't help, as a NameError is raised:</p>
<pre><code>Would you like to close the program? [y/n]: y
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "yes_no.py", line 15, in &lt;module&gt;
    if prompt("Would you like to close the program?") == True:
  File "yes_no.py", line 6, in prompt
    val = input()
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'y' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>How do I go about solving this problem?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The first error message:</p>
<p><code>ImportError: cannot import name strtobool</code></p>
<p>is telling you that there's no publically visible <code>strtobool</code> function in the <code>distutils</code> module you've imported.</p>
<p>This is because it's moved in python3: <strong>use <code>from distutils.util import strtobool</code> instead.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/apiref.html#distutils.util.strtobool" rel="noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/apiref.html#distutils.util.strtobool</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>The second error message deeply confuses me -- it seems to imply that the <code>y</code> you input is trying to be interpretted as code (and therefore complains that it doesn't know about any <code>y</code> variable. I can't quite see how that'd happen!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Afaik, the piece of code I took off the website is written in 2.x, whereas I'm trying to replicate it in 3.x</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Works perfectly now! I tried to 'import distutils' and then use distutils.util.strtobool in the function too, but clearly that wasn't the right approach. The second error is still a mystery to me. Could it be because of how I'm trying to import strtobool, but the function isn't there, while the program is still trying to execute the prompt function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Really shouldn't be; unless you've got <code>eval(...)</code> or similar somewhere in your code your data shouldn't ever get executed. (Data getting executed is often a big security problem... )</span>
