<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finish the function sum_of_over_fives that loops over number_list and adds to the total only the numbers greater than 5. Then it should return the total.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>def sum_of_over_fives(number_list):
       total = 0
       for number in number_list:
           number &gt;5
             total += number
       return total
</code></pre>
<p>I get an indent error for "number &gt;5" line but I have this gut feeling that the line is wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the built-ins <code>filter</code> and <code>sum</code>:</p>
<pre><code>total = sum(filter(lambda x: x &gt; 5, number_list))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As pointed out by @Mitch and @StephenRauch, your logic is fine, the only problem is with your indentation and the <code>number &gt; 5</code> which should be an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">if statement</a>. </p>
<p>According to the PEP 8 documentation, you must make sure that the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">indentation of your function body is 4 </a>,  at the moment, it is 8.</p>
<p>Then the only thing left will be to put the <code>if</code> and the <code>:</code> to go with the <code>number &gt; 5</code>. Here is your final code with the corrected indentations and the correct <code>if</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>def sum_of_over_fives(number_list):
    total = 0
    for number in number_list:
        if number &gt; 5:
            total += number
    return total

print(sum_of_over_fives([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]))
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
13
</code></pre>
<p>But like @a_guest said, there is a better way of doing what you are trying to do. </p>
<p>I hope that help :). </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Does the indentation look correct to you? If so, why? What are you expecting to happen with <code>number &gt; 5</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>if number &gt; 5:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried indenting different ways the main error is " IndentationError: expected an indented block.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Stephen - I had tried  using 'if' as well I still get the indentation error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If he turned that in for his assignment, the prof would know he got it here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well but this is how you solve the problem in Python. The OP's code is C-style, not Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">walk before run.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@a_guest I suppose we'll agree to disagree. I find it to be a low-quality answer to a low-quality question that should be closed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@a_guest Suppose Python is my first language. What do you think I learn first - raw loop control flow, or built-in function abstractions? Come on.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ Tshilidzi Mudau I appreciate your response. Thank you for your explanation.</span>
