<p>I have 2 lists, and I want to match each item with related index. what is the formula ? I have used set but it does not consider specific index.</p>
<pre><code>list1 = [1 , 2 , 3, 5, 8]
list2 = [2 , 2 , 8, 5, 1]

out_put= [2 , 5]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You may use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> to filter the same elements at each index of both the lists as:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list1 = [1 , 2 , 3, 5, 8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list2 = [2 , 2 , 8, 5, 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [i for i, j in zip(list1, list2) if i==j]
[2, 5]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>res = [x[0] for x in zip(list1, list2) if x[0] == x[1]] # [2, 5]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@JimFasarakisHilliard I do not think it is a right dupe target as this question is related to common elements between the two lists at the same index (unlike finding the intersection of two list). I am not reopening the question, in case I missed anything and you might be able to clarify me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MoinuddinQuadri the answer you gave (<code>[i for i, j in zip(list1, list2) if i==j]</code>) is nearly exactly the same as the code in the top answer from the dupe (<code>[i for i, j in zip(a, b) if i == j]</code>). So I would argue that this is an accurate dupe target.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JGreenwell Yeah. I saw that. I am not sure why someone wrote this answer in that question :/ Because again that answer was irrelevant there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My assumption is it was so we could have one dupe target for both cases @MoinuddinQuadri and then people could find the version they needed through the linked duplicates.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh boy , you beat me in 20 sec.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Arman god you guys are fast... couldn't blink an eye and already answered...</span>
