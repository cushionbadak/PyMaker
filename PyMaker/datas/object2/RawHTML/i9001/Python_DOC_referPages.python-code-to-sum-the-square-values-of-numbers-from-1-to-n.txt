<p>I am struggling to add numbers by using python. Could you please aid me. Thank you.</p>

<p>Here is how you would do it in Python 2:</p>
<pre><code>n = int(raw_input("Type n:"))
total = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    total += i**2
print total
</code></pre>
<p>Here is how you would do it in Python 3:</p>
<pre><code>n = int(input("Type n:"))
total = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    total += i**2
print(total)
</code></pre>
<p>This takes the numbers 1 through <code>n</code> and put them into variable <code>i</code>.  For each time this happens, it takes the square of <code>i</code> and adds it onto <code>total</code>.  It then prints the total.</p>
<p>I suggest reading a Python book.  "Hello World" by Carter and Warren Sande is a fantastic one!</p>
<p>If you need further clarification, notify me in the comments.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can use the addition operator <code>+</code> or the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code></a> function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i dont want to use the sum function. Also if i have like 300 numbers i can add them individually</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried? Have you familiarized yourself with basic Python syntax yet? This is an extremely elementary question that I'm sure can be resolved with a little work to learn the bare minimum elements of the language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">doing so as we speak</span>
