<p>python newbie - </p>
<p>I have multiple text documents that contain users from several AD groups, I need to parse through each document and group users(usernames) by their group membership: for instance: 
Marketing doc has Marketing_grp:</p>
<pre><code>John, Bob, Sally
</code></pre>
<p>Sales doc has Sales_grp:</p>
<pre><code>Bob, Ron, Jeff
</code></pre>
<p>Technology doc has Technology_grp:</p>
<pre><code>Bob, Mike, Sally
</code></pre>
<p>I need to be able to see that both Bob and Sally belong to multiple groups and I need to know what those groups are, how can I accomplish this with Python?</p>
<p>The data in the text file is in the form of email addresses as in username@company.com</p>
<pre><code>#AD Group Usage
import re
from sys import argv
import shelve

script, filename = argv

def ADgrps(filename):
    f=open(filename, "r+")
    text=f.read()
    ad_grps = re.findall(r'[\w]+(?=@)', text)
    return ad_grps
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd do something like this.</p>
<pre><code>import re
import sys

groups = {}
for s in sys.argv[1:]:
    with open(s) as f:
        for t in re.findall(r"[\w]+(?=@)", f.read()):
            if t in groups:
                groups[t].append(s)
            else:
                groups[t] = [s]

# Do stuff with the data.
</code></pre>
<p>Now you have a dictionary mapping emails to the files they appear in.  This code expects the names of the relevant files to be passed as command-line arguments.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">how big are the text documents? can you read all 3 into memory ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There will be about 50 documents some with 12 users, others with 100+ users</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Excellent! Really appreciate your help. Just out of curiosity, is it just experience that I need or is there a good book and/or course you can recommend for learning python?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Ditto.  That's how I learned.</span>
