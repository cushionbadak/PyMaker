<p>I have some code in Python 3 that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>import re

searchChar = string1[0]
re.finditer(searchChar, a_string)
</code></pre>
<p>So the idea is to find the indices of all occurrences of a character in a string.</p>
<p>The problem is that <code>string1</code> could be anything, so if it's something normal like <code>string1 = 'cat'</code> or <code>string1 = 'dog'</code>, then everything is fine.</p>
<p>But if it starts with a regular expression control character then you have a problem.  For example, if you have <code>string1 = *hello</code>, then <code>searchChar</code> is <code>'*'</code>, and <code>findIter</code> will return an error since <code>'*'</code> is an invalid regex.</p>
<p>In my scenario I'm always searching for a character literal.  So is there a way to ensure that <code>searchChar</code> is escaped (i.e. <code>'\*'</code>) if and only if it needs to be?</p>

<p>Do a plain string search. If you want to count occurrences of a substring, <code>str</code> instances provide the <code>count</code>  method for that.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '*|*|'.count('*')
2
</code></pre>

<p>Niemmi's comment was the answer I needed.  Looks like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.escape" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re.escape</a> is the answer.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">seems like regex gets more in the way that it helps. What about simple string search?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.escape" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.escape</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You do not need <code>re</code> for finding occurrence of a character in a string, something like <code>string.find</code> should suffice. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.find" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.find</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I wasn't clear in the question.  I'm trying to find the <b>indices</b> of each occurrence of the character, not just the number of occurrences.  I updated the question to reflect that.</span>
