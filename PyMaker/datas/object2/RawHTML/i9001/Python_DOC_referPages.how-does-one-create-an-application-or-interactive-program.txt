<p>I know how to program in C++ and python, but I have only ever built console applications. How do you get programs to have buttons, pictures, colors... Everything that you think of when you would think of an app or computer application.</p>
<p>Thank you for the help in advance. I am just trying to learn how to make real, usable programs. I would like to simply be pointed in the right direction.</p>

<p>First read something about:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Event driven programming</a></p>
<p>Then take a look at the following.</p>
<p>For Python:</p>
<p><a href="http://ttps://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TkInter</a> for buttons, windows etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PyOpenGl</a> for 2D and 3D graphics, pictures etc.</p>
<p>For C++:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">WxWidgets</a> or <a href="https://www.qt.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Qt</a> for buttons, windows etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.opengl.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OpenGl</a> for 2D and 3D graphics, pictures etc.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So console applications are no "real, usable programs"?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Not for most people. Mainstream applications aren't console based, like phone and desktop apps.</span>
