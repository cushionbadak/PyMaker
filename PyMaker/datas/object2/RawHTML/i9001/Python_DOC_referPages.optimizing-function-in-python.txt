<p>The function take 4 input as x,y,w,z and I want to optimize the function with constraint as x + y + w + z = 1 and all 4 should be less than 1. How should I approach this task?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If I understood correctly, the following solution should fit your initial requirement:</p>
<pre><code>def checkAllForOne(x,y,w,z):
    args = [x,y,w,z]
    return all(i &lt; 1 for i in args) and sum(args) == 1

print(checkAllForOne(0.2, 0.25, 0.25, 0.3))  # True
print(checkAllForOne(0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.3))  # False
print(checkAllForOne(0.5, 0.4, 0.1, 0))      # True
</code></pre>
<p><em>Used functions:</em><br/>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow noreferrer">all()</a> - to check if each of arguments is less than <code>1</code><br/>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sum()</a> - to check the total sum of the arguments</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Define your contraints and write some code? As stated, your optimisation has an infinite number of solutions anyway. Please see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">How to ask</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>all 4 should be less than 1</i> - how they can give <code>1</code> as the result if they are all less than <code>1</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RomanPerekhrest <code>0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@roganjosh, I suppose to get that from the OP to be sure</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RomanPerekhrest That's how I've interpreted the question. Each argument should be less than 1. But there's an infinite number of answers. If you allow user input for all 4 variables, they either get it to satisfy the constraint or not. If you want a computer to solve it, there's no logical one answer.</span>
