<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>re.sub(r"([GAT])G", r"\g&lt;1&gt;A", "GCGGG")
</code></pre>
<p>which gives me result: 'GCGAG',</p>
<p>But I really want to get is 'GCGAA', what should I do?</p>
<p>why is the last 'G' doesn't change to 'A'?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>GG</code> was the first match; its second <code>G</code> canâ€™t participate in another match. You can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lookbehind</a> to check if a pattern is preceded by another pattern without including that check in the match, though:</p>
<pre><code>re.sub(r"(?&lt;=[GAT])G", "A", "GCGGG")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Matches can't overlap. There's no good way to make sense of the overlapping replacements. <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Other regex libraries</a> support overlapping matches, but still not for replacements.</span>
