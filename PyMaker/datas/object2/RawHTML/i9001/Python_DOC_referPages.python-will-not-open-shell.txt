<p>I  think it is called a shell. the window that one writes and runs python in.<br/>
I have installed python 2.7.135;   it runs from command line, but will not open when clicking on the python gear icon in dolphin.   </p>

<p>Am I  missing something?</p>
<p>when I  installed in on win7, it opened a shell that i could program, save,  and run.  In kubuntu 14.xx I can only open it  in command line.</p>

<p>I think you should add more context and clarity to the question.
From what I understand, Python, in Windows environment, comes bundled with the IDLE - a window to write programs and run and another one to see the execution results. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html</a></p>
<p>You may install a Python IDE (PyCharm, Sublime), etc. or just use the bare-bone python shell. If the linux machine is local, then you may also run IDLE itself.</p>

<p>you have to run it via comandline.
run cmd dir to directory and than type in python type in not clicking</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You seem to have a bash UNIX (like) OS. On most of them Python is already installed. Just run <code>python</code> at the prompt. Also there seems to be a <code>python</code> file in that folder. Try to run <code>./python</code> there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A lot answer on stack, Did you declared any MIME types ? Did you have any permission <code>a+x</code> on related file ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@dsgdfg, no MINE declared, no clue what that is. no clue what is meant by permission a+x</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KlausD., "it runs from command line, but will not open when clicking on the python gear icon in dolphin"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Off course your OS very smart cos know your choice <code>edit/run/file_opt</code>. Create a <code>my_exec.desktop</code> file and determine what you want !  Your point is not right....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you. you answered the question.  i am missing the ide, which is bundled in winblows and expected it to also be bundled for linux.</span>
