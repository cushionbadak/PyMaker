<p>I'm currently running this:</p>
<pre><code>image = urllib.urlopen(imgUrl)
pool3_features = sess.run(pool3,{'incept/DecodeJpeg/contents:0': image})

<p>and I get this error:</p>

<p>Unable to get element from the feed as bytes.</p>

<p>The solution was quite simple... All I had to do was call the <code>read</code> method on response from urlopen. The following works like a charm:</p>
<pre><code>image = urllib.urlopen(imgUrl)
pool3_features = sess.run(pool3,{'incept/DecodeJpeg/contents:0': image.read()})
</code></pre>

<p>Just use a method to load it into NumPy and then load that into TensorFlow. This is likely more reliable, more flexible.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you post a full runable code, What is the meaning of the <code>gfile</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry, I want to place the img data into a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#binary-i-o" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bytesio</a>,  but i didn't find any api can be used in tensorflow.</span>
