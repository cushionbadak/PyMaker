<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Basically I want something that was asked in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/798854/all-combinations-of-a-list-of-lists">All combinations of a list of lists</a>,
but using ONLY <code>while</code> or/and <code>for</code> loops. In the other words, without the use of <code>itertools</code> nor recursion.</p>
<p>I know many similar questions have been asked before, but unfortunately I could not find a desired answer. I have looked for some solutions which make use of both loops and recursions, but when I attempted to translate them into only loops, I found out it did not work for me. I have thought of putting <code>for</code> loop inside a <code>while</code> loop but then it works differently than using recursion, because the entire <code>for</code> loop finishes before another <code>while</code> loop starts.</p>
<p>I have stuck for hours, any help/hint is greatly appreciated. I am using Python 3 though!</p>

<p>Well, if you are asking for an implementation of <code>itertools.product</code> using only for-loops, you'll find exactly that in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>.</p>
<pre><code>def product(*args, repeat=1):
    # product('ABCD', 'xy') --&gt; Ax Ay Bx By Cx Cy Dx Dy
    # product(range(2), repeat=3) --&gt; 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111
    pools = [tuple(pool) for pool in args] * repeat
    result = [[]]
    for pool in pools:
        result = [x+[y] for x in result for y in pool]
    for prod in result:
        yield tuple(prod)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Assuming that args is always &lt;listof &lt;listof Str&gt;&gt;, is there any way to change this so neither tuple nor yield is used?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@slopys1324 Well, sure. Use <code>list</code> instead of <code>tuple</code>, and accumulate the results of the last for-loop into a list and return it instead of using yield.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Probably the last question. Is there an equivalent way of doing <code>[x+[y] for x in result for y in pool]</code> instead of putting two for-loops on one line? Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've tried myself but it ends up with an infinite loop for some reason.</span>
