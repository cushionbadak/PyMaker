<p>I have a csv file containing 8 columns with a header row. The first 5 columns contain binary data, and the last three contain integers. How can I read this file using python?</p>

<p>You can use the Pandas package, specifically the <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>read_csv</code></a> method. Alternatively there is a built in module called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv</a> that contains methods for working with csv files in python. I recommend reading both of these pages as they will provide you with a great launching pad for working with csv files in Python. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just import the csv module:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
file = open("Your_file.csv")
reader = csv.reader(file)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>as Grr suggested, the pandas library is your best bet</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_.csv')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I usually use the csv.DictReader from the csv module. This is a pattern I commonly use myself. The col1 through col7 or whatever can be names anything you want as long as you get the column names correct from the file, where it says ['col name']. After doing this you can call each column of data by name.</p>
<pre><code>import csv
import os

os.chdir('directory where file is')

for col in csv.DictReader(open('filename.csv'))
    col1 = int(col['col name'])
    col2 = int(col['col name'])
    col3 = int(col['col name'])
    col4 = int(col['col name'])
    col5 = int(col['col name'])
    col6 = col['col name']
    col7 = col['col name']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What are you looking to do with the data once it is in Python? How many rows are present? Reading it in through <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pandas.read_csv</a> will allow you to manipulate the file as a dataframe.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's a Python <code>csv</code> library... Look it up.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Pretty much any search terms you google including: <code>python</code> and <code>csv</code> will show you how.  We're not going to write the code for you.</span>
