<p>I'm a begginer in Python and I have a little problem with JSON. In the tutorial I'm working with there are two functions: </p>
<pre><code>def read_json(filename):
    data = []
    if os.path.isfile(filename):
        with open(filename, "r") as f:
            data = json.load(f)
    return data


def save_json(filename, data):
    with open(filename, "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f)
</code></pre>
<p>But when I try to save my data there's an error in saving: </p>
<pre><code>raise TypeError(repr(o) + " is not JSON serializable")
TypeError: {1, 3} is not JSON serializable
</code></pre>
<p>Can somebody help me? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>{1, 3}</code> is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>set</code></a>, which as the error points out, cannot be serialized to JSON - the only collection <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example" rel="nofollow noreferrer">types</a> in JSON are lists (called arrays in JSON) and dictionaries (called objects in JSON).</p>
<p>You'll need to convert it to a list:</p>
<pre><code>converted = list(my_data)
save_json(my_filename, converted)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you post sample json data which you are writing and also check the type(data) which you are writing to file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yup. thanks it works.</span>
