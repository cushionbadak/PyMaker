<p>I'm stuck with my code for a problem where you get the user to enter a series of numbers/letters and the program returns all viable postal codes using the parameters provided. Here is the question in detail: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a program that reads in numbers from the user. Your program
  should be capable of tracking/calculating the minimum, maximum, total
  sum, and average of the numbers entered. When the user enters "q",
  "Q", or "quit", the program should display the minimum, maximum, total
  sum, and average of the numbers entered before ending. You can assume
  that the user will always enter either a number or one of the strings
  “q”, “Q”, or “quit”. You can also assume the user will always enter at
  least one number (i.e., they will not immediately choose to quit upon
  starting the program).</p>
<p>Save your Python program in a file called a2q3.py and add it to your
  submission zip file. Problem 4 (Postal Sorting Codes)</p>
<p>The forward sortation area code is the first three characters of a
  Canadian postal code (e.g., the "K1S" in postal code "K1S 5B6") and it
  has the format:  </p>
<ul>
<li>First Character: a letter between A and Z  </li>
<li>Middle Character: a number between 0 and 9 including zero and including 9    -  - Last Character: a letter between A and Z  </li>
</ul>
<p>You will create a program to generate a subset of the possible
  sortation area codes. Instead of using the entire range, you must
  write a program using nested loops that generates all the possible
  codes that fit constraints specified by the user. Your program should
  request the following information from the user:  </p>
<ol>
<li>The starting letter of the first character  </li>
<li>The ending letter of the first character  </li>
<li>The starting digit of the middle character  </li>
<li>The ending digit of the middle character  </li>
<li>The starting letter of the last character  </li>
<li>The ending letter of the last character  </li>
</ol>
<p>Your program should then print out all possible combinations that fit
  these constraints. Each of the ranges should include both the starting
  and ending value, as well as all values in between. You can assume
  that the user will only enter valid input (i.e., upper case characters
  for the letters and 0-9 for the digits).   You cannot use Python’s
  lists, dictionary or set functionality to iterate over the letters.
  Instead, you should use the ord() function to find the integer values
  of the specified letters (i.e., the ASCII values) and the chr()
  function to translate from integers back to letters (for more
  information on these functions, visit
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html</a>). After printing out
  each of the possible codes, your program should print out the total
  number of codes before ending.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>start_let_first_char=input("Please enter the starting letter of the first character: ")
end_let_first_char=input("Please enter the ending letter of the first character: ")

start_dig_mid=int(input("Please enter the starting digit of the middle character: "))
end_dig_mid=int(input("Please enter the ending digit of the middle character: "))

start_let_last_char=input("Please enter the starting letter of the last character: ")
end_let_last_char=input("Please enter the ending letter of the last character: ")

for x in range(ord(start_let_first_char),ord(end_let_first_char)+1):
    for y in range(start_dig_mid,end_dig_mid +1):
        for z in range(ord(start_let_last_char),ord(end_let_last_char)+1):
            print(chr(x)+str(y)+chr(z))
</code></pre>
<p>The error I keep getting when I run the code and enter all the letters/digits is:  </p>
<pre><code>    for z in range(ord(start_let_last_char,ord(end_let_last_char)+1)):  
TypeError: ord() takes exactly one argument (2 given) 
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks, it's fixed and working! I forgot to add a counter for the postal codes. Should I just add a counter and a print(counter) function at the end, or can someone recommend a better way to do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This:</p>
<pre><code>for z in range(ord(start_let_last_char,ord(end_let_last_char)+1)):
</code></pre>
<p>Should be:</p>
<pre><code>for z in range(ord(start_let_last_char),ord(end_let_last_char)+1):
</code></pre>
<p>A comma was misplaced there.</p>
<p>With the counter added:</p>
<pre><code>letter_1_start = input(
    "Please enter the starting letter of the first character: ")
letter_1_end = input(
    "Please enter the ending letter of the first character: ")

digit_start = int(
    input("Please enter the starting digit of the middle character: "))
digit_end = int(
    input("Please enter the ending digit of the middle character: "))

letter_2_start = input(
    "Please enter the starting letter of the last character: ")
letter_2_end = input(
    "Please enter the ending letter of the last character: ")

counter = 0

for x in range(ord(letter_1_start), ord(letter_1_end) + 1):
    for y in range(digit_start, digit_end + 1):
        for z in range(ord(letter_2_start), ord(letter_2_end) + 1):
            print(chr(x) + str(y) + chr(z))
            counter += 1

print("Total number of codes:", counter)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">And what is unclear about the error message? You are giving two arguments to <code>ord</code>, what were you expecting it to do with them?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You misplaced a ), I think, it should read: for z in range(ord(start_let_last_char),ord(end_let_last_char)+1):</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe Sorry.... I can read that it wants one argument and I'm giving two but I'm just not sure how to fix this/why what I'm trying isn't working. Can you point me in the right direction?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sphericalcowboy thank you!!!! that fixed it!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem. You might want to selected my answer then if this fixes the issue.</span>
