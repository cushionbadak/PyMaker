<p>So I am trying to create a sort of calculator that handles all types of equations. All you have to do is input what you need help on and it will ask you a series of questions based on what equation you need help one, and it will return a value. I am trying to make it so that when a certain string is inputted, it will ask a certain series of questions. However, it asks all the questions regardless of what I input. 
I'm using Python 3.6.</p>
<pre><code>    whichEquation = input("What are you having trouble with?   ")

if whichEquation:
    "interest"

r = float(input("What is the interest rate?: "))
C = float(input("Deposit cash: "))
t = float(input("For how many years will your deposit be invested?: "))
n = float(input("How many times per year is the interest compounded?: "))

interest = C * (1 + r/n)**(n*t)


print("Your future value is: ",interest,"dollars")

if whichEquation:
    "slope"

y1 = float(input("First y point: "))
y2 = float(input("Second y point: "))
x1 = float(input("First X point: "))
x2 = float(input("Second X point: "))

slope = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)

print("The slope is:",slope)
</code></pre>
<p>So how would I only show either the 'slope' equation or the 'interest' equation if whichEquation is slope or interest.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your indentation is incorrect, it should be</p>
<pre><code>if whichEquation == "slope":
    y1 = float(input("First y point: "))
    y2 = float(input("Second y point: "))
    x1 = float(input("First X point: "))
    x2 = float(input("Second X point: "))

    slope = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)

    print("The slope is:",slope)
</code></pre>
<p>This is because anything that comes indented underneath an if statement is the action the if statement does.</p>
<p>This goes for both IF statements, not just the slope one.</p>
<p>And lastly, an IF statement checks if an item matches something specific using the "==" operator, which is basically "is equal to", so <code>if whichEquation == "slope"</code> is the same as <code>if (what ever is stored in) whichEquation is equal to "slope"</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>the shortest way to solve this is to bring all related code under if block </p>
<pre><code>if whichEquation == "interest":
    r = float(input("What is the interest rate?: ")) 
    C = float(input("Deposit cash: ")) 
    t = float(input("For how many years will your deposit be invested?: "))
    n = float(input("How many times per year is the interest compounded?: ")) 
    interest = C * (1 + r/n)**(n*t) 
    print("Your future value is: ",interest,"dollars") 
</code></pre>
<p>hope this help </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can format your code like so:</p>
<pre><code>whichEquation = input("What are you having trouble with?   ")

if whichEquation == "interest":

     r = float(input("What is the interest rate?: "))
     C = float(input("Deposit cash: "))
     t = float(input("For how many years will your deposit be   
     invested?: "))
     n = float(input("How many times per year is the interest compounded?: "))

     interest = C * (1 + r/n)**(n*t)


     print("Your future value is: ",interest,"dollars")

 elif whichEquation == "slope":
      y1 = float(input("First y point: "))
      y2 = float(input("Second y point: "))
      x1 = float(input("First X point: "))
      x2 = float(input("Second X point: "))

      slope = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)

      print("The slope is:",slope)
</code></pre>
<p>This way, your whitespace is correct and will properly read each condition</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I believe from what you are saying, you want the program to ask questions depending on the <strong>selected input</strong>.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, you must add == to check if the two variables are equal.</p>
<pre><code>if whichEquation == "slope":
</code></pre>
<p>This is because python was multiple ways of testing variables with the if statment. Some common ones that are more math related are:</p>
<p>*Less than  &lt;   *</p>
<p>*Greater than   &gt;   *</p>
<p><em>Less than or equal     &lt;=</em></p>
<p><em>Greater than or equal  &gt;=</em></p>
<p><em>Equals  ==</em></p>
<p><em>Not equal    !=</em></p>
<p>I suggest going to <a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/ifstatements.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This python 3 doc</a>, which demonstrates different IF statement conditions.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>if whichEquation: "interest"</code> -&gt; what do you think this code means? The same goes for <code>if whichEquation: "slope"</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My understanding was it means that if whichEquation is the string "interest" then it will do a certain thing. Same thing for slope.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This <code>if whichEquation:</code> means 'if whichEquation is <i>truthy</i>, i.e. not an empty string, not zero, etc, then execute the block', so in your case, the block consists of a mere string, and running it does nothing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, this really helped! I started python today so thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No worries! :) Python is a great language, I'm glad it helped.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SaeedD: So why don't you read the official tutorial? Chapter 4 explains <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>if</code> statements</a>.</span>
