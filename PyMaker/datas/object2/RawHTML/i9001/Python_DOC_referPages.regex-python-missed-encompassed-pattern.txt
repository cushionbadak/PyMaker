<p>I have tried to research answers to this question online, but nothing seems to describe the problem I have here. If I missed something, please close the question and redirect it to where it has already been answered. </p>
<p>That being said, my python regex doesn't seem to want to recognize a pattern if it is already encompassed in another captured pattern. I tried to run the code and here are the results:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; string = 'NNTSY'
&gt;&gt;&gt; m = re.findall('N[^P][ST][^P]',string)
&gt;&gt;&gt; m
['NNTS']
</code></pre>
<p>I don't understand why it didn't yield this output:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; m
    ['NNTS','NTSY']
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<blockquote>
<h3><code>re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)</code></h3>
<p>Return all <strong>non-overlapping</strong> matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group. Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the beginning of another match.</p>

<p>If you're not just trying to understand why, but actually need to get overlapping matches, you can use lookahead with a capturing group as described <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5616822/python-regex-find-all-overlapping-matches">in this question's answers</a>.</p>

<p>This is in fact possible, using a lookahead assertion.</p>
<pre><code>(?=pattern)
</code></pre>
<p>will match at any position directly followed by pattern without consuming the string, and </p>
<pre><code>(?=(pattern))
</code></pre>
<p>will capture the group that matched.</p>
<pre><code>import re
string = 'NNTSY'
m = re.findall(r'(?=(N[^P][ST][^P]))',string)
print(m)
#['NNTS', 'NTSY']
</code></pre>
