<p>When reading and writing pickle files, I've noticed that some snippets use <code>.p</code> others <code>.pkl</code> and some the full <code>.pickle</code>.  Is there one most pythonic way of doing this?</p>
<p>My current view is that there is no one right answer, and that any of these will suffice.  In fact, writing a filename of <code>awesome.pkl</code> or <code>awesome.sauce</code> won't make a difference when running <code>pickle.load(open(filename, "rb"))</code>.  This is to say, the file extension is just a convention which doesn't actually affect the underlying data.  Is that right?</p>
<p>Bonus: What if I saved a PNG image as <code>myimage.jpg</code>?  What havoc would that create?</p>

<p>The <strong>extension</strong> makes <strong>no difference</strong> because "<strong>The Pickle Protocol</strong>" runs every time. </p>
<p>That is to say whenever pickle.dumps or pickle.loads is run the objects are serialized/un-serialized according to the pickle protocol.</p>
<p>(The pickle protocol is a <strong>serialization format</strong>)</p>
<p>The pickle protocol is <strong>python specific</strong>(and there are <strong>several versions</strong>). It's only really designed for a user to re-use data themselves -&gt; if you sent the pickled file to someone else who happened to have a <strong>different version</strong> of pickle/Python then the file might <strong>not load correctly</strong> and you probably can't do anything useful with that pickled file in another language like Java.</p>
<p>So, use what <strong>extensions</strong> you like because the <strong>pickler</strong> will <strong>ignore</strong> them.</p>
<p><strong>JSON</strong> is another more popular way of serializing data, it can also be used by <strong>other languages</strong> unlike pickle - however it does not cater directly to python and so certain variable types are not understood by it :/</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, this is all true, Harry, but I doesn't answer the OP's original question, as I understand it.  The OP has a strong hunch -- correctly -- that there is no <i>technical</i> reason to choose one format over another. But he wants to know if there is a more <i>Pythonic</i> way.  In other words, what would a style guide recommend? I came here to find a suggestion.  Checking the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pickle docs</a>, they use <code>.pickle</code>, but in my experience, I've seen <code>.p</code> and <code>.pkl</code> more. I could not find anything in PEP talking about this explicitly.  :(</span>
