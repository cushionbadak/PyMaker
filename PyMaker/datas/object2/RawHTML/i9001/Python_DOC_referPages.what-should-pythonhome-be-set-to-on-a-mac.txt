<p>I don't have anything set in my .bash_profile for <code>$PYTHONHOME</code>.  What should this be set to?  Can't find anything consistent online to what it should be set to.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You do not need to set <code>$PYHONHOME</code> for python 2.7. Python knows where to find its standard library. If <code>$PYHONHOME</code> is not set, Python defaults to using the directory where python.exe was found, so that dir should be in PATH. </p>
<p>You can read <a href="http://docs.python.org/using/cmdline.html#environment-variables" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Environment variables</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHOME" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PYTHONHOME</a> in Python documentation.</p>
<p>The only reason to set <code>$PYTHONPATH</code> in the system is to maintain directories of custom Python libraries that you do not want to install in the global default location (i.e., the <code>site-packages</code> directory).</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">PYTHONHOME actually points to the directory of the standard library by default (e.g. /usr/local/lib/pythonXX).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It depends on what version of python do you use. I am ok with default one installed through homebrew so I do not have any PYTHONHOME in any of my config files. Which version of python do you use and for what purposes?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I use python 2.7 for command line scripts.</span>
