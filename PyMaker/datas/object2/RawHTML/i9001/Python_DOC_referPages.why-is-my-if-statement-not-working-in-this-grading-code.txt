<p>Instead of returning <code>random.randint(start,stop)</code>, you are printing it.</p>

<p>Your <code>rand</code> function is returning <code>None</code> since it is printing a value, instead of returning it. Also, good practice would be to name it something more descriptive, such as <code>get_random</code> or <code>get_random_number</code>. Also, your <code>get_random</code> function does the exact same thing <code>randint</code> does, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt there (<em>more functionality to be added?</em>).</p>
<p>As a bonus, I've included an example how the little known <code>bisect</code> library is perfect for these kinds of value intersection problems!</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import bisect, random

def get_random(start, stop):
  return random.randint(start,stop)

def match_grade(score):
    breakpoints = [60, 70, 80, 90]
    grades = ["which is a F.", "which is a D.", 
    "which is a C.", "which is a B.", "which is an A."]
    bisect_index = bisect.bisect(breakpoints, score)
    return grades[bisect_index]

random_number = get_random(50, 100)
grade_range = match_grade(random_number)
print "Your test score is {}, {}".format(random_number, grade_range)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Sample Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Your test score is 63, which is a D.
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you need your own function that does exactly the same thing as <code>random.randint()</code>?</span>
