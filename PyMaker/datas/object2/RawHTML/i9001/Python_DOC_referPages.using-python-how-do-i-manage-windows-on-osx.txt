<p>I am trying to manage windows using python.</p>
<p>Specifically I am trying to find a window that I have opened using selenium then have it focused and maximise it. I believe this is possible using a window manager as there are programs like qtile written in python.</p>
<p>I have read on the python documentation that there is something called pythonw.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html</a></p>
<p>I am using python 3.5 but I can upgrade if this is an easier option.</p>
<p>How do I use this on OSX?</p>
<p>Is there a library or are there any more resources on this subject?</p>
<p>I would like to learn how to use simple window management in python for osx.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>You need a system level window manager for this</p>
