<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am very very new to Python so I apologize in advance! I am trying to create a list where the user has the option to add a number, display the mean, display the median, print the list in order, print the list in reverse order, or quit. I thought I was on the right track but I cant get it to run. Can anyone help me?</p>

<h1>Problem with mean</h1>
<p>You got a really good hint from the traceback message: <code>ZeroDivisionError: division by zero</code>. What was the denominator of your division? <code>listLength</code>. Where was <code>listLength</code> calculated from? The length of an empty list (<code>myList</code>) that you created with local scope to the function. You needed the length of the list passed as an argument to the function instead.</p>
<p>There's another problem with your mean calculation also: your numerator isn't correct for the division either. Fixing it is left as an exercise to you.</p>
<h1>Problem with median</h1>
<p>Again, the traceback message gave you a really good hint: <code>AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'median'</code>. Neither the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">common sequence operations</a> nor the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">List-type operations</a> provide a <code>median</code> method. You either need to define it as a function or build a class that defines it as a class method and has a List as internal storage.</p>
<p>Or, you could avoid re-inventing the wheel -- probably the most Pythonic answer of all -- and use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>statistics</code></a> module from the standard library.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You need to be more specific than "I can't get it to run".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have tried copy/pasting this and there's a few things undefined. What is the issue you are having? Should this be a self-contained example?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If I try to choose the option of calculating the mean or calculating the median it blows up. If I try to choose the option print the list either in order or in reverse it just shows an empty set.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If code "blows up" it usually gives a handy trail of errors in a traceback. Can you please include it in your question as an edit? Without even running the code, my editor is showing <code>listMedian</code> as undefined in <code>median()</code>, so I know that will fail to run.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just posted what it says when I try to run the mean and median. Thank you for helping me!</span>
