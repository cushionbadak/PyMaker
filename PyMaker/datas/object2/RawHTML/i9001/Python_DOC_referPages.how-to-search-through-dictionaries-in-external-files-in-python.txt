<p>I'm a little stumped. </p>
<p>I'm learning Python, and I'm trying to make a login sequence. Here's the relevant code I have so far </p>
<pre><code>def login():
   usr = input("Please enter your name:") 
   with open("IDs.py", "r+") as f:
   for line in f:
    for i in line:
    print(line) ##I know that this doesn't work at all I was experimenting with a couple concepts :P 
pas = input("Please enter your password:") 
</code></pre>
<p>The file in question IDs.py would look something like this`</p>
<pre><code>_example = dict([("j5vlK5tO", "TYhx0RJU3")])
_example = dict([("iSWGaTF", "xsR5Q0bnP")])
_example = dict([("l9uJFyiX", "1GgaTJ5H")])
</code></pre>
<p>I'm really noob, so maybe this is really simple? Sorry if it is! Any feedback or suggestions are appreciated, thank you! </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's a python file so you can import dictionaries to use them:</p>
<pre><code>import IDs

print(IDs._example)
#perform operations 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In order to use object from another python file you shouldn't open it and read it as text, you should <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">import</a> the module.</p>
<p>Your <code>IDs.py</code> module could then have a dictionary that looks a little bit like this:</p>
<pre><code>IDS = {'user1': 'password1!',
       'user2': 'Password2#!'}
</code></pre>
<p>And your main file:</p>
<pre><code>from IDs import IDS
if IDS[usr] == pas:
    # Victory!
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Honestly, I kind of thought it might be something along the lines of this(and was hoping) Thanks so much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now to WRITE code to another file would opening it be a good method?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't change code (i.e the text in the file) at runtime by accessing the objects in it. You can generate files using <code>open</code> and write text to them that will be parsable by python's interpreter.</span>
