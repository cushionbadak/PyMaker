<p>I am writing a python application which uses GitHub using PyGitHub library. I have an organization which contains several private repos. I want to invite two different users and give them read-only access to two different repositories.</p>
<p>I have been looking through PyGitHub documentaiton but there doesn't seem to be a way to add an individual collaborator to a repository without making him a part of the team and giving him access to all repositories in the organization.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to do that?</p>

<p>It's no different from any other repository, and is not special for organizations. Get the <code>Repository</code> you're interested in with <a href="https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github_objects/Organization.html#github.Organization.Organization.get_repo" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>get_repo()</code></a> and then use <a href="https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/github_objects/Repository.html#github.Repository.Repository.add_to_collaborators" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>add_to_collaborators()</code></a>.</p>
