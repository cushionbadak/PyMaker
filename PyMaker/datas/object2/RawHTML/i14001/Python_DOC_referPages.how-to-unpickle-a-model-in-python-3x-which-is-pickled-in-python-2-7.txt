<p>I have pickled a model in python 2.7 with following sentence</p>
<pre><code>import pickle
with open('filename','w') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)
</code></pre>
<p>How I am in python 3.X and what to unpickle the model, but get error</p>
<pre><code>'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x86 in position 4: invalid start byte
</code></pre>
<p>The code I tried is:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle
with open('filename','rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f, encoding='UTF-8')
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>You pickle with <code>'w'</code> but you unpickle with <code>rb</code>... So maybe that's the problem... </li>
<li>The other thing I found out: <code>0x86</code> can be decoded using <code>latin-1</code>. So maybe you can try to change this, <em>or both.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I also read in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle docs</a> that the pickle protocoll is automatically detected and should not cause the problem. So it seems to be all about encoding...</p>
