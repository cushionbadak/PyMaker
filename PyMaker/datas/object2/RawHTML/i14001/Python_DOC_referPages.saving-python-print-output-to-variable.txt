<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i'm trying to print a message on the screen and then also save that in a text file, but if i put it into a variable first, then print it, it displays with things like, and () which i don't want. I'm wondering how I would save the print output to a variable, so that i can then write it to a text file.</p>
<pre><code>print("P", count, ": ", "".join(random.choice(chars) for i in range(length)))
</code></pre>
<p>That is what i have the print as, but if i did this:</p>
<pre><code>var = "P", count, ": ", "".join(random.choice(chars) for i in range(length))
</code></pre>
<p>it would display as this V which I dont want it to.</p>
<pre><code>('P ', 314, ': ', 'ZYIAV')
</code></pre>

<p>You're looking for the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings" rel="nofollow">format string syntax</a>.</p>
<pre><code>result = "P {}: {}".format(count, "".join(random.choice(chars) for i in range(length)))
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>result</code> contains the string in the format you desire and can be printed as well.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It would also be worth it to check out the <code>logging</code> module. It can definitely help for the future. <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/howto/logging.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perfect, thanks.</span>
