<p>Inside a python script, I use the <code>difflib.unified_diff()</code> function to receive the differences of two files. Then, following this <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html#a-command-line-interface-to-difflib" rel="nofollow">example</a>, I call the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html" rel="nofollow">writelines</a>() function to write the result on the screen:</p>
<pre><code>diff = difflib.unified_diff( .... )
sys.stdout.writelines(diff)
</code></pre>
<p>Then, I also want to write the differences in a file, but I receive an empty file. Here comes the strange part: if I exchange the order of the two writelines() calls, I get a correct file but empty screen output. The same problem can also be reproduced by just calling the last command twice, like this:</p>
<pre><code>diff = difflib.unified_diff( .... )
sys.stdout.writelines(diff)
sys.stdout.writelines(diff)
</code></pre>
<p>This will print the diff only once.</p>
<p>I suppose that the second time the function continues from the same (i.e. last) "line" of diff and doesn't have anything to write. So, there must be some kind of iterator I have to reset, but I couldn't find what and how...</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>difflib.unified_diff()</code> returns a <em>generator</em>. It only produces the output <em>once</em> when iterated.</p>
<p>If you need to write it out twice, capture the lines in a list first:</p>
<pre><code>diff = list(difflib.unified_diff( .... ))
sys.stdout.writelines(diff)
sys.stdout.writelines(diff)
</code></pre>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/difflib.html#difflib.unified_diff" rel="nofollow"><code>difflib.unified_diff()</code> documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compare <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> (lists of strings); return a delta (<strong>a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-generator" rel="nofollow"><em>generator</em></a> generating the delta lines</strong>) in unified diff format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Bold emphasis mine</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have consumed the generator after the first write that <code>unified_diff</code> returns.</p>
<p><strong>difflib.unified_diff(a, b[, fromfile][, tofile][, fromfiledate][, tofiledate][, n][, lineterm])</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compare a and b (lists of strings); return a delta (a <strong>generator</strong> generating the delta lines) in unified diff format.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to store the output in  a list if you want to use it twice.</p>
<pre><code>diff = list(difflib.unified_diff( .... ))
</code></pre>
<p>Once you iterate over a generator once, it has been consumed so there is nothing to iterate over the second time:</p>
<pre><code>In [13]: gen = (i for i in (1,2,3))    
In [14]: for i in gen:
           print(i)
   ....:     
1
2
3   
In [15]: for i in gen: # already been consumed
           print(i)
   ....:     
</code></pre>
<p>Calling list on  the gen means you store all the lines in a list so you can iterate and use the lines as many times as you need:</p>
<pre><code>In [19]: gen = (i for i in (1,2,3))    
In [20]: l = list(gen)    
In [21]: for i in l:
           print(i)
   ....:     
1
2
3    
In [22]: for i in l:
             print(i)
   ....:     
1
2
3
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you both for the quick answer! You both provided the same solution, though I can only mark one of them as THE solution. :-)</span>
