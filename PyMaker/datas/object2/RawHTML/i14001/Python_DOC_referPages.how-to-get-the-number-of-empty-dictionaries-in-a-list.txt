<p>I have a list that is in this format <code>[['A', 'B'], {}, {}, {}]</code>i'm trying to get the number of empty dictionaries in the list what is the most pythonic way of doing this properly, i've been able to do it but i find myself having to create a temporary list in the process is there a more efficient way of doing this without creating a temporary list?</p>
<pre><code>a = [['A', 'B'], {'test': 'lang'}, {}, {}]
tmp_list = list()

for i in a:
    if isinstance(i, dict):
        if len(i) == 0:
            tmp_list.append(i)

print(len(tmp_list))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As Luke commented, just count it</p>
<pre><code>a = [['A', 'B'], {'test': 'lang'}, {}, {}]
print(a.count({}))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-generator_expression" rel="nofollow">generator expression</a> is handy here, along with the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">sum</a> function:</p>
<pre><code>a = [['A', 'B'], {'test': 'lang'}, {}, {}]
count = sum(1 for x in a if isinstance(x, dict) and not x)
print count
# 2
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you don't need to check <code>len</code> if you just want empty ones; since empty dictionaries evaluate as <code>False</code> in a boolean context, <code>not x</code> is sufficient. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just have a count integer, and increment it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As an aside, it is not idiomatic to have a list whose elements are not all of the same type.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice! I always forget about <code>.count</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Haha, you should try to keep it in mind, it's very practical :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would use <code>x == {}</code>, since if someone has gone to all the trouble of implementing dict-compatible equality, they deserve it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i'm still trying to wrap my head around the code, but is there any benefit of using generators to @Jean Araujo's answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@danidee In this case, not really. The generator-expression version lets you do more complicated things (different conditions, different values, etc.) if you want to, but that's besides the point if all you need is a count of <code>{}</code>s.</span>
