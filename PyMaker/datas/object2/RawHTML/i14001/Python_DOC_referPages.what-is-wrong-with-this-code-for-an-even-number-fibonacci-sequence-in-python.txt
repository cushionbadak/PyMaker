<p>Since this is for <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2" rel="nofollow">Problem 2 of Project Euler</a>, you're computing the wrong values. It asks for the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers up to a <em>value</em> of four million, not the four millionth value. That would be too large.</p>
<p>Since we want to keep generating values, we'll use a generator and combine it with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/itertools.html#itertools.takewhile" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.takewhile()</code></a>. Then we'll <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow"><code>filter()</code></a> it down to the even values, and find the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow"><code>sum()</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>import itertools

def fibonacci_gen():
    first = 0
    second = 1
    while 1:
        first, second = second, first + second
        yield second
</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = fibonacci_gen()
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(filter(lambda y: not y%2, itertools.takewhile(lambda x: x&lt;=4e6, a)))
4613732
</code></pre>
<p>For a solution that doesn't use these features:</p>
<pre><code>def fibonacci_4m():
    result = 0
    first = 0
    second = 1
    while second &lt;= 4e6:
        first, second = second, first + second
        if not second%2:
            result += second
    return result
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fibonacci_4m()

<p><code>second % 2</code> starts off as 1, which is not odd. Consequently your <code>while</code> loop doesn't run anything in the body, so the loop runs forever. </p>
<p>You probably want to always compute the next Fibonacci number, but only increment the count if the <code>second</code> is even. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your problem is that you have your count variable inside the if statement. You have created an infinite while loop. Move it outside of the if statement:</p>
<pre><code>    if(second % 2 == 0):
        first, second = second, first + second
    count +=1
</code></pre>
<p>Also you will have to add more code to make this work properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your while loop, nothing changes when the if statement fails to execute its conditional code. Try the following instead:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    for index in range(1, 41):
        print('even_fibonacci({}) = {}'.format(index, even_fibonacci(index)))

def even_fibonacci(index):
    for number in all_fibonacci():
        if not number &amp; 1:
            index -= 1
            if not index:
                return number

def all_fibonacci():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<span class="comment-copy">As a side-note, in Python you use <code>return first, second</code> to return 2 values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tip: put <code>print(first, second)</code> inside the <code>while</code> loop and observe what happens to the values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What does "even-number Fibonacci sequence" mean? Is it a list of all even Fibonacci numbers up to the given element?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, it looks like this might be <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Problem 2 from Project Euler</a>. If it is, your algorithm and understanding of the problem are incorrect.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's project euler. You're supposed to take as many logical shortcuts as you can :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot you're right it is, however I only just completed the CodeAcademy course, so I'm not familiar with 'yield', 'itertools.takewhile', filter( ) and a few of the other syntax as of yet. Could you simplify the syntax please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I highly recommend learning about them instead. You can find out about <code>yield</code> from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do-in-python?rq=1">the relevant question in the "Related" sidebar</a>, and <code>itertools.takewhile</code> and <code>filter</code> from the links embedded in my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Having a tough time understanding the explanations on Stack Overflow, have you got any other simpler/ detailed explanations, you could refer me to?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kor13, I've added an alternate version that uses more basic operations.</span>
