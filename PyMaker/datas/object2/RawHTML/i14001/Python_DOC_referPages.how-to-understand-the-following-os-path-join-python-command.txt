<p>I have a snippet like the following.</p>
<pre><code>out_dir = os.path.join( dir, "myfile-{0}".format(os.environ['JOB_ID']) )
</code></pre>
<p>I understand os.path.join is used to join one or more path components intelligently. So does that mean "myfile-{0}".format(os.environ['JOB_ID']) is also a path component? Why would that be? Many thanks for your time and attention. </p>

<p>Let's analyze your question:</p>
<pre><code>out_dir = os.path.join( dir, "myfile-{0}".format(os.environ['JOB_ID']) )
</code></pre>
<p>What you already know is: <code>out_dir</code> is a variable name, <code>os.path.join</code> is a method that creates a directory path out of two (or more) strings.
What you're not completely sure about are the arguments of the method: <code>dir</code> being some variable declared before is also clear to you, but the expression <code>"myfile-{0}".format(os.environ['JOB_ID'])</code> is little confusing to you.
<code>myfile-{0}"</code> is a string and and one can call the method <code>format</code> on strings, the zero in the braces <code>{0}</code> is replaced by the first argument, and if there were <code>{1}</code> it would be replaced by a second argument. The return value of <code>os.environ['JOB_ID']</code> is inserted in place of <code>{0}</code>.</p>
<p>Let's say the return value is 1, so this would produce the string <code>"myfile-1"</code>. And let's say the value of <code>dir</code> is <code>"/path/to/the/directory"</code>. Then the variable <code>out_dir</code> is assigned the value <code>"/path/to/the/directory/myfile-1"</code>. Pay attention to the slash <code>/</code>. <code>os.path.join</code> creates the path to the file taking care of the directory separator.</p>
<p>That means  <code>"myfile-{0}".format(os.environ['JOB_ID'])</code> is also a path component.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's just a string. Look up <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.format()</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>"myfile-{0}".format(x)</code> is conceptually the same as <code>"myfile-" + str(x)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know you already answered this question. But somehow I got the following error:  out_dir = os.path.join(dir, "myfile-{0}".format(os.environ['JOB_ID']))   File "/apps/x86_64/python/2.7.6/lib/python2.7/UserDict.py", line 23, in <b>getitem</b>     raise KeyError(key) KeyError: 'JOB_ID' Do you happen to know why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>os.environ['JOB_ID']</code> is trying to get the environment variable JOB_ID.  It has to be declared before the python script runs. You can run the command <code>env</code> in the bash and see if JOB_ID exists.</span>
