<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to turn a nested list of lists (number of lists can be 2 lists +) into a single list of tuples.</p>
<p>The list looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>exampleList = [['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], [1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 30, 40]]
</code></pre>
<p>And I would like for it to be like this;</p>
<pre><code>newList = [('A', 1, 10), ('B', 2, 20), ('C', 3, '30)...]
</code></pre>
<p>I know that if you do <code>zip(list1, list2)</code>, it becomes a list of tuple. But how do I go about doing it for a list of lists?</p>
<p>I tried using the zip concept with:</p>
<pre><code>test = []
for data in exampleList:
     test.append(zip(data))
</code></pre>
<p>But it did not work out for me.</p>
<p>Thanks in advanced for any help!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; exampleList = [['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], [1, 2, 3, 4], [10, 20, 30, 40]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(zip(*exampleList))
[('A', 1, 10), ('B', 2, 20), ('C', 3, 30), ('D', 4, 40)]
</code></pre>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>If you want your output to be a list of lists, instead of a list of tuples,</p>
<pre><code>[list(i) for i in zip(*empampleList)]
</code></pre>
<p>should do the trick</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What's your actual expected output? Exactly <code>newList</code> but where the elements are lists rather than tuples? What's stopping you from doing something like <code>newList = [list(e) for e in zip(*exampleList)]</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look at the manual for zip <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip</a> even the parameter list is shown as <code>*iterable</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Didn't the OP already do this and ask for a list of lists instead of a list of tuples? I know it's trivial to do that once you generate the list of tuples (see my comment), but I don't think this answers the question. Admittedly, it's confusing and I may be misreading it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Two-BitAlchemist: I thought OP was trying to <code>zip</code> the lists contained within a list. But I'll address your comment as well</span>
