<p>I would like to find the Max length for each column in a tab delimited csv file.
I can find the max value of one column by using this:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
oldlen=0
with open(mfile) as csvfile:
test = csv.reader(csvfile,dialect='excel-tab')
for row in test:
    if len(row[0]) &gt; oldlen:
        newlen = len(row[0])
print (newlen)
</code></pre>
<p>If I wish to do all columns (and count them), I could just change row[] manually, but I wish to learn so I tried this:</p>
<pre><code>with open(mfile) as csvfile:
test = csv.reader(csvfile,dialect='excel-tab')
ncol=len(test[0])
for column in test:
    for row in test:
        if len(row[column]) &gt; oldlen:
            newlen = len(row[0])
    print (column,newlen)
</code></pre>
<p>Which, of course, doesnt make programatic sense. But it indicates, I hope, what my intention is. I have to do the columns first so I can get the max length out of each column, across all rows.</p>

<p>You can use a <code>dict</code> to store a column number-&gt;max length lookup and assign to that by looping over each column of each row.</p>
<pre><code>lengths = {}
with open(mfile) as csvfile:
    test = csv.reader(csvfile, dialect='excel-tab')
    for row in test:
        for colno, col in enumerate(row):
            lengths[colno] = max(len(col), lengths.get(colno, 0))
</code></pre>
<p>The number of columns will be <code>len(lengths)</code>, and the maximum length of each will be accessible as <code>lengths[0]</code> for the first column <code>lengths[1]</code> for the second etc...</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7313194/how-would-i-succinctly-transpose-nested-lists">transpose the rows into columns</a> with the <code>zip()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>with open(mfile) as csvfile:
    test = csv.reader(csvfile, dialect='excel-tab')
    columns = list(zip(*test))
</code></pre>
<p>and then get the maximum value per column:</p>
<pre><code>for col in columns:
    print(max(col))        
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It works, but I'm confused over the colno,col  - How does it know to go through columns ? are these reserved words?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jer99 think of a file as an iterable of rows... each row is itself iterable, so iterating over a row, is going through each column in that row... There's no reserved words... you can name them what you want - I opted for <code>colno</code> (column number) and <code>col</code> (column value)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So the list automatically contains and index and a value. So I tried a statement like "...for rowid, row in test:"  and it says there are too many values to unpack (expected 2). Thats a bit confusing to me.  I'm assuming that "test" is a list with a index and value as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jer99 the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enumerate function</a> returns a tuple of index and value... iterating over a list directly only gives the values...</span>
