<p>I have to make my python script read a DNA query strings file and do a search with it.</p>
<p>Well, the file contains this type of character:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AbXn1.png"/></p>
<p>And python default encoding cannot read this line with the readline() function for files. The following error is raised:</p>
<pre><code>[...]
File "/usr/lib/python3.4/codecs.py", line 319, in decode
(result, consumed) = self._buffer_decode(data, self.errors, final)
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x81 in position 860: invalid start byte
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried with utf_16 and ascii too but with no positive results. How can I read this?</p>
</div>

<p>You need to first figure out what the actual encoding of the text file you have to read, then use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow"><code>open</code></a> with that file and the correct <code>encoding</code> argument to open that.  The diamond ? is simply a placeholder character in your console so your default system encoding is incompatible with the file you have displayed (and vice versa).</p>
<p>Alternatively if you do not care about the "junk" characters you can simply <code>'ignore'</code> or <code>'replace'</code> for the <code>errors</code> argument.  Again please consult the documentation first for options available.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you have this line: <code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-</code> on the top of your file (and after <code>#!/usr/bin/python</code> if you have it at the top) ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problematic character is not in the code, is in the file that i have to read</span>
