<p>I'm trying to figure out how to get the exception to show for this function </p>
<pre><code>clone_saved_path():

def clone_saved_path():

            except OSError as e:
                # If the error was caused because the source wasn't a directory
                print('Directory not copied. Error: %s' % e)
                print("got here. [4]")
            except:
                print("Another error occurred in clone_saved_path() ")
                print("got here. [5]")
</code></pre>
<p>When I run my code, it hits the last <code>except</code> block and outputs:</p>
<pre><code>print("Another error occurred in clone_saved_path() ")
</code></pre>
<p>I know this may sound basic, but I need to figure out how to show the <em>actual</em> exception.</p>

"This function returns a tuple of three values that give information about the exception that is currently being handled."</p>
<p>So you could do something like the below (suggested here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions</a>):</p>
<pre><code>import sys
# ...
        except:
            print("Another error occurred in clone_saved_path() ")
            print(sys.exc_info()[0]) # type of exception
            raise 
</code></pre>
