<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a CSV file containing data in the following format without a header:</p>
<p>12345;TO-345;Something;Might be useful as well;etc;44444:33333;and_so_on;</p>
<p>1435;TO-345;Something as well;Definately useful;etc;44444:33333;done;</p>
<p>And the file goes for another 1000 lines or so.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to accomplish with Python is that I want to read the file line by line and be able to call specific columns per line. For example when the column specific for-loop starts with line 0, it could print out the data in column 0 and then continue doing the same for next line all the way to the end of the file (last line).  I have found good examples for similar scenarios but have failed to understand the thing to do exactly what I want.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To extract the information from the file, you could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">csv</a> module.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import csv
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
...   reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=";")
...   for row in reader:
...     print(row)
... 
['12345', 'TO-345', 'Something', 'Might be useful as well', 'etc', '44444:33333', 'and_so_on', '']
['1435', 'TO-345', 'Something as well', 'Definately useful', 'etc', '44444:33333', 'done', '']
</code></pre>
<p>(I took your sample and put it in <code>data.txt</code>)</p>
<p>In the inner loop, you could select any column you want, the rows are just lists of strings. To get the third column youâ€™d print <code>print(row[2])</code> instead of the whole row.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also first load all rows into a list, if you want to loop over it multiple times:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

def load_data(filename):
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=";")
        return list(reader)

data = load_data("data.txt")
for row in data:
    print(row[2])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can start with a simple python code like</p>
<pre><code>file = open('filename', 'r');
for line in file:
    row = line.split(';')
    print(row[1])
file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>This will print second column from each line of file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>print row[0]</code>, <code>print row[1]</code>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you so much Jonas!</span>
