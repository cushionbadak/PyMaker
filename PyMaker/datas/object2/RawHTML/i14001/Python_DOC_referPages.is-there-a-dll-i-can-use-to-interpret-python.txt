<p>So I was thinking it would be awfully convenient to have a Python interpreter DLL, and to what I know, the interpreter is a DLL, but I don't know how to use it/if it can be used that way.</p>
<p>I want to execute python files from Gamemaker Studio through a DLL, (Python 2.7, preferably.) and if I knew the functions of the DLL, I could make the proper GML scripts to do it.</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>It is called <em>embedding</em> the Python interpreter. Read the section on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html" rel="nofollow"><em>extending and embedding the Python interpreter</em></a> of the Python documentation.</p>
<p>You might consider some other interpreter, in particular <a href="http://lua.org/" rel="nofollow">Lua</a>, which is free software, widely used in games, and rumored to be faster, or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/" rel="nofollow">GUILE</a> (also faster, and with a much more powerful and expressive language, <a href="http://schemers.org/" rel="nofollow">Scheme</a>; read also <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/" rel="nofollow">SICP</a>)</p>
