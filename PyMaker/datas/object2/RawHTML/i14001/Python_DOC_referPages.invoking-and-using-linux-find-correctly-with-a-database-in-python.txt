<p>I asked a similar question but left out the database part:</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30990267/implementation-of-the-linux-find-command-in-python">Implementation of the Linux find command in python</a></p>
<p>The problem with most of these answers is that <code>subprocess</code> methods do correctly implement find but only can search within my computer. I'm trying to search in an ftp database and have attempted the following types of things:</p>
<pre><code>find_output = subprocess.check_output('find ~', shell = True) 
</code></pre>
<p>into</p>
<pre><code>find_output = subprocess.check_output('find ' + sitename, shell = True)
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>find_output = subprocess.check_output('find ' + sitename, filename, shell = True)
</code></pre>
<p>among other attempts, but nothing has worked so far. I am trying to search for a specific file or directory within directories and subdirectories in an ftp database and printing out the pathway. Is there a useful method that is not <code>subprocess</code> or is there a way to correctly adapt <code>subprocess</code> to accept the additional arguments (sitename, filename)?</p>

<p>try using a list for the command elements</p>

<p>Re-reading your question you'll want to use an ftp client to connect to the ftp server and look at the files there.</p>
<p>See the Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html" rel="nofollow">ftplib docs</a></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ftplib import FTP
&gt;&gt;&gt; with FTP("ftp1.at.proftpd.org") as ftp:
...     ftp.login()
...     ftp.dir()
...

<p>I think you have a few problems you need to address:</p>
<p>1) As you noted, find on linux execute local to the machine it's run on. 
2) You trying to access a remote FTP file system (I presume).</p>
<p>If you remote system is linux and you want to go through its file system using find, remotely you'll need to connect to that machine. SSH may be a good example. I just modified from one the answer on your original question.</p>
<pre><code>found = subprocess.Popen(['ssh', 'user@host', 'YOUR FIND CMD'],stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
for line in iter(found.stdout.readline, ''):
   print line,

<span class="comment-copy">What is an "ftp database"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have connected to a database using ftp (file transfer protocol) (ftplib). I don't have admin privileges though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But ftp is not a database. It's a means of transferring files between computers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I meant I have access to the database with the python script and can look through it, so essentially I can access the files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry but I don't quite understand both what the final arguments are and what these: (*popenargs, timeout=None, **kwargs) mean. Could you please explain?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>*popenargs</code> means it takes a list of args. <code>check_output</code> calls <code>subprocess.Popen</code> so it passes popen args to it.  See the example above the help which passes a list of args. After re-reading your question it looks like you might want to use Python's ftplib to make the FTP connection and use that to look for your files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If it's possible, could you please include an argument for the file that is being searched for? Or if it isn't needed, could you explain why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This would be dependent on your implementation of find (Where I mentioned YOUR FIND CMD) for instance using ' find / -name "foo.txt" ' would search your system for any file called foo.txt.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And with an ftp server, is the host going to be a url of the ftp site, an ip-address, or something else?</span>
