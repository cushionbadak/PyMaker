<p>I have successfully installed the Azure Command line. Also, python is installed on the server. However, when I run /usr/bin/az command it gives error as follows:</p>
<p><code>Could not import runpy module</code></p>
<p>The output for python version is as follows: </p>
<pre><code>Python 2.7.5 (default, Nov 16 2018, 04:38:38) 
[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-23)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

<p>The issue you are facing generally comes into the picture whenever there's a broken python environment on the host. In most cases, the fix is to re-install the package, but for the Azure CLI, you will have to make some other arrangements. I solved the issue by using the following method: </p>
<p>Step 1: Find the location of your AZ using <code>which az</code> most likely it should be sitting in <code>/usr/bin/</code>. 
<br/><br/>
Step 2: Take a copy of your existing <code>az</code> and copy it to let's say <code>az_copy</code> <br/><br/>
Step 3: Edit the <code>az</code> file using any of the available editors and replace with the following: <br/><br/></p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
#/usr/lib64/az/bin/python -Esm azure.cli "$@"

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/rh/python27/root/usr/lib64
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib64/az/lib/python2.7:/usr/lib64/az/lib/python2.7/site-packages

/opt/rh/python27/root/usr/bin/python2.7 -sm azure.cli "$@"

# -E     : ignore PYTHON* environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
# -s     : don't add user site directory to sys.path; also PYTHONNOUSERSITE
</code></pre>
<p>Post this, save and execute az, it should work. <br/>
Do let me know if that worked out for you. </p>
