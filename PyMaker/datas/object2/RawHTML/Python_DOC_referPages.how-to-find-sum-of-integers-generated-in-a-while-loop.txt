<p>Above is what I have
I would like to print the sum of yes after the loop is done, I tried 
y = yes += yes
print(y) this didn't work    </p>

<p>If you set <code>yes</code> to zero before the loop you can just <code>+=</code> it:</p>
<pre><code>salary = 1000
interest = 0.002 * salary
x = 0
yes = 0
while x &lt; 12:
    yes += 0.15 * salary
    salary += interest
    x += 1
print(yes)

<p>This could be better accomplished in a <code>for</code> loop rather than a <code>while</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>salary = 1000
interest = .002 * salary
x, total_yes = 0, 0

# This will keep track of x for you

    salary += interest
    total_yes += yes

print(total_yes)

<p>I think I would use list comprehension combined with a function:</p>
<pre><code>salary = 1000
interest = 0.002

def sum_yes(salary, interest):
    monthly_interest = 0.002 * salary
    monthly_salaries = [salary + (monthly_interest * month) for month in range(12)]
    return sum([month_salary * 0.15 for month_salary in monthly_salaries])

yes = sum_yes(salary, interest)
print(yes)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>yes+=yes</code> won't work as you are re-initializing the variable yes in the start of the loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should consider using a for-loop since you know the starting and ending index, and increment of the loop</span>
