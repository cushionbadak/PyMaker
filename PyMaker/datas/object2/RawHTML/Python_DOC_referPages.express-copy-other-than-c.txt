<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to add some extra step in my ctrl+C key. Basically, after I press ctrl+C, I will run a python code to process the content on the clipboard and update the clipboard with the processed text so I can paste it out. </p>
<pre><code>^x::

clipboard =   
Sleep, 50
Send, ^c
ClipWait
Sleep, 50

Run "directory\try.py"
RunWait "directory\try.py"

Return
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that I used ^x because I don't want my test hotkey to keep calling on itself. I still want to use ^c to trigger the process, but in that case, I need to express "copy" in another term than "^c". Could someone help me out on this? I tried to google but found no helpful idea. Thanks. </p>

<p>You can use <code>~^c::</code> to trigger your script. The tilde lets the key through, so you don't need to send it separately</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can use <code>Send, ^{Insert}</code> instead of <code>Send, ^c</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried but then my code doesn't work anymore</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why both <code>run</code> and <code>runwait</code>? Probably you want <code>RunWait</code> only. So, put in a <code>MsgBox %Clipboard%</code> before the <code>Runwait</code> then add a <code>sleep  150</code> and another <code>MsgBox %Clipboard%</code> after to make sure the right things are happening.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@LouieLee - @PGilm <code>send, ^{Insert}</code> is the right answer, but if you want an other way to do it, you can think about to make a Counter for example If you click 1x <code>^c</code> then do a action Copy and if you do click 2x <code>^c</code> then do a action Copy+run try.py - you can look to this example <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52522397/autohotkey-3-clicks-volume-mute/52570040#52570040">multiclick</a> - You need only to change the code a little bit <code>~LButton::</code> into <code>^c::</code> and then split your Ahk example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use <code>~^c::</code> to trigger your script. The tilde lets the key through, so you don't need to send it separately</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to add some braces and indenting. As you have it, in AHK, only the MsgBoxes are selectively triggered (first line after the <code>If</code>) and the <code>sendinput ^{insert}</code> will trigger twice, and the uncommented <code>RunWait "directory\try.py"</code> prt will always execute, too.</span>
