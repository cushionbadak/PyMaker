<p>Due to license restrictions I do not want to use QTCharts, so I am looking at <a href="http://www.pyqtgraph.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PyQtGraph</a> library.</p>
<p>I am working with PySide2 and QML. I am having difficulty getting a simple example working using QML because I don't know where to start. How do I embed one of these charts from the Python/Pyside2 backend to the QML front end?</p>
<p>Do I need to use a QQuickWidget somehow? Anyone have any examples of how to do this?</p>
<p>Can someone please point me in the right direction? Thank you</p>

<p>pyqtgraph is based on QGraphicsView which is part of the Qt Widgets submodule, so what you are asking for is equivalent to asking that a Qt Widget be embedded in QML and that is not possible. QQuickWidget does the opposite, ie embed a QML in a Qt Widget. In conclusion you can not.</p>
