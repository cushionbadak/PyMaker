<p>I need to write a program that calculates the cheapest combination of big and small bus to transport a certain number of passengers, which is given by the user. A big bus carries 48 passengers and is $200 to hire and a small bus carries 10 passengers and is $95 to hire. I have a solution that calculates a number of big and small buses but I have no clue how to factor in the cost side of things. This is the code I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>passengers = int(input("How many passengers? "))
bigBus = 0
smallBus = 0


while passengers &gt; 0:
    if passengers / 48 &gt; 1:
        passengers -= 48
        bigBus += 1
    else:
        passengers -= 10
        smallBus += 1

cost = (bigBus * 200) + (smallBus * 95)
print("Hire", bigBus, "big buses and", smallBus, "small buses.")
print("Cost =", cost)
</code></pre>
<p>The division of passengers by 48 in the if statement is the cause of the problem since you can transport less than 48 passengers in a 1 big bus (for example 30) and it would be cheaper than transporting them in 3 small buses, but I have no clue how I would determine the cost to be cheaper in that case. I think the solution is flying right over my head.</p>

<p>Fill as many large busses as possible <code>passengers // 48</code>.  Then for the remaining passengers you have a simple decision to make based on the fact that 3 small busses cost more than 1 big bus (so you won't use more than two small busses):</p>
<p>passengers remaining = <code>passengers % 48</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Between 0 and 20: use 0, 1 or 2 small busses <code>(remaining+9) // 10</code>.</li>
<li>more than 20: use one additional large bus</li>
</ul>
<p>This can be boiled down to :</p>
<pre><code>remaining   = passengers % 48
largeBusses = passengers // 48 + int(remaining &gt; 20)
smallBusses = (remaining+9) // 10 * int(remaining &lt;= 20)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your average cost per passenger is <code>200/48</code> and <code>95/10</code> if the bus is full. Obviously the larger bus is more economic so the best solution comes as you use more large buses. </p>
<pre><code>n_large = 0
n_small = 0

n_large += passengers // 48

# people remain unsettled
# [0, 48]
passengers = passengers % 48
</code></pre>
<p>But you also need to calculate the cost for the last bus because it's not full of people: <code>if 200/num_people_left &gt; 95/num_people_left</code> then use smaller bus for the last a few people.</p>
