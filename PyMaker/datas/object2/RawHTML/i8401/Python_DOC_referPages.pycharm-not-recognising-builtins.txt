<p>I'm using <strong>Python 3.5.2</strong>, <strong>PyCharm Community Edition 2017.1.1</strong> in <strong>Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS</strong></p>
<p>I'm a beginner in Python and I'm trying to get this code to work.</p>
<pre><code>a = getattr(__builtins__, 'print')
</code></pre>
<p>Actually it works fine in IDLE, but Pycharm is not recognising the builtins. Other common builtins functions like str(), int()... are woking fine.</p>
<p>I searched in <a href="https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/206585935-Pycharm-doesn-t-recognize-builtins-for-me-" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pycharm support</a> for solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "Reload" button in Settings | Python Interpreters regenerates the skeletons for binary modules, including builtins. Please try pressing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But its not working too. I get this in Pycharm...</p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'print'
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>You should not directly use the <code>__builtins__</code> and instead use the <code>builtins</code> module. </p>
<p>In the pycharm python console, the <code>__builtins__</code> acts as a dict, which in that case, you will need to retrieve <code>print</code> by <code>a = __builtins__['print']</code>.  In contrast, if you run it as a script, the <code>__builtins__</code> act as the module representation the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>builtins</code>Ã¸</a> module. In that case, you will need to do it your way using either <code>a = getattr(__builtins__, 'print')</code> or <code>a = __builtins__.print</code>. </p>
<p>But as I stated before, you should not directly use the <code>__builtins__</code> keyword. You should do this instead:</p>
<pre><code>import builtins
a = builtins.print # or getatrr(builtins, 'print') which either way you prefer
</code></pre>
