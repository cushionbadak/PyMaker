<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a code that uses functions to calculate the closest edge of a station id based on its geographical coordinates.</p>
<p>The output is a line like this (format xml):</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;edge id="4260662#2" from="1977648762" to="2600872721"/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I need to extract only the id value from this line which is in this example: <strong>4260662#2</strong>, so I tried to use for loop, I put the line in a string named "ch" but when I did "for i in ch:" , it shows me an error:  <strong>TypeError: iteration over non-sequence</strong>.</p>
<p>I tried many solutions but they did not work, can you help me please?<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yLbC7.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yLbC7.jpg"/></a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>closestEdge</code> is an instance of the <a href="https://github.com/planetsumo/sumo/blob/ab65ad20a110c48d500aed65f5c0c100c30528f4/sumo/tools/sumolib/net/edge.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sumolib.net.edge.Edge</code></a> class. It is not a string and can not be treated as such by, for example, iterating over it.</p>
<p>Fortunately the <code>Edge</code> class contains a method, <a href="https://github.com/planetsumo/sumo/blob/ab65ad20a110c48d500aed65f5c0c100c30528f4/sumo/tools/sumolib/net/edge.py#L92" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>getID()</code></a>, which can be used to access the id:</p>
<pre><code>distancesAndEdges = sorted([(dist, edge) for edge, dist in edges])
dist, closestEdge = distancesAndEdges[0]

print(closestEdge.getID())
</code></pre>
<p>On a related note, you do not need to sort the list of edges to find the closest (that with minimum distance). Instead you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>min()</code></a> builtin function with the <code>key</code> argument:</p>
<pre><code>from operator import itemgetter

dist, closestEdge = min(edges, key=itemgetter(1))
print(closestEdge.getID())
</code></pre>
<p>Not only is this code more readable, but <code>min()</code> has time complexity <em>O(n)</em>, which is faster than <em>O(n log n)</em> for <code>sorted()</code>.</p>

About your code, it seems that, contrary to what you seem to think, closestEdge isn't a string, but probably some object....</span>
