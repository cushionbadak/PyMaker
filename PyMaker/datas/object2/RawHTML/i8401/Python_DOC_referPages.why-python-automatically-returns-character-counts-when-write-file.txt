<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I recently noticed that when I have the following code:</p>
<pre><code>File = "/dir/to/file"
Content = "abcdefg"

with open(File,"a") as f:
    f.write(Content)
</code></pre>
<p>I got "7" as an output and it is the count of characters in the variable "Content". I do not recall seeing this (I used ipython notebook before, but this time I did it in the python environment in shell) and wonder if I did something wrong. My python version: Python 3.3.3. Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>As always this behaviour is normal for most <code>.write()</code> implementations, see also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#i-o-base-classes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">I/O Base Classes</a>.</p>
<p>For example <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.RawIOBase.write" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>io.RawIOBase.write</code></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write the given bytes-like object, b, to the underlying raw stream, and return the number of bytes written.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.write" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>io.TextIOBase.write</code></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write the string s to the stream and return the number of characters written.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which <code>IO</code>-class is used depends on (the OS and) the parameters given to <code>open</code>. But as far as I can see all of them return some sort of "characters" or "bytes" written count.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is normal behaviour</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>f.write(string)</code> writes the contents of <code>string</code> to the file, returning the number of characters written.</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickHaugh what you mean by normal behaviour!? Coz, the string is stored into a variable <code>Content</code> and that is being written to the file if I did get the question right. Can you please be more elaborate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is normal and documented behavior. AFAIK, <code>f.write</code> has always worked this way, and works similar to C functions in that sense (e.g. <code>fprintf</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you people for your helpful comment!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much @MSeifert . I've been using ipython notebook and recently switched to directly do it in shell command. In ipython notebook I've never seen such behavior lol.</span>
