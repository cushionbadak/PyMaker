<p>Suppose I have following setup:</p>
<pre><code>import curses

window = curses.initscr()
curses.noecho()

while True:
    k = window.get_wch()
    print("k: ", k)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, according to the documentation, <code>get_wch</code> should return a character on normal characters, and an integer for special keys. However, when I run the above snippet and press, say, arrow up, the loop above fires up three times and gives three separate characters, instead of an integer. The same happens when I use <code>getkey</code>: three characters instead of a multibyte string (as docs say it should return). How do I read a special key? Is it a bug, or do I miss something obvious? I'm running the code on Linux and Python 3.6.1, if it matters.</p>

<p>You output something so it is read in the next loop iteration! Flush/clear the input after you print somethingâ€¦</p>
<pre><code>import curses

window = curses.initscr()
curses.noecho()
window.keypad(True)  # Maybe not perfect, but a good start?

while True:
    k = window.get_wch()
    print(f'k: {k}')
    curses.flushinp()

<span class="comment-copy">The problem is not extra looping, the problem is that I can't read special keys in this manner.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, that was the missing piece. Now it works.</span>
