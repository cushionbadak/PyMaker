<p>I have a Python twisted application whose work is to execute os processes, monitor their life cycle and collect their logs and exit status.
Now I wanted to add a feature which allows child process to notify about it's progress(e.g 50% complete) to parent. How can I enable this communication in best way?
I thought of a rest endpoint in parent where child posts.
Is there any other better way to enable this communication between parent process and child(can be any is process)?</p>
<p>PS: application is written in twisted.</p>

<p>Consider <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.pipe" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.pipe</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#pipes-and-queues" rel="nofollow noreferrer">multiprocessing.pipe and queues</a> to communicate between child and parent processes.

<p>You could also use RabitMQ to do IPC or just <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3290292/read-from-a-log-file-as-its-being-written-using-python">read a file that's being written to</a>.</p>
