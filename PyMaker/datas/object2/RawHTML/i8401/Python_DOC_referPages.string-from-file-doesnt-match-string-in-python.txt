<p>I am trying to read data in from a file in python and compare it to see if it matches some of the information. I have this</p>
<pre><code>with open("data.dat", "r") as f: #read data in from the file
    for line in f:
        if line is "Static": #this adds the data for the static attack
</code></pre>
<p>When I read the data in from my file, it skips right over it. I am at a loss why.</p>
<p>Here is my data.dat file. </p>
<pre><code>Static
0 10
1 50
</code></pre>

<p>You may use <code>==</code> to compare two strings:</p>
<pre><code>with open("data.dat", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        if line == "Static":
</code></pre>
<p><code>is</code> is used to test two objects whether they are the same object (compare identity).</p>
<p><code>==</code> is used to compare two variables' value.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Language Reference - Objects, values and types</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every object has an identity, a type and a value. An object's identity never changes once it has been created; you may think of it as the object's address in memory. The <code>is</code> operator compares the identity of two objects; the <code>id()</code> function returns an integer representing its identity.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For this application, you can use the <code>in</code> operator, like so:</p>
<pre><code>with open("data.dat", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        if "Static" in line:
            # do something
</code></pre>
<p>This is if you want any line with the substring "Static" to be caught by the condition, regardless of whether or not it is the only string in the line. </p>
<p>If you strictly want to catch lines that only have the substring "Static" in it, with the exception of trailing whitespaces, then you can use the <code>==</code> operator, like so:</p>
<pre><code>with open("data.dat", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        if line.strip() == "Static":
            # do something
</code></pre>
</div>
