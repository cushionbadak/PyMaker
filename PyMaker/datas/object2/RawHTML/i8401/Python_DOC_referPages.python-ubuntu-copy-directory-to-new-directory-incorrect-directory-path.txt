<p>I'm trying to write my first Python script, and it is not going well.</p>
<p>I am trying to copy an entire local directory on my Ubuntu machine and place it and its contents in a different on my OS. I did some research and found <code>distutils.dir_util.copy_tree(src,dst)</code> should do just that.</p>
<p>This is the contents of my <strong>backup_images.py</strong> file:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import sys

src = '/nodeGit/code/assets/images'
dst = '/usr/images_backup'

distutils.dir_util.copy_tree(src,dst)
</code></pre>
<p>When I run it, I get error(s) on every line. When I run <code>./backup_images.py</code> in terminal, this is the output:</p>
<pre><code>./backup_images.py: line 1: src: command not found
./backup_images.py: line 2: dst: command not found
./backup_images.py: line 4: syntax error near unexpected token `src,dst'
./backup_images.py: line 4: `distutils.dir_util.copy_tree(src,dst)'
</code></pre>
<p>If I run the same command with sudo (<code>sudo ./backup_images.py</code>), I get completely different errors:</p>
<pre><code>./backup_images.py: 1: ./backup_images.py: src: not found
./backup_images.py: 2: ./backup_images.py: dst: not found
./backup_images.py: 4: ./backup_images.py: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting ")")
</code></pre>
<p>Based on the first couple errors of this, (<code>src: not found</code>,<code>dst: not found</code>), it seems Python isn't able to find the directories I assigned the  <code>src</code> and <code>dst</code> files to. Is this correct?</p>
<p>Because of the changing errors, I'm unsure of how to fix my code.</p>

<p>Don't use <code>distutils</code> to do this. Instead use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copytree" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shutil.copytree()</code></a> to perform a recursive copy of a directory and all its files and subdirectories.</p>
<pre><code>import shutil

src = '/nodeGit/code/assets/images'
dst = '/usr/images_backup'

try:
    shutil.copytree(src,dst)
except shutil.Error as exc:
    # handle any exception that might occur
    print("Got exception {} while copying {} to {}".format(exc, src, dst))

<span class="comment-copy">Looks like you're executing the <code>py</code> script with the bash shell instead of the <code>python</code> binary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that seemed to be the issue. Thanks. Now I'm getting an error, <code>name 'distutils' is not defined</code>, but I'd probably have to open a new Question for that if I'm unable to fix it/find an answer on my own, hm?...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're not importing <code>distutils</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>import distutils</code> wasn't sufficient to fix the error (nothing was imported into the directory on execute)...Am I missing something? I imagine I will want to use <code>distutils</code> in the future</span>
