<p>I have a database containing a table and I want to compute the mean of a column without importing all of the rows and doing it directly in python; I think doing that would take longer (computation-wise and code-wise) than doing it using sqlite. I figured that the following should work:</p>
<pre><code>cursor.execute('SELECT AVG(column) FROM table')
</code></pre>
<p>However, I have no idea how to actually extract the output of this SQL command. I can't find a useful method of the cursor class in the documentation (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html</a>) to help me with this.</p>
<p>Please tell me if what I'm doing makes no sense or is stupid; I have not used SQL before so it might be either of both of the above. </p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Not sure of your other code, but I think you're looking for the .fetchone() method. Something along these lines should work:</p>
<pre><code>import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
c = conn.cursor()
c.execute('SELECT AVG(column) FROM table')
print(c.fetchone())
</code></pre>
<p>.fetchone() method returns one result, if you're looking to return more than one result from an execute you would use a loop like:</p>
<pre><code>for row in c.execute('SELECT * FROM table')
    print(row)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The result has a single column and a single row, but that's not fundamentally different from any other query result.</span>
