<blockquote>
<p>How do I remove "\n"</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that it has to be done in a loop while scrapping so that the data is scraped, "\n" and the unwanted spaces are removed and the data is pushed into the csv.  </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Removing the <code>\n</code> from the individual strings is fairly simple.</p>
<pre><code>line = '\nJob Description\n\nDESCRIPTION:'
line.replace('\n', ' ')
</code></pre>
<p>You aren't very specific about what constitutes 'unwanted spaces' but with the simple assumption that it means two spaces in a row a simple approach would be <code>.replace('  ', ' ')</code> to remove doubled spaces.  Chain the two together and you end up with:</p>
<pre><code>line.replace('\n', ' ').replace('  ', ' ')
</code></pre>
<p>This is both simple and fast.  However it doesn't remove all excess spaces.  For example a sequence of 3 or 4 spaces would become 2 spaces.  Instead you can use a combination of <code>split</code> and <code>join</code> to remove all excess whitespace.</p>
<pre><code>' '.join(line.split())`
</code></pre>
<p>This splits the string at all whitespace (including newlines, tabs and other whitespace) and rejoins them using a single space.  If it does not meet your needs, a regular expression can be used, however regex parsing is not as efficient but is much more powerful.</p>
<pre><code>import re
re.sub('\s{2,}', ' ', line)
</code></pre>
<p>This replaces 2 or more spaces with a single space.</p>
<p>Whichever method you use to clean up a single string, you still need to apply it to each element in the list.  If the method you choose is more complex, you should turn it into a method:</p>
<pre><code>def process(line):
    return line.replace('\n', ' ').replace('  ',  ' ')
</code></pre>
<p>A naive approach would be to rebuild the list with each element processed.  For example using a list generator:</p>
<pre><code>processed_results = [process(line) for line in list]
</code></pre>
<p>With a really large list this can be really inefficient.  The best approach is to use a generator which only processes a single element at a time without rebuilding the entire list.</p>
<pre><code>generated_results = (process(line) for line in list1)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how it looks almost identical to the string comprehension method.  You can iterate through it just like with a list:</p>
<pre><code>for result in generated_results:
    # do something
</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind generators are consumed upon use so if you need to iterate through the results more than once, you may need to use a list instead.  A generator can be turned into a list though simply by doing:</p>
<pre><code>processed_results = list(generated_results)
</code></pre>
<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>The simplest most efficient method would be to use <code>split</code> and <code>join</code> to remove excess whitespace, and use a generator for efficiency to avoid rebuilding the entire list:</p>
<pre><code>generated_results = (' '.join(line.split) for line in list1)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try this:</p>
<pre><code>list2 = [x.replace('\n', '') for x in list1]
</code></pre>
<p>it uses list comprehension to iterate through <code>list1</code> and creates a new list out of the original members with <code>str.replace</code> called on each item to replace the <code>\n</code> with an empty string.  </p>

<p>To remove spaces change the code above to </p>
<pre><code>list2 = [x.replace('\n', '').replace(' ', '') for x in list1]
</code></pre>
