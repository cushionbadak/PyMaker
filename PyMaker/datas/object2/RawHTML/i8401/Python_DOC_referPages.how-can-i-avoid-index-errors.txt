<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to check if each element in the list has a difference of 1. I tried to subtract the element in the list from the previous one but it outputs an IndexError. How edit the code to remove this?</p>
<pre><code>import sys
q = int(input().strip())
for i in range(q):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split(' ')))
    for i in range(len(a)):
        a.sort()
    if a[i+1]-a[i] == 1:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>[i+1]</code> will not work for the last element in the list because you will be going beyond the list bounds. Remember that the length of the list is not the last index in the list, since list indexing starts at 0.</p>
<p>I think you are overcomplicating your problem. Try using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate()</code></a> function, but instead of starting at the first element, start at the second one. With enumerate(), the index will actually be for the element before.</p>
<pre><code>q = [3, 5, 7, 8, 4, 5]
for i, j in enumerate(q[1:]):
    if j - q[i] == 1:
        print("Yes")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">When <code>i</code> is the last index in the array, you can't read from <code>a[i+1]</code> - that doesn't exist.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I never knew about the enumerate function.</span>
