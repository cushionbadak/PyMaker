<p>I am quite new at python.</p>
<p>So I am currently working on a highscore list for a game that I made using tkinter and python. So far I have the code:</p>
<pre><code>from operator import itemgetter
import pickle

playerName = input("what is your name? ")
playerScore = int(input('Give me a score? '))

highscores = [
    ('Luke', 0),
    ('Dalip', 0),
    ('Andrew', 0),
]

highscores.append((playerName, playerScore))
highscores = sorted(highscores, key = itemgetter(1), reverse = True)[:10]

with open('highscore.txt', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(highscores, f)

highscores = []

with open('highscore.txt', 'rb') as f:
    highscores = pickle.load(f)
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is, it puts this into the file:</p>
<p>€]q (X   lukeqK†qX   LukeqK †qX   DalipqK †qX   AndrewqK †qe.
(and yes this is exactly what it looks like)</p>
<p>I don't know what is wrong with it can anyone help, please?</p>

<p><code>pickle</code> produces a binary representation of your data - so it's not supposed to be human readable. </p>
<p>When you load your pickled file, you get your data back, so everything works fine. </p>
<p>If you want a human readable file, a common solution is to use json. See <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#comparison-with-json" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#comparison-with-json</a> for a comparison. In particular:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JSON, by default, can only represent a subset of the Python built-in
  types, and no custom classes; pickle can represent an extremely large
  number of Python types (many of them automatically, by clever usage of
  Python’s introspection facilities; complex cases can be tackled by
  implementing specific object APIs).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You just have to use <code>json</code> instead of <code>pickle</code> in your code:</p>
<pre><code>from operator import itemgetter
import json

try:
    with open('highscore.txt', 'r') as f:
        highscores = json.load(f)
except FileNotFoundError:
    # If the file doesn't exist, use your default values
    highscores = [
        ('Luke', 0),
        ('Dalip', 0),
        ('Andrew', 0),
        ]

playerName = input("what is your name? ")
playerScore = int(input('Give me a score? '))

highscores.append((playerName, playerScore))
highscores = sorted(highscores, key = itemgetter(1), reverse = True)[:10]

with open('highscore.txt', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(highscores, f)

highscores = []
</code></pre>
<p>The content of <code>highscore.txt</code> will look like:</p>
<pre><code>[["thierry", 100], ["Luke", 0], ["Dalip", 0], ["Andrew", 0]]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why is this a problem? By using <code>pickle</code> you're serializing and unserializing your data into a binary format. You're trying to read the file contents of a file that doesn't contain unicode, that's why it looks weird. Does <code>highscores</code> after loading contain the correct information? If so, nothing's wrong.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Thierry it's worked! How do I get it so that once it's added the name to the file it stays there? Because when I re-run the code it gets rid of the score before.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should read the highscores file before entering the new scores. I updated my answer.</span>
