<p>I am trying to run this code but it causes the following error: Error: AudioFileOpen failed ('wht?'). So here's my code-it's running on a Mac and with a folder of mp3 files if that is any help:</p>
<pre><code>import os
def randomShuffleSongFromFolder(folderPath):
    try:
        music = os.listdir(folderPath)
    except:
        print('Error-Music folder not found')
        exit()
    random.shuffle(music)
    music.remove('.DS_Store')
    print(folderPath)
    print(music)
    for song in music:
        os.system('afplay "' + song + '"')
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(os.listdir('/Users/isaac_lims_macbook_air/Desktop/davidMusic'))
randomShuffleSongFromFolder('/Users/isaac_lims_macbook_air/Desktop/MusicExample/')
</code></pre>
<p>Any help is welcomed and greatly thanked</p>

<p>Have a look at this (from your question):</p>
<pre><code>for song in music:
    os.system('afplay "' + song + '"')
</code></pre>
<p>and remember what <code>music</code> contains: a list of file names (e.g. <code>"Adele - Hello.mp3"</code>). When you pass them to <code>afplay</code> you aren't telling it which directory to look in. (Note that the error message is not coming from Python, but rather from <code>afplay</code> itself; e.g. see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14491271/afplay-error-audiofileopen-failed-43">this other question where the same command is called from C</a>.)</p>
<p>Try using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html?highlight=os.path#os.path.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.path.join()</code></a> to include the directory, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>import os.path

# Assuming folderPath is being passed into the containing function as above
for song in music:
    songPath = os.path.join(folderPath, song)
    os.system('afplay "{}"'.format(songPath))
</code></pre>
<p>That way <code>afplay</code> will receive an absolute path like <code>"/Users/you/Desktop/Music/Adele - Hello.mp3"</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It's probably coming from <code>playMusic()</code>, but we have no way to know what that function does. It's definitely not from the standard library.</span>
