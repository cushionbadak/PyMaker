<p>Consider the following <code>python</code> package structure</p>
<pre><code> working_directory/
-- test_run.py
-- mypackge/
---- __init__.py
---- file1.py
---- file2.py
</code></pre>
<p>and say inside <code>file1.py</code> I have defined a function, <code>func1()</code> and I've also imported some functions from numpy with something like <code>from numpy import array</code>. Now I want to import and use <code>mypackage</code> from <code>test_run.py</code> without seeing these numpy functions in the namespace. I want to import it using <code>import mypackage as mp</code> and see</p>
<pre><code>mp.file1.func1()
mp.file2.func2()
etc
</code></pre>
<p>I don't want to see <code>mp.file1.array()</code>. How can I do it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One possibility would be to use underscores:</p>
<pre><code>from numpy import array as _array.
</code></pre>
<p>Although this doesn't prohibit people from accessing <code>mp.file1._array</code> it is a general considered that variables beginning with underscores are 'private'.</p>
<p>AFAIK, there is no simple way to disallow access to any variable in python. (one way would be to make it properties of a class, see: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property</a>)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can't without deleting it, but then the functions in <code>file1</code> won't be able to access it. I have a feeling this is an XY problem. Why do you want to do this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can not do this directly.  If you want to manage the namespace that closely, you will need a stub file at <code>file1</code>, that just imports things you need from <code>file1x</code>, where <code>filex</code> is your current file1, renamed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you don't want to see <code>mp.file1.array()</code>, the correct solution is to not look for it in the first place.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, I would like to make my functions available in an organized form from 'mypackage', and if I need to use some software to implement them I don't want this to be accessible from the outside, because it's unnecessary... Is that wrong?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In principle you are not wrong. However I think this is a battle that is not worth fighting... You could consider making is as clean as possible by using <code>import numpy as np</code> and the <code>np.array</code>. Also, wouldn't you expect the user to look only for functions that you explain in the documentation?</span>
