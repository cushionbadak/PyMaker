<p>I am trying to test how long a http request processing code block takes inside my flask controller, here is the sample code I used:</p>
<pre><code>cancelled = []
t0 = time.time()
t1 = time.clock()   
users = requests.get('https://www.example.com/users/')   
for i in users.json():
    user = requests.get('https://www.example.com/user/%s' % i['id]').json()
    if user['status'] == 'Cancelled':
        cancelled.append(user)
t2 = time.clock()
t3 = time.time()
print t2 - t1
print t3 - t0
</code></pre>
<p>Here are the outputs:</p>
<pre><code>2.712326
76.424875021
</code></pre>
<p>The second output from the time.time() function matches the actual seconds it took to display the results, so I am not sure why the value from time.clock() is so small?</p>
<p>Edit: My system is OSX and python 2.7, and my question is that why is time.clock() generally considered "better" if time.time() reflects the actual time a user experiences/waits?</p>

<p>Note that as of Python 3.3 time.clock is now <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.clock" rel="nofollow noreferrer">deprecated</a> as the behavior is platform dependent. The documentation recommends using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.process_time" rel="nofollow noreferrer">time.process_time</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">time.perf_counter</a> for measuring performance. </p>
<p>Otherwise I would recommend using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">timeit</a> module (especially since this allows you much more control over the testing environment)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What operating system?  <code>time.clock</code> returns the "current processor time".  The docs say "The precision, and in fact the very definition of the meaning of “processor time”, depends on that of the C function of the same name"</span>
