<p>EDIT: The computer in question was a client machine with restrictions on what software could be installed. I'm unsure if that may have been a cause of the issue or if the client's IT department gave the machine a corrupted version of pip. The recommended answers below probably would have worked but were blocked by the company's IT department and required admin login to do. I have since left that project and hope to avoid similar situations.</p>
<p>I'm attempting to install a WHL file</p>
<p>While attempting to run:</p>
<pre><code>import pip
my_path = &lt;a path to the WHL file&gt;
pip.main(['install', my_path])
</code></pre>
<p>I received an Attribute error: </p>
<pre><code>'module' object has no attribute 'main'
</code></pre>
<p>I ran help(pip) and </p>
<pre><code>__main__ 
</code></pre>
<p>was listed as a package content.</p>
<p>I'm running Python 3.4 in the console.</p>

<p>they made a refactoring. you can support both 9 and 10 pip by using:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    from pip import main as pipmain
except:
    from pip._internal import main as pipmain
</code></pre>
<p>and then use pipmain as you used pip.main. for example</p>
<pre><code>pipmain(['install', "--upgrade", "pip"])
pipmain(['install', "-q", "package"])
</code></pre>

<p><code>easy_install --upgrade pip</code> worked for me.</p>

<p>My issue was related to my IDE (PyCharm). older versions of PyCharm does not support pip v10. Upgrading PyCharm solved it for me. </p>

<p>For more recent versions of pip (pip&gt;=10.0.0), the functionality described in the other answers will no longer work. I recommend running the <code>pip</code> with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess</a> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
import sys

my_path = &lt;a path to the WHL file&gt;
command_list = [sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", my_path]
with subprocess.Popen(command_list, stdout=subprocess.PIPE) as proc:
    print(proc.stdout.read())
</code></pre>
<p>This solution uses the current python executable to run the pip command as a commandline command. It was inspired by the solution mentioned <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50255019/6804636">here</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What version of pip do you have? May be worthwhile to run <code>pip install --upgrade pip</code> to make sure you have the most recent version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChristopherApple When running <code>pip install</code> in Powershell I received: <code>ImportError: cannot import name 'main'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Seems like there is some problem with your pip install. Maybe try <code>easy_install pip</code> or <code>easy_install --upgrade pip</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">it worked for me too, thanks! :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you please specify which version of PyCharm you did use to solve this problem</span>
