<p>After updating PyCharm to 2017.1, a new inspection warning started to pop up in a place where everything's seemingly simple and correct. It looks as following:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l6XkA.png" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="Screenshot" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/l6XkA.png"/></a></p>
<p>It looks like <code>open()</code> doesn't return the expected type for <code>file</code> parameter, but the code is pretty straightforward and, most importantly, does work as expected (using Python 3.5.2).</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html" rel="noreferrer">Python docs</a> mention a way using <code>StringIO</code> and it removes the warning indeed, <em>but</em> is it the correct pythonic way to specify output stream for <code>print</code>? If so, why? Is this warning important to follow?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The only solution I found is to type hint PyCharm correctly:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import IO

with open('output_filename', 'w') as f:  # type: IO[str]
    print('some text to go to the file...', file=f)
</code></pre>
<p>This keeps PyCharm happy and does not in any way impede the correct running of your code.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Wouldn't <code>type: IO[str]</code> make more sense? Still silences the PyCharm warning.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you are right...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Isn't the type returned from open is file? Better disable python type check and add a comment in the code with a link to the youtrack:         # noinspection PyTypeChecker         # pycharm complains that f is not of type file but this is a known bug:         # <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-23288" rel="nofollow noreferrer">youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-23288</a></span>
