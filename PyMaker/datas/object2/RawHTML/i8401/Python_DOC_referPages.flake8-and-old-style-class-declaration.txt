<p>I use <code>flake8</code> to check formatting of my python3 scripts. When I declare classes like this...</p>
<pre><code>class MyClass:
</code></pre>
<p>...I get a warning "H238 -- old style class declaration, use new style (inherit from <code>object</code>)".</p>
<p>However, the documentation clearly has declarations just like this: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-definition-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-definition-syntax</a></p>
<p>I think that inheriting from <code>object</code> looks unnecessarily cluttered. Is it functionally different? The documentation doesn't say anything about inheriting from <code>object</code>.</p>
<p>Is this a bug with <code>flake8</code>, or am I just missing something obvious?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is <strong>very</strong> important to install <strong>Flake8</strong> on the <em>correct</em> version of Python for your needs. If you want <strong>Flake8</strong> to properly parse new language features in Python 3.5 (for example), you need it to be installed on 3.5 for <strong>Flake8</strong> to understand those features. In many ways, <strong>Flake8</strong> is tied to the version of Python on which it runs.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">flake8 needs to support both python2 and python3, and the error you're seeing is a python2-ism. Just disable that particular check in your flake8 configuration.</span>
