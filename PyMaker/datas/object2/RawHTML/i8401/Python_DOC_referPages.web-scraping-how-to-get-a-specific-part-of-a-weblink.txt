<p>i have the following link:
<a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jAc7OJyyQboJ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jAc7OJyyQboJ</a>:<strong><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/learn-to-cook" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://cooking.nytimes.com/learn-to-cook</a></strong>+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk</p>
<p>I have multiple links in a dataset. Each link is of same pattern. I want to get a specific part of the link, for the above link i would be the bold part of the link above. I want text starting from 2nd http to before first + sign.</p>
<p>I don't know how to do so using regex. I am working in python. Kindly help me out.</p>

<p>If each link has the same pattern you do not need regex. You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string.find()</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/663171/is-there-a-way-to-substring-a-string-in-python">string cutting</a></p>
<pre><code>link = "https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jAc7OJyyQboJ:https://cooking.nytimes.com/learn-to-cook+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk"

# This finds the second occurrence of "https://" and returns the position
second_https = link.find("https://", link.find("https://")+1)
# Index of the end of the link
end_of_link = link.find("+")

new_link = link[second_https:end_of_link]

print(new_link)
</code></pre>
<p>This will return "<a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/learn-to-cook" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://cooking.nytimes.com/learn-to-cook</a>" and will work if the link follows the same pattern as described (it is the second <em>https://</em> in the link and ends with <em>+</em> sign)</p>

<p>I'd go with <strong><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/urlparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">urlparse (Python 2)</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">urlparse (Python 3)</a></strong>  and a little bit of <strong>re</strong>gex:</p>
<pre><code>import re
from urlparse import urlparse

url_example = "https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jAc7OJyyQboJ:https://cooking.nytimes.com/learn-to-cook+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk"
parsed = urlparse(url_example)
result = re.findall('https?.*', parsed.query)[0].split('+')[0]
print(result)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>https://cooking.nytimes.com/learn-to-cook
