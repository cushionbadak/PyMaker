<p>I would like to call a script inside Python.
I tried os.system but I'm afraid it's not the best option.</p>
<p>Python version 2.3.4</p>
<p>I have the code below:</p>
<pre><code>runScript = (start + ' ' + middle + filename + ' &gt; ' + final + urlFinal + '.log')
os.system(runScript)
</code></pre>
<p>start = /xxxx/xxx/xxxx/_mfgadd.bash</p>
<p>middle, filename, final and urlfinal are arguments for .bash.</p>
<p>Well, when I just tried:</p>
<pre><code>print runScript
</code></pre>
<p>It works perfectly. 
So, what is the best way to execute "runScript"?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I don't think there is a problem doing it your way really, however as Serge mentioned the Subprocess module is more typical:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import subprocess
&gt;&gt;&gt; subprocess.call(['./example.sh'])
</code></pre>
<p>Take a look here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">The recommended way according to the manual of the standard python library is the use of the <code>subprocess</code> module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Subprocess is for 2.4 above and my Python version is 2.3.4. Yeah, i know it is old but I can't update it now.  Is there any alternative?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2287892 In that case i'd use os.system as well. Perhaps mention your python version in the question.</span>
