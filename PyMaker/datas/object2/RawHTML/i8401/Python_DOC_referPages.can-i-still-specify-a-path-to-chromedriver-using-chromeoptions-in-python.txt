<p>I received this error: "WebDriverException: Message: 'chromedriver' executable needs to be in PATH." 
The only way I was able to fix it was to manually add one of the locations of chromedriver like this:</p>
<pre><code>driver = webdriver.Chrome("/Users/anncolvin/.rvm/bin/chromedriver")
</code></pre>
<p>After Chrome launched, I then received this error: "You are using an unsupported command-line flag: --ignore-certifcate-errors. Stability and security will suffer."</p>
<p>I'd like to try using the following code to address this new error but I don't know how/if I can combine it with manually specifying chromedriver's location?</p>
<pre><code>options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_experimental_option("excludeSwitches", ["ignore-
certificate-errors"])
browser = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=options)
browser.get("http://google.com/")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>All you have to do is specify the webdriver location as an argument when calling the Chrome webdriver like so:</p>
<pre><code>chrome_path = r"/Users/anncolvin/.rvm/bin/chromedriver"
browser = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_path, chrome_options=options)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you tell what 'r' is in the path : r"/Users/anncolvin/.rvm/bin/chromedriver"</span>
