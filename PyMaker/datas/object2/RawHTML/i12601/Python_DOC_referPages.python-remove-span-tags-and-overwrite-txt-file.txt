<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to remove span tags from a text document before I ping it, or else it will fail, but I cannot get it to remove the span tags and either save the file again without the tag or save the new results into a array to save.</p>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

with open(r'sitelist.txt') as f:
    f = f.read().splitlines()

soup = BeautifulSoup(f,"html.parser")

while len(soup.find_all('span')) &gt; 0:
    soup.span.extract()

f = soup

return f
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried to decompose or unwrap and cannot get the results I want.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Ah...<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines" rel="nofollow"><code>str.splitlines()</code></a> return a list, you can't just use <code>BeautifulSoup()</code> on a list. Instead, just replace <code>f = f.read().splitlines()</code> with <code>f = f.read()</code>.</p>
<p>And then, your code works, you just need write the output into a file right?</p>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

with open(r'sitelist.txt') as f:
    f = f.read()

soup = BeautifulSoup(f, "html.parser")

while len(soup.find_all('span')) &gt; 0:
    soup.span.extract()

with open(r'sitelist.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(soup))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As said above, you don't need to use <code>readline()</code>, only <code>read()</code>.
I'm not sure if extract works, does it?
Here's my solution, it simply removes span tags(which I think is what you asked):</p>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

with open('sitelist.txt', 'r') as html:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(myfile,"html.parser")
    for match in soup.findAll('span'): 
        match.unwrap()

with open('sitelist.txt', 'w') as html:
    html.write(str(soup))
</code></pre>
<p>I am sure there is a way to opened a file for both reading and writing, but I just open and reopened the file twice.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That is seeming to delete the entire website link creating gaps in the new text document. But I think we are definitely closing in on a solution. Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CBux: Well, because it just removes all <code>span</code> tags from the text file (I think it's a HTML file actually right?). And if this answer is helpful, remember accept it. Please check our <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tour">tour</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help">help center</a> for more details.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If it removes the entire line then it kind of sets me back. Is there a way to save the url but just get rid of the span tag that encloses it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Got it figured out! instead of:     soup.span.extract()  I used     soup.span.unwrap()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CBux: Ah yeah, that is. Happy that you found the solution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead of extract I used unwrap and it removed the tags perfectly. Thanks for the help!</span>
