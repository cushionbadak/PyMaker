<p>I need help to write a program that reads references from one file and searches for their matching record in another file.</p>
<p>If it matches the record it is to print the reference and the title.
If it doesn’t match the record it is to write the reference and “Not Found”.</p>
<p>File 1:</p>
<pre><code>B21212
F12321
C12345
A09876
Q21212
D23234
A12345
</code></pre>
<p>File 2:</p>
<pre><code>A12345,Noddy in Toy Town
B21212,The Famous Five
E98767,Lord of The Rings
C12345,Casino Royale
A09876,Staff Handbook
D23234,Pinky and Perky
</code></pre>
<p>So it will need to find the book id from first file and search for it in file 2.</p>
<p><img alt="The image is the 2 files" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vJn3s.png"/></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd suggest put the content of <code>file2</code> into a dict (very simple, just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow"><code>str.split(',')</code></a>), and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get" rel="nofollow"><code>dict.get()</code></a> method to search it like below:</p>
<pre><code>with open('file2') as f:
    d = dict(i.strip().split(',') for i in f)
with open('file1') as f:
    l = f.read().splitlines()

for i in l:
    print(i, d.get(i, '&lt;Not Found&gt;'))

<pre><code>with open('file2.txt', 'r') as f:
    with open('file1.txt', 'r') as ini:
        _dict = dict(p.strip().split(',') for p in f)
        _list = ini.read().splitlines()

        for key in _list:
            if key not in _dict.keys():
                print key, ' &lt;is not found&gt;'
            else:
                print key, _dict.get(key)

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried anything already? Can you show it to us?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What part do you have problems with? Reading the files? Finding the 'references' in the other file? Writing a new file? Include what you have tried and be more specific about what the problem here is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JennySmith well obviously you start with reading up on how to read a file.</span>
