<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>My goal with this code is that when you put in a certain number, you will get printed the number and some other output, based on what you typed. For some reason, what I have here gives the error "ValueError: incomplete format". It has something to do with the %. What does the error mean, and how do I fix it? Thanks!</p>
<pre><code>variable = "Blah"
variable2 = "Blahblah"

text = raw_input("Type some stuff: ")

if "1" in text:
    print ("One %" % variable)
elif "2" in text:
    print ("Two %" % variable2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>it's expecting another character to follow the <code>%</code> in the string to tell it how to represent <code>variable</code> in the string.</p>
<p>use <code>"One %s" % variable</code> or <code>"One {}".format(variable)</code> to correct the issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; variable = "Blah"
&gt;&gt;&gt; '%s %%' % variable
    'Blah %'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>an easy way:</p>
<pre><code>print ("One " + variable)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It worked. Thank you for helping me out!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Here is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python documentation on this</a> and also a <a href="http://www.python-course.eu/python3_formatted_output.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">very nice tutorial</a>. The tutorial also describes the newer, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>format()</code> style of formatting</a>, but the older <code>%</code> style is still much used because, although less powerful, it is often more convenient.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Curious,  what version of python did you use for this to work, 3x or 2x?  (I am using 2.7.13, where it does not seem to work)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ryyker, I just tested with Python 3.5.2 - works fine. As far as I can tell it <i>should</i> also work for 2.7, according to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10678229/how-can-i-selectively-escape-percent-in-python-strings">this</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this doesn't really answer the question but actually solves the problem I had when stumbling upon this question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or just <code>print("One", variable)</code> which works for both strings and non strings, but only in Python 3.x</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Artyer yeah you right , I used in this way</span>
