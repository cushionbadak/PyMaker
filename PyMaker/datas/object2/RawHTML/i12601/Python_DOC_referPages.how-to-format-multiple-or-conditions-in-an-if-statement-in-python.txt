<p>I am new to Python and am trying to implement multiple 'or' conditions to a single variable. I would like to know and understand the best way to format the following:</p>
<pre><code>if ((word &lt; 1) | (word &gt; 10)):
   print "\n\n\nThe word entered is not valid!"
   print "Words that are valid are 1,2,7,8,9 and 10"
</code></pre>
<p>I want to compare '1' to numbers 5-10. Would it be something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code> if ((word &lt; 1) | (word &gt; 10) and (word &lt; 1) | (word &gt;9) and (word &lt; 1) and etc...):
   print "The word entered is not valid!"
   print "Words that are valid are between 1,2,7,8,9 and 10"
</code></pre>
<p>Numbers 1,2,7,8,9 and 10 are valid. Numbers 3,4,5,and 6 must be checked as less than to the variable of 'word'.</p>
<p>How would i do this?</p>

<p>In Python, <code>|</code> is bitwise-or.  You want:</p>
<pre><code>if word &lt; 1 or word &gt; 10:
</code></pre>
<p>Per the question update, the following is one way to check for a specific set of values:</p>
<pre><code>if word not in (1,2,7,8,9,10):
    print('invalid')
</code></pre>
<p>The equivalent and/or logic would be:</p>
<pre><code>if word &lt; 1 or (word &gt; 2 and word &lt; 7) or word &gt; 10:
    print('invalid')
</code></pre>
<p>But you can see the <code>not in</code> way is simpler.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>if word &lt; 1 or word == 10 or word &gt; 15 or word == 11:
    print 'All will be considered'
</code></pre>
<p>Like mentioned, you can also do.</p>
<pre><code>if word in (1,2,3,4,5,6,7):
    &lt;do something&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>or in range.</p>
<pre><code>if word in range(0,10):
    &lt;do something&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>or will be true if any of them are true.  and will be true if ALL of them are true.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition to @mark-tolonen's answer, there's several ways to check if a <em>range</em> of numbers is less than something. One way would be explicitly using a loop:</p>
<pre><code>less_than_word = True
for i in range(5, 10):
    if i &gt; word:
        less_than_word = False 
        break

print('All values &lt; word: {}'.format(less_than_word))
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can solve it with a combination of <code>all()</code> and <code>map()</code> (which however is harder to read if you are new to python, you can find the docs for <code>all()</code> and <code>map()</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>):</p>
<pre><code>less_than_word = all(map(lambda x: x &lt; word, range(5, 10)))
print('All values &lt; word: {}'.format(less_than_word))
</code></pre>
<p>Yet another alternative would be to check whether the <em>largest</em> element of your sequence of numbers (5-10 in your example) is less than <code>word</code>. If so, they are all less than <code>word</code>, if not, then not.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">First of all <code>|</code> is <b>bitwise or</b> while <code>or</code> is <b>boolean or</b>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is this what you want <code>1 &lt;= word &lt;= 10</code> to be a valid entered number?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">More of comparing the variable 'word' to multiple integers with '1' being the only valid one and anything less than 1 or anything from 5 to 10 being invalid.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and what about 2,3,4,5, &gt;10?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You most likely want to do something like <code>word not in (1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10)</code>, though it really isn't clear at all from your question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In Python, you would prefer to do : <code>if not (1 &lt;= word &lt;= 10):</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@VincentSavard, I don't not think that is false :)  It's really a matter of opinion.  I think the positive logic is more clear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @MarkTolonen</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FalconsFly, you're welcome.  Consider accepting the answer via the check to the left if it answers your question suitably.</span>
