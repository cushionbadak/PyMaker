<p>Is it possible to assign a value and increment the assigned value on the same line in Python? </p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>x = 1
a = x
b = (x += 1)
c = (x += 1)

print a
print b
print c

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I need it in a context where I'm creating an Excel sheet:</p>
<pre><code>col = row = 1
ws.cell(row=row, column=col).value = "A cell value"
ws.cell(row=row, column=(col += 1)).value = "Another cell value"
ws.cell(row=row, column=(col += 1)).value = "Another cell value"
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit 2: Solution:</strong>
It's not possible, but I have created an easy fix:</p>
<pre><code>col = row = 1

def increment_one():
    global col
    col += 1
    return col

ws.cell(row=row, column=col).value = "A cell value"
ws.cell(row=row, column=increment_one()).value = "Another cell value"
ws.cell(row=row, column=increment_one()).value = "Another cell value"
</code></pre>

<p>No that’s not possible in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements" rel="nofollow">Assignments</a> (or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#augmented-assignment-statements" rel="nofollow">augmented assignments</a>) are statements and as such may not appear on the right-hand side of another assignment. You can only assign <em>expressions</em> to variables.</p>
<p>The reason for this is most likely to avoid confusions from side effects which are easily caused in other languages that support this.</p>
<p>However, normal assignments do support multiple targets, so you can assign the same expression to multiple variables. This of course still only allows you to have a single expression on the right-hand side (still no statement). In your case, since you want <code>b</code> and <code>x</code> to end up with the same value, you could write it like this:</p>
<pre><code>b = x = x + 1
c = x = x + 1
</code></pre>
<p>Note that since you’re doing <code>x = x + 1</code> you are no longer using an augmented assignment and as such could have different effects for some types (not for integers though).</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Not a pretty one but you can do something like this.</p>
<pre><code>x = 1
a = x
x = b = x+1
x = c = x+1

&gt;&gt;&gt; print a,b,c 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1,2,3

&gt;&gt;&gt;print id(a),id(b),id(c),id(x)
&gt;&gt;&gt;31098952 31098928 31098904 31098904

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do it using a function,here I use the lambda function. There is no exact python equivalent of <code>++x</code> or <code>x++</code> in c.</p>
<pre><code>inc =lambda t: t+1
x = 1
a = x
b,x=inc(x),x+1
c,x = inc(x),x+1

print a
print b
print c
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Not sure why you would want a function there. The code is equivalent to <code>b, x = x + 1, x + 1</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@poke True indeed. I wrote the first thing I thought of.Well the function can be used for some other complex operation if needed.</span>
