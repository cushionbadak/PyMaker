<p>I’m teaching myself programming, using Python as my initial weapon of choice. </p>
<p>I have learnt a few basics and decided to set myself the challenge of asking the user for a list of names, adding the names to a list and then finally writing the names to a <code>.csv</code> file.</p>
<p>Below is my code. It works. </p>
<p>My question is what would you do differently, i.e. how could this code be improved for readability and efficiency. Would you approach the situation differently, structure it differently, call different functions? I am interested in, and would appreciate a great deal, the feedback from more experienced programmers.</p>
<p>In particular, I find certain parts clunky; such as having to specify to the user the required format for data entry. If I were to simply request the data (name age location) without the commas however, then each record, when written to <code>.csv</code>, would simply end up as one record per cell (Excel) – this is not the desired result.    </p>
<pre><code>#Requesting user input. 
guestNames = input("Please enter the names of your guests, one at a time.\n"\
    "Once you have finished entering the information, please type the word \"Done\".\n"\
    "Please enter your names in the following format (Name, Age, Location). ").capitalize()

guestList.append(guestNames)

while guestNames.lower() != "done".lower() :
    guestNames = input("Please enter the name of your " + guestNumber[number] + " guest: ").capitalize()
    guestList.append(guestNames)
    number += 1

#Sorting the list. 
guestList.sort()
guestList.remove("Done")

#Creating .csv file. 
guestFile = open("guestList.csv","w")
guestFile.close()

#Writing to file. 
for entries in guestList :
    guestFile = open("guestList.csv","a")
    guestFile.write(entries)
    guestFile.write("\n")
    guestFile.close()
</code></pre>

<p>I try to write down your demands:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parse the input string according to its structure (whatever) and save results into a list</li>
<li>Format the result into CSV-format string</li>
<li>write the string to a CSV file</li>
</ol>
<p>First of all, I would highly recommend you to read the a Python string operation and formatting tutorial like <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/strings" rel="nofollow">Google Developer Tutorial</a>. When you understand the basic operation, have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods" rel="nofollow">official documentation</a> to see available string processing methods in Python.</p>
<p>Your logic to write the code is right, but there are two meaningless lines:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>while guestNames.lower() != "done".lower()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>It's not necessary to lower "done" since it is already lower-case.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><code>for entries in guestList :
    guestFile = open("guestList.csv","a")</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Here you open and close the questList.csv every loop, which is useless and costly. You could open the file at the beginning, then save all lines with a for loop, and close it at the end.</p>
<p>This is a sample using the same logic and different input format:</p>
<pre><code>print('some notification at the beginning')

while true:
    guestNames = input("Please enter the name of your " + guestNumber[number] + " guest: ").capitalize()

    if guestNames == 'Done':
        # Jump out of the loop if user says done
        break
    else:
        # Assume user input 'name age location', replace all space with commas
        guestList.append(guestNames.replace(' ', ','))
        number += 1

guestList.sort()

# the with keyword will close the guestFile at the end
with open("guestList.csv","w") as guestFile:
    guestFile.write('your headers\n')
    for entries in guestList:
        guestFile.write('%s\n' % entries)
</code></pre>
<p>Be aware that there are many ways to fulfil your demands, with different logics and methodologies. </p>
