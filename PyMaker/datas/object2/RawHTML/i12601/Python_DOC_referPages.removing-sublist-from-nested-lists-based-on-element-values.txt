<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to remove sublist from nested lists based on elements values.</p>
<pre><code>data = [['1', 'i like you'],
['2', 'you are bad'],
['5', 'she is good'],
['7', 'he is poor']]

negative_words = set(['poor', 'bad'])
</code></pre>
<p>If the second column contains negative words, I would like to remove the sub-lists. So, the desired results are below. Any suggestions?</p>
<pre><code>data = [['1', 'i like you'],
['5', 'she is good']]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I can readily think of two ways.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; data = [['1', 'i like you'], ['2', 'you are bad'],
            ['5', 'she is good'], ['7', 'he is poor']]
&gt;&gt;&gt; neg_words = {'poor', 'bad'}
</code></pre>
<p>Use convert string in the sublist to a set, and then check if it is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set.isdisjoint" rel="nofollow"><code>disjoint</code></a> with <code>neg_words</code>, like this</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [[n, ws] for n, ws in data if set(ws.split()).isdisjoint(neg_words)]
[['1', 'i like you'], ['5', 'she is good']]
</code></pre>
<p>Or simply check if none of words from the string in the list, is in <code>neg_words</code>, like this</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [[n, ws] for n, ws in data if all(w not in neg_words for w in ws.split())]
[['1', 'i like you'], ['5', 'she is good']]
</code></pre>
</div>
