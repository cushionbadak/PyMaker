<p>If I write <code>d = {0: 1, 0: 2}</code>, does Python guarantee the value of <code>d[0]</code>, or is it "undefined behavior"?</p>
<p>(Of course, this isn't something you'd <em>ever</em> write when programming, but this question is mostly out of curiosity. Locally, it seems to always save the value associated with the key's last occurrence, i.e. <code>2</code> here. Maybe it's useful info for some weird code gen situations, though.)</p>

<p>yes, it is well-defined -- last value wins. <code>{0: 1, 0: 2}</code> is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#dictionary-displays" rel="nofollow">dictionary display</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a comma-separated sequence of key/datum pairs is given, they are
  evaluated <strong>from left to right</strong> to define the entries of the dictionary:
  each key object is used as a key into the dictionary to store the
  corresponding datum. This means that you can specify the same key
  multiple times in the key/datum list, and <strong>the final dictionaryâ€™s value
  for that key will be the last one given</strong>.<sup>emphasis is mine</sup></p>

<pre><code>a = {0: 1, 0: 2}
a[0]
2
</code></pre>
<p>It will give the value of highest index in the same or duplicate key's value</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@TigerhawkT3: I don't see the question about <i>literals</i> and whether they are <i>"well-defined"</i> specifically in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34503527/do-keys-that-are-the-same-override-each-other-in-a-dictionary-in-python">your duplicate</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The word "literal" isn't in that question's title, but the body is almost identical except for different variable names.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am not asking <b>if</b> the keys override. I am asking if it's defined <b>how</b> that happens. This is not a duplicate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Re. your last sentence, I found this construct useful when I wanted all the keys and an arbitrary value for each key, though it was a comprehension rather than a literal.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TigerhawkT3: I don't consider it a duplicate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TigerhawkT3: holy wars were started for less (literal holy wars e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raskol" rel="nofollow noreferrer">two fingers vs. three</a>). It is not about how close are the words (questions may be duplicates even if they are formulated completely differently at a glance). It is about the <b>intent</b>. The other question wouldn't change if the dictionary were created dynamically (as I understand it).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the reference!</span>
