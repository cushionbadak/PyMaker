<h2>The problem:</h2>
<p>All in all, I want to remove, take off, get rid off the extra blank line that is contained within a variable which is essentially a line which has been read from a .txt file</p>
<h2>In more detail:</h2>
<p>So the scenario is this:
I have a program which takes data from two .txt files, and combines parts of the data from each file to make a new file with data from both</p>
<pre><code>    search_registration = 'QM03 EZM'
    with open('List of Drivers Names and Registrations.txt', 'r') as search_file, open('carFilesTask1.txt', 'r') as search_av_speed_file, open('Addresses Names Registrations Speeds to Fine.txt', 'a') as fine_file:
        for line in search_file:
            if search_registration in line:
                fine_file.write(line)
        for line in search_av_speed_file:
            if search_registration in line:
                current_line = line.split(",")
                speed_of_car = current_line[2]
                print(speed_of_car)
                fine_file.write(speed_of_car)
</code></pre>
<p>In the second <code>for</code> loop, the program searches the .txt file which has the average speeds for the same numberplate registration as was searched for in the first <code>for</code> loop, and splits the line which has this registration using the commas within the text file:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>QM03 EZM,1.0,1118.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The average speed is '1118.5', as it is the third split of the line.</p>
<p>However...
When writing the line with desired registration from the list shown below it seems to add a newline which I do not want</p>
<p>An example of this list is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CO31 RGK, Niall Davidson, YP3 2GP</p>
<p>QM03 EZM, Timothy Rogers, RI8 4BX</p>
<p>EX97 VXM, Pedro Keller, QX20 6PC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And an example of the output is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IS13 PMR, Janet Bleacher, XG3 8KW</p>
<p>2236.9</p>
<p>QM03 EZM, Timothy Rogers, RI8 4BX</p>
<p>1118.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the speeds of the car are different, one is travelling at <code>2236.9</code> and the other at <code>1118.5</code>, showing the string on the second line of each re-run of the program is the one taken from the second original file (the one with the speeds)</p>
<p>I just want to get rid of this blank line, not within the original file, but within the <code>line</code> variable once it has been read from the file</p>
<p>Please help! I've searched everywhere and have not found anything specific to this problem, Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Instead of writing it straight away to the file, how about first saving it in variables first and writing it at once.You can do it like this,</p>
<pre><code>for line in search_file:
    if search_registration in line:
        str1 = line;
for line in search_av_speed_file:
    if search_registration in line:
         current_line = line.split(",")
         speed_of_car = current_line[2]
         print(speed_of_car)
         str2 = speed_of_car
fstr=" ".join(str1,str2) #further formatting can be done here,like strip() and you can print this to see the desired result
fine_file.write(fstr)
</code></pre>
<p>In this way it will be much easier to format the strings as you want.</p>

<p>Ockhius answer is of course right but to remove unwanted characters at the beginning and end of a string: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=strip#str.strip" rel="nofollow" title="str.strip([chars])">str.strip([chars])</a></p>

<p>Your problem is not the <code>\n</code> (new line character) that magically spawn in <code>line</code>.</p>
<p>It is the <code>write</code> function to write strings to file. Every call of the <code>write</code> starts a new line in the output file. </p>
<p>Maybe you should concatenate output string and write all to the file.</p>
<pre><code>search_registration = 'QM03 EZM'
with open('List of Drivers Names and Registrations.txt', 'r') as search_file, open('carFilesTask1.txt', 'r') as search_av_speed_file, open('Addresses Names Registrations Speeds to Fine.txt', 'a') as fine_file:
    for line in search_file:
        if search_registration in line:
            first = line
    for line in search_av_speed_file:
        if search_registration in line:
            current_line = line.split(",")
            speed_of_car = current_line[2]
            print(speed_of_car)
            out_str = first + speed_of_car
            fine_file.write(out_str)

<span class="comment-copy"><i>line</i> contains the new-line character in it (<code>\n</code>). Thus, before using <i>line</i>, you should strip it from <i>line</i>. Try adding this line:  <code>line = line.strip()</code>. Does it help?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, yes it does - Thanks @Tal J. Levy</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @wolfsgang, this makes sense also, thanks for your advice on how to structure my code also :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This makes complete sense, thanks @Ockhius for your help</span>
