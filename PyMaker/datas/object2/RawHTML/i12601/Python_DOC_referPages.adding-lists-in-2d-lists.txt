<p>We could simplify your code and make it work</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since you are trying to calculate the sum of a list you could use <code>sum</code> method</li>
</ul>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You do not need indeed to know the length of your list, if you will run through it. If you are doing it for indexing, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?#enumerate" rel="nofollow"><code>enumerate</code></a> instead.</p>
<p>And, as The6thSense said, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow"><code>sum</code></a> for calculate each student's list</p>
<p>Tip: Use of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html?#string.Formatter.format" rel="nofollow"><code>format</code></a> makes your code more elegant! :-)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Maybe because <code>total</code> is an int and you can not call <code>[s]</code> on int?...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am so what must I do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>total += marks[s][m]</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that still throws an error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">simply change total to a list ,  <code>total = []</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">that's got it thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want total for student 0 is 58 total for student 1 is 35 total for student 2 is 68</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlanRobinson isn't the output I have given here ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes my mistake wrong indentation</span>
<span class="comment-copy">months=["Jan","Feb","March","April"] temp =[] a = 0 for each in months:     temp = int(input("please enter a number for ",months[a]))     a = a + 1</span>
