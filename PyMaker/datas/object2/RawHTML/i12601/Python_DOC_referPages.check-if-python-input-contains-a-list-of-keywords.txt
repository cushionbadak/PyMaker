<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>AKA the correct version of this:</p>
<pre><code>if ['hi', 'hello', 'greetings'] in userMessage:
    print('Hello!')
</code></pre>
<p>I tried what's showed above but it says it cannot use lists, it must use a single string. Same thing if I set the array to an object/variable. If I use "or" it doesn't seem to work altogether.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If the goal is just to say if any of the known list appears in <code>userMessage</code>, and you don't care which one it is, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow">use <code>any</code></a> with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html#generator-expressions-and-list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">generator expression</a>:</p>
<pre><code>if any(srchstr in userMessage for srchstr in ('hi', 'hello', 'greetings')):
</code></pre>
<p>It will short-circuit when it gets a hit, so if <code>hi</code> appears in the input, it doesn't check the rest, and immediately returns <code>True</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do:</p>
<pre><code>found = set(['hi','hello','greetings']) &amp; set(userMessage.split())
for obj in found:
    print found
</code></pre>
<p>if you are looking for multiple words as well</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also compare multiple elements using Set:</p>
<pre><code>if set(['hi', 'hello', 'greetings']) &lt;= set(userMessage.split()):
   print("Hello!")
</code></pre>
<p>But be careful to use split(), once it will not avoid ponctuation. So, if your userMessage is something like "hi, hello, greetings." it will compare the words against ["hi,", "hello,", "greetings."]</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You want it the other way around.. <code>if userMessage in ['hi', 'hello', 'greetings']:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Translate it logically. If <code>message</code> in some list of messages. No more complicated than that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It follows the same in english.. <code>if item in listOfItems:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the OP wants all keywords in the <code>userMessage</code>, is that right @GabeWeiner ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry I didn't specifiy, I meant if one of them was present print the result</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>set</code> is already a builtin Python type. Just use <code>set(lst)</code>, and then a set intersection is a good way to go for it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, one more thing before I give it a "+1", cause this the correct answer, line one of your code snippet has a SyntaxError due the trailing <code>:</code></span>
