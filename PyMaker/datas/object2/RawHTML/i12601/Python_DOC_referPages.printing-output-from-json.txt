<p>I am still new to python, and brand new to json. I am trying to go through output that is in json. I am not yet sure which fields will need to be printed out, but I do know that two of them will be needed.</p>
<p>How could I change:</p>
<pre><code>import json
from pprint import pprint

with open('out.json') as data_file:    
    data = json.load(data_file)

pprint(data)
</code></pre>
<p>to print out say, field one, and field two? </p>
<p>I figure if I can print field one, and two, I can play around with it until I find the right fields. I imagine this is a derp level question, but being able to print specific fields is what I need to be able to do. </p>

<p><code>json.load</code> is returning python obj (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load</a>) so depending on content of 'out.json' it can be either dict, list or few other types.</p>
<p>In case of dictionary you can go with <code>data['key']</code> or if it's list go with <code>data[index]</code> - where index is <code>1,2,...</code></p>
<p>For looping use <code>for</code> ie for list:</p>
<pre><code>for elem in data:
    print(elem)
</code></pre>
<p>of for dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>for key, value in data.items():
    print(key, value)
</code></pre>

<p>You could have find it easily in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html" rel="nofollow"> python's json documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Here data is a <code>dict</code> type object. You can get any value by using the corresponding key like this:</p>
<pre><code>print data['field'] 
</code></pre>
<p>But it will throw a <code>KeyError</code> if the <code>field</code> key is not present in the <code>dict</code>. For avoiding this issue you can use the <code>get()</code> method.</p>
<pre><code>print data.get('field')
</code></pre>
<p>This will return <code>None</code> in case of missing key.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>print(data['field1'])</code>...!?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you know the name of the field you will like to print --&gt; print data['field_name'] (python 2...) or print(data['field_name']) (python 3)   Once you've loaded the data_file which will become a dictionary and from that you can print any keys you want</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much. I am getting closer.   The out.json looks like: {"success":true,"response":[{"category":"Utility","score":120.0}]}  If I say: print(data['category'])  I get an error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look at your data. 'category' is not a root element but part of 'response' list. So in this cace you should do `print(data['response'][0]['category'])' because 'category' is a part of first element in a list contained in a 'response' key of main dictionary</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. This did it.</span>
