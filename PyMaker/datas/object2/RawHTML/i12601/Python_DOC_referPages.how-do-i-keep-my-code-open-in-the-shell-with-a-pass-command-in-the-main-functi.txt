<p>I'm trying to learn how to build a web browser bot as half learning half project for someone else and I've hit a snag.</p>
<p>The site I'm using as guide has:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
     pass
</code></pre>
<p>Which he claims keeps the shell window open do he can run various functions like get x,y cords of the mouse position and take screen shots. </p>
<p>However when I run my code exactly as he has it in the guide it immediately opens and closes.</p>
<p>What I don't want is something like, "make it so pressing enter closes shell instead", what needs to happen is the window stays open so I can enter various functions.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong? Am I suppose to just import the code in a different shell and run the functions outside it?</p>
<p>The code:</p>
<pre><code>import os   
import time
import ImageGrab

x_pad = 0   
y_pad = 61

def screenGrab():   
    box = (x_pad,y_pad,x_pad+1919,y_pad+970)    
    im = ImageGrab.grab(box)    
    im.save(os.getcwd() + '\\full_snap__' + str(int(time.time())) + '.png','PNG')

def main(): 
    pass    

if __name__ == '__main__':    
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>The guide is: <a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games--active-11117" rel="nofollow">http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games--active-11117</a></p>

<p>You have three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start the intepreter with the <code>-i</code> option, as suggested by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1968182/ulrich-eckhardt">Ulrich</a> in the comments:</p>
<pre><code>python -i my-script.py
</code></pre>
<p>This way, the interpreter will be left open as soon as your script finishes execution and a prompt will be shown.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pdb</code></a>. This is often used for debugging, and has a different interface than the usual Python prompt. If you're not familiar with it, it might not be the best option in your case. Replace <code>pass</code> with these two lines:</p>
<pre><code>import pdb
pdb.set_trace()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/code.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>code</code></a>. This will give you an interface much more similar to the usual Python shell and can be an alternative to <code>pdb</code> if you're not familiar with it:</p>
<pre><code>import code
code.interact()
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>By the way, you were not doing anything wrong per se. The <code>pass</code> statement is not meant to "halt Python and start a prompt", it's just needed as a filler for functions or loops with an empty body.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The last four lines just check if the code was imported or executed directly as first argument given to the Python executable. If executed directly, it calls a function that is empty. In summary, the code does nothing. My advise: Run your code from an existing terminal or use <code>python -i ...</code> to enter interactive mode after execution.</span>
