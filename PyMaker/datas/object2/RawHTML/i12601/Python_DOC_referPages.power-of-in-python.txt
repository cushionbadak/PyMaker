<p>Why is it when:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; b = -1
&gt;&gt; b**2
1
</code></pre>
<p>But:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; -1**2
-1
</code></pre>
<p>If i import the math library, it's no problem.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; from math import pow
&gt;&gt; pow(b,2)
1.0
&gt;&gt; pow(-1,2)
1.0
</code></pre>

<p>From the Python documentation:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#the-power-operator" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#the-power-operator</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The power operator binds more tightly than unary operators on its
  left; it binds less tightly than unary operators on its right. </p>
<p>Thus, in an unparenthesized sequence of power and unary operators, the
  operators are evaluated from right to left (this does not constrain
  the evaluation order for the operands): <code>-1**2</code> results in <code>-1</code>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is related with operator precedence.</p>
<p>Try</p>
<pre><code>(-1)**2
</code></pre>
<p><code>**</code> is being evaluated first and then <code>-</code>. Hence, you got <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p>In case of <code>pow</code> function, <code>-1</code> is being evaluated first.</p>

<p>Since its working on 1 not -1 as a whole. This will give expected result.</p>
<pre><code>(-1)**2
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">add parenthesis (-1)**2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks that worked. How does encapsulating a single number change anything?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because <code>-1**2</code> is grouped as <code>-(1**2)</code>, which of course is just <code>-1</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you don't need the math module to use pow, python have it built-in and with more options too</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You know how <code>-x^2</code> in math means <code>-(x^2)</code>? That applies to <code>-1^2</code> too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is funny because the documentation contains an example that exactly matches the OP's question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for that astro</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, like -(1**2), thank you very much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This isn't as useful as the other answers since it doesn't get into precedence, but I'm baffled as to why it's currently at -2 while the other two are at 3 and 4. This is a helpful answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not sure , but I guess because its identical to @karakfa  comment  and the rest are just overrated</span>
