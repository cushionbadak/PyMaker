<p>I need to print a 2D array like <code>[[A,B],[C,D]]</code> like <code>A B C D</code>.</p>
<p>I've seen lots of ways to print a 1D array using <code>''.join()</code> but nothing for 2d arrays.  How can I do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You will need to "flatten" your 2D array into a 1D list, and then can use the approach you already mentioned (<code>' '.join(mylist)</code>). Without resorting to libraries like Numpy, flattening is most easily achieved using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain.from_iterable" rel="nofollow"><code>chain.from_iterable</code></a> from the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools</code></a> module:</p>
<pre><code>import itertools as it

x = [['a','b'],['c','d']]

print(' '.join(it.chain.from_iterable(x)))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Ah, yea, reshaping didn't even occur to me.  Great, thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem. If you don't want to reshape, you will have to use a (nested) loop. But I think reshaping is more "Pythonic".</span>
