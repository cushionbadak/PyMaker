<p>I am new to python. i am learning some basic stuff. I was doing some operation on python list like this <code>three_lists=[]*3</code> when i execute this piece of code it gives me only one empty list like this<code>[]</code>. Why it is not giving me 3  empty list? some what like this <code>[],[],[]</code> </p>

<p>It says right in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations">Python docs</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>s * n</code> or <code>n * s</code> equivalent to adding <code>s</code> to itself <code>n</code> times</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <code>s</code> is a sequence and <code>n</code> is an <code>int</code>. For example</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [1,2,3]*3
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>This is consistent with other sequences as well, such as <code>str</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'hello'*3
'hellohellohello'
</code></pre>
<p>If you wanted a list of 3 empty lists you could say</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [[] for _ in range(3)]
[[], [], []]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>it doesn't multiply lists it's multiply items inside the list
for example</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = []*3
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
[]
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = [1]*3
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
[1, 1, 1]
</code></pre>

<p>The rules of arithmetic(operators in programming) still apply, you can't multiple with '0' or empty value and get something different, you get the original value that you had before.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">To get the effect you may be expecting, you would need to use <code>[[]]*3</code>.  However, the resulting 3 sublists would in fact all be the same list, so changing one of them would change them all, which you probably wouldn't want.  To get 3 separate sublists, you could use something like <code>[[] for i in range(3)]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">how stupid i am ;) thanks</span>
