<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have implemented the following save function in my program which allows the user to save as a JPEG file whatever he/she draws on the Tkinter canvas with the Turtle. How it is supposed to work is that it first captures the screen and Tkinter canvas and then creates a postscript file based on it. Then it converts that postscript file as a PIL (Python Imaging Library) readable file type, and then the PIL saves the converted file as a JPEG. My save function is shown below:</p>
<pre><code>def savefirst(): 
    # Capture screen and Tkinter canvas
    cnv = getscreen().getcanvas() 
    global hen
    # Save screen and canvas as Postscript file
    ps = cnv.postscript(colormode = 'color')
    # Open a Tkinter file dialog that allows to input his.her own name for the file
    hen = filedialog.asksaveasfilename(defaultextension = '.jpg')
    # Convert Postscript file to PIL readable format
    im = Image.open(io.BytesIO(ps.encode('utf-8')))
    # Finally save converted file as a JPEG
    im.save(hen + '.jpg')
</code></pre>
<p>However, whenever I run this save function, I get the error shown below:</p>
<pre><code>line 2396, in savefirst
    im.save(hen + '.jpg')

</code></pre>
<p>even though I already have GhostScript installed! I know this because I first installed it through the Disk Image located <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/" rel="nofollow">here</a> and ran the installer. However, since that did not work, I then did this in <strong>Terminal</strong>: </p>
<pre><code>`pip install ghostscript`
</code></pre>
<p>and since even that did not work, I then ran this in Terminal:</p>
<pre><code>`conda install --channel https://conda.anaconda.org/mlgill ghostscript`
</code></pre>
<p><strong>I used <em>3 ways</em> to install GhostScript and still keep getting the same error. Why is that and how else would I solve this issue?</strong></p>
<p>FYI: Just in case you need to know, my operating system is Mac OS 10.11.2 and my Python version is 3.5.1</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> So, as a comment once said, try to solve this using Homebrew. So, naturally I installed it (since I did not have Homebrew already installed). Then, upon successful installation, I ran <code>brew install ghostscript</code>. After a few kinks I solved, I was able to successfully install GhostScript (well, according to Homebrew anyways). Then I ran <code>brew doctor</code> and found out it was unlinked! ****Gasp**** Well, a fix is easy enough, just link it! So, that is just what I did, and after fixing a few other kinks, I was finally able to successfully execute <code>brew link ghostscript</code>. However, despite my heroic, bodacious attempts at fixing the error, it remained... Yep, despite my best efforts, the error in IDLE when I run my save function <strong>still occurs!</strong> Additionally, running <code>gs</code> in Terminal returns:</p>
<pre><code>dyld: Library not loaded: /opt/X11/lib/libXt.6.dylib
  Referenced from: //anaconda/bin/gs
  Reason: image not found
Trace/BPT trap: 5
</code></pre>
<p><strong>What is STILL going wrong? Why can't Python (or even Terminal) find <code>gs</code>?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>EDIT # 2:</strong> Okay, so I have finally been able to install GhostScript <strong>using Homebrew</strong>. All I had to do was install xQuarts, which GhostScript apparently needs. HOWEVER, <strong>my initial issue is STILL not fixed!</strong> <code>gs</code> now works in Terminal:</p>
<pre><code>:~ #######$ gs

This software comes with NO WARRANTY: see the file PUBLIC for details.
</code></pre>
<p>But my <strong>save function</strong> STILL does not work in Python, and now I am SURE I have GhostScript installed! I still keep on getting this error in IDLE whenever I run my save function:</p>
<pre><code>FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'gs'
</code></pre>
<p><strong>What is still going wrong?</strong></p>
<p><strong>EDIT # 3:</strong> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_2bdLwzG0cHUXF5WmRFRVF1MGc/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is my Python script, just in case it is needed.</p>
<p>-<strong><em>EDIT # 4 Removed</em></strong>-</p>
<p><strong>EDIT # 5:</strong> I have a small hunch this is important, so I am putting it out there. Whenever I run <code>brew doctor</code> in Terminal, I get warnings that are not important, but this one stands out to me for some reason. I really don't know why, but anyways, here it is:</p>
<pre><code>Warning: Python is installed at /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework

Homebrew only supports building against the System-provided Python or a
brewed Python. In particular, Pythons installed to /Library can interfere
with other software installs.
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe this is what is causing my issues? If so, how would I fix it?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT # 6:</strong> Apparently it works for others (both windows AND Mac), but still NOT FOR ME! I STILL keep on getting this error whenever I run my program's <code>savefirst()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>line 2395, in savefirst
    im.save(hen + '.jpg')
  File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages/PIL/Image.py", line 1646, in save

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'gs'
</code></pre>
<p>It's REALLY weird because <code>gs</code> WORKS in Terminal AND this:</p>
<pre><code>x=subprocess.Popen(['/usr/local/bin/gs', '--version'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
print(x.stdout.read())
</code></pre>
<p>works in Python IDLE. But for some reason, Python Imaging Library (PIL) still <strong>CANNOT</strong> detect <code>gs</code> (maybe because of its subprocess.Popen() function?). Why is that? <strong>I have xQuarts, GhostScript, and PIL all installed on my Macintosh</strong>, but I <strong>still get the error when I run my <code>savefirst()</code> function! <em>Why?</em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>P.S. This is all occuring on Macintosh (OS 10.11.2), so answers from those proficient with Macintosh are preferred!</strong></p>
<p>-<strong><em>EDIT # 7 Removed</em></strong>-</p>
<p><strong>EDIT # 8:</strong> Okay, I have finally been able to PERMANENTLY (hopefully...) add <code>/usr/local/bin/gs</code> to my PATH (as you can see below):</p>
<pre><code>Library/usr/local/bin/gs:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin://anaconda/bin:/Users/Rohan/anaconda/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin
</code></pre>
<p>I added that path by running <code>pico ~MyName/.bash_profile</code> and then entering:</p>
<pre><code>PATH="Library/usr/local/bin/gs:${PATH}"
export PATH
</code></pre>
<p>into the <code>/.bash.profile</code> file. However, I STILL keep getting that <code>FileNotFoundError</code> in Python! Did I append <code>/usr/local/bin/gs</code> to my PATH the wrong way, or even in the wrong directory? <strong>If that is not the case, then <em>why can't the Python Imaging Library STILL find <code>gs</code>??</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>EDIT # 9:</strong> Hurrah! Issue RESOLVED! The error does NOT appear anymore. All I had to do was REMOVE <code>/usr/local/bin/gs</code> from my Mac Path, and apparently add it instead to my PYTHONPATH, like so at the beginning of my program:</p>
<pre><code>os.environ["PATH"] += ":/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin/gs"
</code></pre>
<p>Huzzah! It works! PIL can now find <code>gs</code>, and can save the canvas as  JPEG, although it is in a very low resolution, but that is an issue for another question. For now, I am just glad the initial issue is resolved and I can finally save the canvas as a JPEG (Thanks to @Copperfield!) :)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>just a idea: checking in the <a href="https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/master/PIL/EpsImagePlugin.py" rel="nofollow">code</a> of PIL, it use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html?highlight=shutil.which#shutil.which" rel="nofollow">shutil</a> module to find <code>gs</code> doing <code>shutil.which("gs")</code> maybe you need to modify some environment variable until until that work? </p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>talking in the chat room, we find what appear to be the problem, and that is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html?highlight=subprocess.popen#subprocess.Popen" rel="nofollow">subprocess.Popen</a> can't find <code>gs</code>, but we got stuck there. Any ideas??</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong></p>
<p>I found a posible solution, first I remove <code>gs</code> from my path, and I try this</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os,shutil,subprocess

</code></pre>
<p>to make this work with your code the following changes I made: </p>
<pre><code>#this is very first import
import os
print("## Addind gs to environ ##", os.environ["PATH"] )
os.environ["PATH"] += ";C:\\Program Files\\gs\\gs9.18\\bin"
print("## Addind gs to environ ##", os.environ["PATH"] )

#then the others import, and everything else
</code></pre>
<p>and testing it work fine.</p>
<p>In your case that maybe is: </p>
<pre><code>#this is very first import
import os
print("## Addind gs to environ ##", os.environ["PATH"] )
os.environ["PATH"] += ":/usr/local/bin" 
print("## Addind gs to environ ##", os.environ["PATH"] )
#then the others import, and everything else
</code></pre>
<p>is that don't work try with one of this</p>
<pre><code>os.environ["PATH"] += "Library/usr/local/bin" 
os.environ["PATH"] = "/usr/local/bin:" + os.environ["PATH"]
os.environ["PATH"] = "Library/usr/local/bin:" + os.environ["PATH"]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong></p>
<p>as this solution work, a more automatic version of this can be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>#this is the very first thing to do
import os, subprocess, shutil
#see is gs is avaible
if shutil.which("gs") is None:
   print("GhostScrip is not avaible, search for it")
   try:
      gs = subprocess.Popen(["which","gs"],stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
      gs_path = gs.stdout.read()
      gs_path = gs_path.decode() if isinstance(gs_path,bytes) else gs_path
      print("GhostScrip found in",gs_path)
      os.environ["PATH"] += ":"+ os.path.dirname(gs_path)
   except Exception as e:
      raise Warning("GhostScrip not found, this program may fail")

del subprocess
del shutil

#then everything else

<span class="comment-copy">You need to install ghostscript, not the python library for ghostscript. Open a terminal a type <code>gs</code> and hit the enter key, do you get an error message?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your <code>PATH="Library/usr/local/bin/gs:${PATH}"</code> line doesn't look right: I think that should be <code>PATH="/usr/local/bin:${PATH}"</code>. (Items in the <code>PATH</code> should refer to directories, not files). Also, what happens when you run <code>which gs</code> in the terminal?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">After you make that change in your <code>.bash_profile</code>, try typing "set | grep PATH" and see if it has taken effect. (If you haven't logged out and logged back in, then it might not have taken effect yet.) Then try again to run <code>python3</code> and do <code>shutil.which("gs")</code>. Also do <code>print(os.environ("PATH"))</code> and see what that gives you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Glad you fixed it! A couple more things you should know. 1) <code>PATH</code> and <code>PYTHONPATH</code> are not the same thing. <code>PATH</code> is the set of directories where the OS (and Python) will look for <b>executable</b> files, like <code>gs</code>. <code>PYTHONPATH</code> is the set of directories where Python will look for <b>importable</b> modules. When you use <code>subprocess.Popen()</code>, the <code>PATH</code> is what gets searched for the program you want. When you use <code>import modulename</code>, the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> is what gets searched for the module you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And 2) you shouldn't put filenames in your <code>PATH</code>; they'll just clutter it up uselessly. <code>PATH</code> is a list of <i>directories</i>, not files. So your <code>os.environ["PATH"] += ":/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/bin/gs"</code> line should just be <code>os.environ["PATH"] += ":/usr/local/bin"</code>. Try that, and you'll see that it works exactly the same: the <code>/usr/local/bin/gs</code> entry was just cluttering the thing up to no benefit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe...I don't know. The <code>savefirst()</code> function works for the person who answered at the very bottom of the answer list, but it still does not work for me. I really don't know why...I tried my best, but it just is not working..._<i>sigh</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you can look at my latest edit and tell me whether or not what <code>brew doctor</code> is displaying is normal?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I run <code>shutil.which("gs")</code>, it returns nothing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">then that is the root of all you problem, I think. Try puting the folder where gs is in the PATH environment variable and try againg</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How would I do that? Or do I just copy and paste the <code>gs</code> folder to <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5</code>? (I honestly do not know much about the Mac command line. I am WAY more proficient in Python).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How would I find out if I have Xquarts already installed or not?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">usually lives in /opt/x11, but it depends on how you installed it. theres an xQuartz application sitting in /opt/x11/bin for me. You can try a <code>locate xQuartz</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">this also seems to suggest to use xQuartz with ghostscript <a href="http://forums.scribus.net/index.php?topic=1195.0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">forums.scribus.net/index.php?topic=1195.0</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have now successfully installed GhostScript (with x11) and it now works in Terminal (see Edit # 2). However, my initial issue is <b>still not fixed</b>. I keep on getting the same Python IDLE error whenever I run my program (shown in my post).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, I did that, but I get an <code>AssertionError</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">As you can see in my post, I have already installed ghostscript. However, I am now trying to install xquarts. Hopefully that will work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Post the complete python source. My guess is that you need to specify the full path to gs in the call to it, as python has a different PATH than you think it does,</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python is apparently located in <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework</code>. Is that an issue?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So how would I specify the full path to <code>gs</code> in my function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Post your python script in your question and I'll have a look</span>
