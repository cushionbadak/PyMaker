<p>I'd like to tag some files on my Mac with Finder under a certain color tag, and then be able to get that list of files using a Python or bash script. Is it possible to get the list of tags associated with a file via the command line or a Python script?</p>

<p>It's possible.</p>
<p>But you'll have to rely on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xattr.1.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">xattr</a>, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xattr" rel="nofollow noreferrer">xattr-lib</a> should do the trick.<br/>
Some examples have already been made on how to use the <code>xattr</code> command line tool, those can be found here:</p>

<p>I hope these help you out.<br/>
In worse case you could use a tool called <a href="https://github.com/jdberry/tag" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tag</a>:</p>
<pre><code>tag -l file # list
tag -a tag1 file # add
tag -s red,blue file # set
tag -r \* file # remove all tags
tag -f green # find all files with the green tag
tag -f \* # find all files with tags
tag -m red * # match (print files in * that have the red tag)
</code></pre>
<p>This in combination with say <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess.Popen</a> could solve your needs.</p>

<p>Late to the party here, but this is something that has been bugging me too â€” and I eventually came up with a run-round for tech-shy people that requires no line-command coding, just ordinary Finder commands and SimpleText. Try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>open a Finder window containing the tagged files and Select All</p></li>
<li><p>right-click on the selected files to get Contextual Menu and choose "Copy [x number of] files". If it doesn't say "Copy [x number of] files" but just "Copy [filename] you've accidentally deselected the files; reselect all, and try right-clicking again.</p></li>
<li><p>open SimpleText. Make sure that it is set to use Plain Text and NOT Rich Text. (Menu Bar: Format&gt;Make Plain Text/Rich Text). If it is set to Rich Text, this technique will not work: you will get a document containing the actual files rather than a list of their names!</p></li>
<li><p>paste. This should paste a list of the <em>filenames</em> of all selected files, one per line, in the order in which they appear in the Finder. Hurrah!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this works for you. It changed my life.</p>
