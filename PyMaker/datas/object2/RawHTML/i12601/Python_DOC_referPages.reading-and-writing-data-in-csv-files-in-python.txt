<p>I am new to Python and I am having some problems with CSV files in Python. Please help me out</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How do I open and read csv files in Python which are present in some other directory? I know we can do</p>
<pre>
import csv 
f = open('attendees1.csv')
</pre>
<p>As long as my program file and csv file is in the same directory. But how do I provide a link to the csv file sitting in another directory?</p></li>
<li><p>I have a list with multiple rows and columns, how do I transfer this data to a csv file and save it down in a particular location?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Please help me out</p>

<p>First argument of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow"><code>open()</code></a> is file, which can be an absolute path like <code>C:\Program Files\file.csv</code> or a relative one like <code>../../file.csv</code> here <code>..</code> refers to the directory above the current directory and <code>.</code> refers to the current directory.</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open('../path/to/file.csv', 'w') as f:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(f)
    csv_writer.writerows(your_row_data)
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>your_row_data</code> is a list of lists.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can specify the whole path in the open statement. E.g.: f = open('C:\\mypath\\myfile.csv') or f = open('..\\other_path\\myfile.csv') if you are on Windows.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Kotlet,  Can you help me with the 2nd query as well?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can transfer your data with the csv.writer . Please see: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It would help to know the version of Python (2 vs. 3) and whether you need to handle non-ASCII input/output. The <code>csv</code> module is quirky, and requires the original file to be opened in different ways on Py2 vs. Py3. Use the <code>csv</code> docs appropriate to your Python version (kotlet gave the link for Py2, and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Py3 <code>csv</code> docs are here</a>).</span>
