<p>I'm trying to read function calls and values from raw_input and run them on a list. i've made a list that i'm calling the functions on, and a list to hold the raw_input. My issue is getting the function calls from the list called cmd to be called on the original list, called 'l'. for instance, if the value of cmd[0] is 'append', and the value of cmd[1:] is [6,7,8], i want to call 'l.append(6,7,8)'. </p>
<p>this is where i keep getting the error, on the % string stuff.
print(l.'%s(%s)' % (cmd[0], cmd[1:])) </p>
</div>

<p>Just printing out the function to STDOUT does not call it. Consider using Pythons built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow"><code>exec()</code></a> which supports dynamic execution of Python code.</p>
<p>To use <code>exec()</code> just pass a string to it, which is parsed as a suite of Python statements which is then executed. Your string consists of an object <code>l</code>, a method <code>append()</code> which is stored in <code>cmd[0]</code> and the methods arguments <code>args</code> held in <code>cmd[1:]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>exec("{object}.{method}({args})".format(object="l", method=cmd[0], args=cmd[1:]))
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">here is the section i'm working on:                                                            'n = int(raw_input())  l = []  for i in range(1,n+1):     cmd = raw_input().split(' ')     print(l.'%s(%s)' % (cmd[0], cmd[1:])) '</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which version of Python do you use? <code>raw_input()</code> is Python 2.x syntax but on the other hand <code>print()</code> indicates Python 3.x</span>
<span class="comment-copy">python3, that should be just input(), i think.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it's already a big help and i haven't solved the problem yet. at least i know where to go! i'm trying to use python3, but i keep slipping in remnants of 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, If you want you can except this answer if it was helpful for you. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">okay, just did. i appreciate your help, i'm kind of a noob at this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks :) Does your code work now ? ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Works like a charm! Thanks for your help.</span>
