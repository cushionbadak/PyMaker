<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to connect to an FTP server in a python script. I can access the FTP server from the browser without issue, but when I try to run the following:</p>
<pre><code>ftp = FTP('garner.ucsd.edu')
ftp.cwd('pub/products')
</code></pre>
<p>it fails with <code>error_perm: 530 Please login with USER and PASS.</code></p>
<p>But I don't have a username and password for this FTP--how come my browser seems to get past this authentication just fine?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It turns out that Firefox was automatically authenticating with empty strings for the username and password.</p>
<p>These are the default arguments in <code>ftp.login</code>, so the following fixes the script:</p>
<pre><code>ftp = FTP('garner.ucsd.edu')
ftp.login()
ftp.cwd('pub/products')
</code></pre>
<p>This is actually in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html" rel="nofollow">Python documentation</a> too, I just didn't realize it was actually necessary.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It shouldn't be 2 days, it should be 15 minutes</span>
