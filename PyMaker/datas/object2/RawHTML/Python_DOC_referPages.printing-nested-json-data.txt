<p>I am new to programming. I am working with some data that I got using the requests library.  I saved the response to a separate file.  The response has a lot of company information that I don't want to print.  I only want certain types of company data.</p>
<p>The problem I am having is with a nested key/value.  I can access the key/value "Years in Business" from the first company in the list just fine, but the issue is that the key/value from the first company in the list is being copied for each company in the data file.</p>
<p>Here is the data (modified for this post) I'm working with:</p>
<pre class="lang-json prettyprint-override"><code>{

<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import json

with open('company_info.json', encoding='utf8') as file:
    company_data = json.load(file)

for key in company_data['result'][0]['info']:
    print('Company Name: ' + key.get('company_name'))
    print('Country Name: ' + key.get('country_name'))
    print('Date Founded: ' + key.get('date_founded'))
    print('Years in Business: ' + company_data['result'][0]['info'][0]
    ['add_info'][0]['years_in_business'])

<p>Here is the output:</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should iterate for <code>'years_in_business'</code> just like the others:</p>

<p>you can use <code>enumerate</code> to access to the <code>index</code> and <code>value</code> of your list element at the same time:</p>
<pre><code>for index, key in enumerate(company_data['result'][0]['info']):
    print('Company Name: ' + key.get('company_name'))
    print('Country Name: ' + key.get('country_name'))

    ['add_info'][0]['years_in_business'])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you ned to extract that value from list from keys on same level so other key dict keys are</p>
<pre><code>for key in company_data['result'][0]['info']:
    print('Company Name: ' + key.get('company_name'))
    print('Country Name: ' + key.get('country_name'))

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To print the information for all the companies, you iterate of the list of them using  something like this:</p>

for company in company_data['result'][0]['info']:
