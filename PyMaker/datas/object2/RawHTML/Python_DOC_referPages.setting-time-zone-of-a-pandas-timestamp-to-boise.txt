<p>I want to read in a unix time into a timestamp and assign the timezone of Boise. Current timezone there is "MDT â€“ Mountain Daylight Time (Daylight Saving Time)". It will switch to MST during winter time. </p>
<p>What is the right timezone to use, when I want want to have it not dependent on summer / winter time?</p>
<p>I want to have something like this</p>
<pre><code>pd.Timestamp(1513393355, unit='s', tz='US/Pacific') 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This interprets <code>1513393355</code> as a timestamp in UTC and then converts the timestamp to the <code>America/Boise</code> timezone:</p>
<pre><code>In [57]: pd.Timestamp(1513393355, unit='s', tz='UTC').tz_convert('America/Boise')
Out[57]: Timestamp('2017-12-15 20:02:35-0700', tz='America/Boise')
</code></pre>
<p>Pandas depends on <code>pytz</code> for timezone calculations. <code>pytz</code> depends on the Olson database. The Olson database contains a history of the utc offsets for each timezone. So you don't have to worry about whether Daylight Savings Time is in effect on a particular date. <code>tz_convert</code> will take care of that for you.</p>

<p>There is a <code>US/Mountain</code> timezone, but it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones" rel="nofollow noreferrer">deprecated</a>.

<p>A few things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Generally speaking, one should use <code>America/Denver</code> for most of US Mountain Time, which currently switches between MST (UTC-7) and MDT (UTC-6).</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>America/Phoenix</code> for the part of US Mountain Time that does <em>not</em> currently use DST, such as applies in most (but not all) of Arizona.</p>
<ul>
<li>However, be aware that it <em>used</em> to have DST in the past, last in 1968.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Use <code>Etc/GMT+7</code> if you need a fixed offset that is UTC-7 and <em>never</em> had DST.  Be aware that the sign of the offset is inverted intentionally (<code>Etc/GMT+7</code> = <code>UTC-7</code>).</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using this zone for anything other than times for ships at sea, then you should probably re-evaluate this decision.  In other words, if your data is for a local time zone that <em>does</em> use DST, then you should not pick a zone that ignores it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You can use <code>America/Boise</code>, but you should only use it for the areas of southern Idaho and eastern Oregon that started DST four weeks late in 1974 (<code>1974-02-03</code> instead of <code>1974-01-06</code>), as described in <a href="https://github.com/eggert/tz/blob/2018i/northamerica#L781-L787" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the commentary of the TZ Database sources</a>:</p>
<pre><code># Southern Idaho (Ada, Adams, Bannock, Bear Lake, Bingham, Blaine,
# Boise, Bonneville, Butte, Camas, Canyon, Caribou, Cassia, Clark,
# Custer, Elmore, Franklin, Fremont, Gem, Gooding, Jefferson, Jerome,
# Lemhi, Lincoln, Madison, Minidoka, Oneida, Owyhee, Payette, Power,
# Teton, Twin Falls, Valley, Washington counties, and the southern
# quarter of Idaho county) and eastern Oregon (most of Malheur County)
# switched four weeks late in 1974.
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>If you aren't working with timestamps from 1974, then you can ignore this zone and just use <code>America/Denver</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You <em>can</em> use <code>US/Mountain</code>, but understand that it is linked as an alias of <code>America/Denver</code> and is considered deprecated.  It exists for backwards compatibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is generally recommended to use canonical identifiers of the <code>Area/Locality</code> form instead of these older representations.  Refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list of TZ Database time zones</a> on Wikipedia.</li>
</ul></li>

<span class="comment-copy">Awesome - that was exactly what I was looking for. 'US/Mountain' works like a charm.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OMG - did not know that it's so complex. Thanks for your comprehensive answer. My use case are current dates. So I will switch to "America/Boise".</span>
