<p>What is the convention for naming interfaces and abstract classes in Python? PEP 8 doesn't discuss this. For example, in Java, interfaces are often named with an "I" prefix. In PHP (prior to namespaces), abstract classes are typically named with an "_Abstract" suffix.</p>
<p>(I realize that Pythonists are not keen on interfaces, and perhaps this is the reason why I can't find much consensus on this topic. But the usage of interfaces and abstract classes is not my question.)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think naming an interface with an <code>I</code> prefix is perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p>e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>IFoo

IPublishable
</code></pre>
<p>A few years back I used Zope Interfaces. I noticed most codebases used this convention. Our team did too.</p>
<p>We preferred IFoo vs. FooInterface or IFooInterface</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any community-wide standards in that regard apart from <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="noreferrer">PEP8</a>, which doesn't address this specifically. I'd suggest to do whatever your team is most comfortable with, but above all else <em>be consistant</em>.</p>

<p>I would look towards the number tower (from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html" rel="nofollow"><code>numbers</code></a>), the collection ABCs (from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html" rel="nofollow"><code>collections.abc</code></a>), or the other core ABCs (such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib.abc" rel="nofollow"><code>importlib.abc</code></a>) for the most "Pythonic" way to do this.</p>
<p>The consensus from this is to just name them as-is, and let human understanding recognize them as abstract.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">They are the same as typical classes. As far as I am aware of, there aren't any additional rules to it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've been programming in Python since 2.2, and I have not seen any widely used conventions for either of these.</span>
