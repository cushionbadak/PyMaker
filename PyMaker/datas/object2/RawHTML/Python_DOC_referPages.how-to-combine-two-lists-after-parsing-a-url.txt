<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am very new with python. I have a csv with 60 rows with the following format</p>
<pre><code>Sku;url
</code></pre>
<p>I separate them to a url list, I parse the urls and print the results to an output csv. I use multiproccessing and a pool.</p>
<p>But I want to place in front of my results the corresponding SKU of the url</p>
<p>How can I do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since you did not provide details, only thing I can suggest is to keep sku and url together.</p>
<p>Very roughly,</p>
<pre><code>def parse_url_and_save_with_sku(url, sku):
    # code that you did not share here
    # does samething except, it utilizes sku to save with corresponding result

lines = list(open("data.csv"))
data_dict = {}
for line in lines:
    separated = line.split(";")
    sku = separated[0]
    url = separated[1]
    parse_url_and_save_with_sku(url, sku)
</code></pre>
<p>Hope it helps</p>
