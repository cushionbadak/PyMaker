<p>I am currently developing a terminal tool which analyse the output of an command. 
I write the tool in python.
Now I would like to start my tool as an argument within every command, example: <code>python program.py -analyse</code></p>
<p>In this case, <code>python program.py</code> is the command and I would like to start my own project <code>anaylse.py</code> with the argument <code>-analyse</code> which analyse the output from the project and writes its own output to a file. Now my question:</p>
<p>How do I get to start my own program <code>analyse.py</code> from the argument <code>-analyse</code> and how can I catch and read the output from <code>python program.py</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Adding -analyse as an argument will pass it to program.py.  I don't think that is what you are looking for.  I think you are looking for <code>python program.py | python analyse.py</code>.  Then just read the output from stdin.</p>
<p>Throw <code>#!/usr/bin/python</code> at the top of analyse.py and change the permissions to executable to make it simpler yet: <code>python program.py | analyse.py</code></p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">argparse</a> is the standard library module for dealing with command line arguments. I'd advise that you structure your script arguments in the following way:</p>
<p>Choose a character, say <code>f</code>, to indicate the name of the script you wish to run through your tool. This would be called in the following way:</p>
<p><code>python program.py -f analyse.py</code></p>
<p>Then you can use <code>argparse</code> to simply execute the file specified after the <code>-f</code> argument and do whatever you wish with the output.</p>
