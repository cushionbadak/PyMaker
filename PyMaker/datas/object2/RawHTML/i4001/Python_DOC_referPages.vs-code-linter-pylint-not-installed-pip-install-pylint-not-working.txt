<p>So I just started with <strong>Python in VS Code</strong>.
I have installed Python 3.6.5, and the extension for Python on VS Code.
But when I try to save my files, this appears
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4GEAH.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4GEAH.png"/></a></p>
<p>So I do the pip install pylint command, but it does this:

<p>Basically, what this means is that it does not recognise <em>"pip"</em>, how do I fix this? I've been searching for answer but I could not understand anything.</p>

<p>I would try this. Under the View menu select Command Palette. This opens up a window to enter VScode commands. In the command palette look for the command 'Python: Enable Linting'. This allows you to toggle between on or off for linting. Next look for 'Python: Select Linter' lets you chose pylint or another module for linting.</p>
<p>After setting these you should be good to go...
And you should have the Python extension installed.  The name is the one word: Python.  pylint is installed with this extension. Your pip problem may be unrelated.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">But anyway, going by what's in your question: if you don't have <code>pip</code> on your PATH, but do have <code>python</code> (or <code>Python.exe</code>, or whatever), that's exactly why <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/#basic-usage" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a> recommend <code>python -m pip install</code> in place of just <code>pip install</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried doing it, but it does the same error with m+ pip install. It said that -m was not recognised.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">PS C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Coding&gt; -m pip install -m : Имя "-m" не распознано как имя командлета, функции, файла сценария или выполняемой программы.

<span class="comment-copy">You need to include the <code>python</code>. And the <code>pylint</code>. It's <code>python -m pip install pylint</code>, not <code>-m pip install -m</code> or <code>m+ pip install</code> or any other such thing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If I try to select a linter, it makes the "Linter pylint is not installed" error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The extension doesn't come with <code>pylint</code>. It <i>does</i> offer to install it if you don't have it—but the OP clicked that button, and it produced the error in his question. And the error is because of his <code>pip</code> problem, as you can see from the output.</span>
