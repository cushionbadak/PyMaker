<p>Suppose we write the following inside of <code>test_script.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sys.exit(-992340374290374)

<p>We get the following error message:</p>

<p><code>-1</code> is not <code>-992340374290374</code>. What happened?</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit" rel="noreferrer"><code>sys.exit</code> docs</a> (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exit from Python. This is implemented by raising the SystemExit
  exception, so cleanup actions specified by finally clauses of try
  statements are honored, and it is possible to intercept the exit
  attempt at an outer level.</p>
<p>The optional argument arg can be an integer giving the exit status
  (defaulting to zero), or another type of object. If it is an integer,
  zero is considered “successful termination” and any nonzero value is
  considered “abnormal termination” by shells and the like. <strong>Most systems
  require it to be in the range 0–127, and produce undefined results
  otherwise.</strong> Some systems have a convention for assigning specific
  meanings to specific exit codes, but these are generally
  underdeveloped; Unix programs generally use 2 for command line syntax
  errors and 1 for all other kind of errors. If another type of object
  is passed, None is equivalent to passing zero, and any other object is
  printed to stderr and results in an exit code of 1. In particular,
  sys.exit("some error message") is a quick way to exit a program when
  an error occurs.</p>

<p>This has to do with how your operating system handles the exit. In the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> for <code>sys.exit</code> it says: </p>
