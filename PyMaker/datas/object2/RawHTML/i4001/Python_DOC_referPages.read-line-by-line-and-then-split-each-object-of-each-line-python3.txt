<p>I am starting using python and lately, I have been struggling with python. I have the following txt document:</p>
<pre><code>A001 A001.bam A001.bai
A002 A002.bam A002.bai
A003 A003.bam A003.bai
A005 A005.bam A005.bai
A006 A006.bam A006.bai
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to read each line and create a list of list. Such as:</p>
<pre><code>[[A001 A001.bam A001.bai][A002 A002.bam A002.bai][A003 A003.bam
 A003.bai][A005 A005.bam A005.bai][A006 A006.bam A006.bai]]
</code></pre>
<p>Then, I would like to separe each object of each line. Kind of following this example:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>a,b,c = x.split(“,”)</p>
<p>a
      ‘blue’</p>
<p>b 
      ‘red’</p>
<p>c
      ‘green’</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So it would end up looking kind of:</p>
<pre><code>a 'A001'
b 'A001.bam'
c 'A001.bai'
</code></pre>
<p>This is as far as I have arrived:</p>
<pre><code>file = open("path_to_file/file.txt")
map = file.read().splitlines()
samp = []
for line in map:
    samples = line.split(" ")
    samp.append(samples)
    samp[line].split(" ")
print(samp)
</code></pre>
<p>But it does not work and I am getting very confused. Could someone help this beginner?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> with your keys to create a list of objects from your file:</p>
<pre><code>with open('test.txt') as f:
  arr = [dict(zip(['a', 'b', 'c'], line.split())) for line in f]

print(arr)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[{'a': 'A001', 'b': 'A001.bam', 'c': 'A001.bai'}, {'a': 'A002', 'b': 'A002.bam', 'c': 'A002.bai'}, {'a': 'A003', 'b': 'A003.bam', 'c': 'A003.bai'}, {'a': 'A005', 'b': 'A005.bam', 'c': 'A005.bai'}, {'a': 'A006', 'b': 'A006.bam', 'c': 'A006.bai'}]

<p>I believe that you were wanting to maintain it as a list of lists to do that you just need to remove one line from your code.</p>
<pre><code>file = open("path_to_file/file.txt")
map = file.read().splitlines()
samp = []
for line in map:
    samples = line.split(" ")
    samp.append(samples)
print(samp)
file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>But you can simplify it a bit by doing this as you can directly loop through the lines of a file:</p>
<pre><code>with open("filename") as file: 
    samp = []
    for line in file:
        samp.append(line.split(" "))
    print(samp)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I suggest you to take a look at <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pandas</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">BTW, it's not a good idea to use <code>map</code> as a variable name because that "shadows" the built-in <code>map</code> function. It won't hurt anything in your current program, but it would result in a mysterious error message if you tried to use the <code>map</code> function later in your program.</span>
