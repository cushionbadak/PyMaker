<p>I am trying to write a dictionary to a csv file in python.
I've tried nearly every tutorial that I could find but did not get a good result yet.
I want to later edit that file in excel but it looks like this right now:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aElEH.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aElEH.png"/></a></p>
<p>My python code:</p>
<pre><code>s = file_name
dict = App.get_running_app().get_widget_contents()

with open(s, 'w') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    for row in dict.items():
        writer.writerow(row)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What I need is that the key is in column A, and the values are in
  column B. </li>
<li>Furthermore each row should be used instead of every second
  row. </li>
<li>It would be nice to remove the "," between the key and the
  value.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I am very happy if someone could help me with this.</p>

<p>you can go with</p>
<pre><code>s = file_name
dict = App.get_running_app().get_widget_contents()

with open(s, 'w') as f:

    for key in dict:

<span class="comment-copy">Please include an example of <code>dict</code> that gives some of the results. I'm not sure where those strings of lists are coming from - are they to be split into their own columns? Also, are you on Windows? Is this Python 2 or 3 (changes how you get rid of the blank lines). And finally, it's not a good idea to call your own variables <code>dict</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you give an example of your  <code>dict</code> ? This should be possible with <code>csv</code> native library: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This will write each value in a separate row. you might want to append each value of a given key into a list, and then join that list with commas and write it once as a row</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah that works, thank you! :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are welcome :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please accept ans if it solved your problem. Thanks</span>
