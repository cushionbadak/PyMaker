<p>I am executing an external executable from python using the <code>subprocess</code> module. And every time i am sending the input to the executable using the <code>communicate( )</code> method of subprocess. </p>
<pre><code>self.handler = subprocess.Popen([exec_file] , stdout=subprocess.PIPE , stdin=subprocess.PIPE) ; 
self.handler.communicate(self.input_string.encode()) ; 
</code></pre>
<p>Apparently i want execute the same exe for thousands to hundreds of thousands of times for my project. What's the fastest or best way to do this  </p>
<ul>
<li>I want to send input to it and not worry about output . </li>
<li>I want to execute it many times and the input keeps changing every time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider using coroutines from the asyncio library with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-subprocess.html#asyncio.create_subprocess_exec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">create_subprocess_exec</a> function. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you have the source code for the executable?  Seems it would be preferable to get it to loop itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ya ofcouse i have done the same , but what i want is a fastest optimised one , i think there might be a better way to do this ? I am trying to get the time taken by the program to give the output . So , anything which helps to reduce the time spent on things other than the time for processing the input i give , is helpful .</span>
