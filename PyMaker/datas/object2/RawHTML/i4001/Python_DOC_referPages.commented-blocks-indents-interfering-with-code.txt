<p>The problem is best explained by just showing the code:</p>
<pre><code>a = True
b = True
while True:
    """
    A
    """
    if a == True:
        pass
    """
    B
    """
    elif b == True:
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>The issue being that there is a syntax error at "elif b", though when removing the comments, the issue disappears. I tried removing the indents on the comments which resulted in an expected indent on the closing comment line after "A". I know I could switch to using "#" to comment sections, though """ makes things much clearer and is more convenient for large chunks. Perhaps I'm missing something obvious, I would appreciate any help.</p>

<p>String literals aren't comments. You can sometimes sort of pretend they're comments, but they're not, and the fact that they're not is finally biting you.</p>
<p>An <code>elif</code> has to appear immediately after the end of the block associated with the preceding <code>if</code> or <code>elif</code>. There can be comments and whitespace in between, but no statements, and strings count. Use real comments, with <code>#</code>.</p>
<p>If you <em>really</em> want to keep pretending strings are comments, you can indent the B string into the body of the <code>if</code>, but it won't line up cleanly with the block it's intended to be a comment on, and you'll just keep having to mess with your formatting to patch up the differences between comments and string literals.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're creating a new string when you use <code>"""triple quotes"""</code>.  So, you essentially have an un-indented block of code before your elif, which requires a preceding if statement.  The improper tabbing on the quotes ends your <code>if</code> block.  Once your parser reaches the <code>elif</code> block, it doesn't have a matching if block, hence the error.</p>
<p>Triplequotes are used as docstrings in places, and can act like comments, but they're not actually comments.</p>
