<p>In Java, for example, one can say:</p>
<pre><code>public void do(/*when*/time, /*subject*/principal){...}
</code></pre>
<p>or, similarly, when refactoring:</p>
<pre><code>public void do(/*when*/time, /*principal*/){...}
</code></pre>
<p>Does Python have an equivalent facility whereby one can comment not a whole line, but just a part of it such that interpreter doesn't get confused?</p>
<p>If so, what are the shortcut keys to activate this functionality in PyDev and PyCharm?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>No, but you can break your code into multiple lines and use it this way:</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
   return {'foo':'bar',
           #'bar':'baz',
           'boo':'faz'}
</code></pre>
<p>Same logic applies to function parameters and anywhere u can break code into multiple lines.</p>

<p>Valid python comments are:</p>
<pre><code># this is the first comment
spam = 1  # and this is the second comment
          # ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
''' multi-line 
comment using 3 quotes '''
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Comments in Python start with the hash character, <code>#</code>, and extend to the
  end of the physical line. A <strong>comment may appear at the start of a line
  or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal</strong>. A
  hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since
  comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by <code>Python</code>.</em></p>

<span class="comment-copy">It does not.  Python only has single-line, <code>#</code>-to-EOL comments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a> recommends a maximum line length of 80, I don't think it is very pythonic to include comments in the same line of a command.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Even PEP-8 acknowledges that longer line lengths are fine for your <i>own</i> code; the shorter lengths are only required for code being added to the standard library.</span>
