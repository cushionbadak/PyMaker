<p>I'm currently working on a Python project and I would like to know how to split string with space delimiter. For example, </p>
<p><code>"I'm a test"</code> would be <code>["I'm", "", "a", "", "test"]</code>.
So if anyone know how to do it, please help me.</p>
<p>Have a good day !</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.split()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import re
re.split("( )","I'm a test")
</code></pre>
<p>This gives :</p>
<pre><code>["I'm", ' ', 'a', ' ', 'test']
</code></pre>
<p>split works this way : (from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>)
    Split string by the occurrences of pattern. 
    <strong>If capturing parentheses are used in pattern</strong>, then the text of all groups in the pattern are also returned as part of the resulting list.</p>
<p>So here since the space was places inside the capturing parenthesis, it was also returned as a part of the list.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> : If the string had multiple spaces, and you do not want individual spaces to be separate elements of the list, use : (suggested by @NPE)</p>
<pre><code>re.split("(\s+)","I'm    a test")
#["I'm", '    ', 'a', ' ', 'test']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try :</p>
<pre><code>list =  'Im a test'.split()
</code></pre>
<p>Python split string by default by spaces.</p>
<p>The output will be:</p>
<pre><code>list = ['Im','a','test']
</code></pre>
<p>It's mean that you need only add space element between each element in list.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<pre><code>temp_list=  'Im a test'.split()
list= []
for i in temp_list:
    list.append(i)
    list.append('')
list = list[:-1]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>"I'm a test".split()</code> would get you pretty close and seems like a good starting point. (It won't preserve the delimiters though.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NPE Yes I know that, it is the first thing I tried but it doesn't keep space delimiter and I need it for what I'm making.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@GamingActivity where is your <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice answer, but please explain how this works (in particular, the significance of the capturing group). Also, please consider replacing <code>( )</code> with <code>(\s+)</code>. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NPE added it !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your answer but I aldready know that, it is the first thing I tried but it doesn't keep space delimiter and I need it for what I'm making.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok but do you know to add space between words ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GamingActivity fixed :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since you're using <code>list.append('')</code> it appends only a single space, even for sentences with multiple spaces between the words. Would you not like to retain each of those spaces?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I understood from the question he wanted to separate words. But i'm not sure right now.</span>
