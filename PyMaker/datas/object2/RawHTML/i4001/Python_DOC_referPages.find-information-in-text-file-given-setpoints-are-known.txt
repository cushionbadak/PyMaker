<p>So I know the setpoints <code>&lt;start point&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;end point&gt;</code> in the text file and I need to use these to find certain information between them which will be used and printed. I currently have <code>.readlines()</code> within a different function which is used within the new function to find the information.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try something like this:</p>
<pre><code>flag = False
info = [] # your desired information will be appended as a string in list
with open(your_file, 'r') as file:
   for line in file.readlines():
       if '&lt;start point&gt;' in line: # Pointer reached the start point
           flag = True
       if '&lt;end point&gt;' in line: # Pointer reached the end point
           flag = False
       if flag:  # this line is between the start point and endpoint
           info.append(line)

&gt;&gt; info
['Number=12', 'Word=Hello']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This seems like a job for regular expressions. If you have not yet encountered regular expressions, they are an extremely powerful tool that can basically be used to search for a specific pattern in a text string. </p>
<p>For example the regular expression (or regex for short) <code>Number=\d+</code> would find any line in the text document that has <code>Number=</code> followed by any number of number characters. The regex <code>Word=\w+</code> would match any string starting with <code>Word=</code> and then followed by any number of letters. </p>
<p>In python you can use regular expression through the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re module</a>. For a great introduction to using regular expressions in python check out <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter7/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this chapter</a> from the book <em>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</em>. To test out regular expressions <a href="https://regex101.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this site</a> is great. </p>
<p>In this particular instance you would do something like:</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>import re
your_file = "test.txt"
with open(your_file,'r') as file:
    file_contents = file.read()
number_regex = re.compile(r'Number=\d+')
number_matches = re.findall(number_regex, file_contents)

print(number_matches)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ['Number=12']
</code></pre>
<p>This would return a list with all matches to the number regex. You could then do the same thing for the word match. </p>
