<p>I'm beginner in python</p>
<p>I have tried following code. When I run code it doesn't give error, however expected output must be in file, instead it prints output on console.</p>
<p>In actual <code>test.txt</code> file it make entries as <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Why does it print 0 and not the path returned by <code>pwd</code> command?</p>
<pre><code>from subprocess import call

path = call('pwd')

with open('test.txt', "w") as f :
    f.seek(0)
    f.write(str(path))
    f.close()
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you want to get output from an external command, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess.check_output</a> as noted by @Paul Rooney. You may change your program as follows to print the output of pwd to file:</p>
<pre><code>from subprocess import check_output

path_bytes = check_output('pwd', shell=True)
path_str = path_bytes.decode('utf-8')

with open('test.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(path_str)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Where did you read that <code>subprocess.call()</code> captures the command's output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>0</code> you see is the exit code from <code>call</code> meaning it finished its job successfully. As Ignacio says, <code>call</code> does not return its output stream.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Apart from that, the <code>f.seek()</code>, <code>f.close()</code> and the cast of <code>path</code> to <code>str</code> are not necessary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try <code>call('pwd &gt;test.txt')</code> without the <code>with..</code> part.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess.check_output</code></a>. It returns the output of the command, rather than its status code.</span>
