<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to read the contents of a .txt file. Contained within the file is  a URLs list.  I need to open each of the URLs with urllib. I get the error shown below. Can someone explain me how to fix it?</p>
<pre><code>data =(urllib.request.urlopen(r"C:\Users\diese\OneDrive\Documentos\GitHub\MCPP_diego_ramirez\Proyectof\urlsDow.txt") 
for line in data: 
      print (line)

URLError: &lt;urlopen error unknown url type: c&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Extract the urls from the text file first. Then use urllib to access each url.
You can find details of reading and writing files from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Here for simplicity, I assume you want to store the retrieved data in a list</p>
<pre><code>import urllib

with open(path-to-url-files) as fh:
    urls = fh.readlines()

retrieved_pages = []
for url in urls:
    retrieved_pages.append(urllib.request.urlopen(url).read())
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can print the lines of each retrieved url if you want to.</p>
<pre><code>for page in retrieved_pages:
    for line in page:
        print(line)
    print("\n\n")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What does your text file look like? What is inside of it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is a simple text file with 20 lines,and each line is a URL.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you need to open a .txt with urllib? urllib does not handle local files</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@eyllanesc I have to open multiple download links so I create a txt with a list of URLs, I know that I can do it manually, but my teacher said to me that was mandatory use python complements and tools. Maybe  you can give a idea to open the .txt</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As you observe in the answer, it is that they download the file and then open it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When i try the code, I get the next error HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: Not Found Btw: Thanks for the response</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SebastiánRamírez your're welcome. The <code>HTTPError</code> means the resource was not found online. Which might means the particular resource  wasn't found on the server. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404</a>. Good news, your code works, bad news, the page/resource you're looking for is not available.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use a <code>try</code>/<code>e</code>except` block to handle those cases. See <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/HandlingExceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wiki.python.org/moin/HandlingExceptions</a></span>
