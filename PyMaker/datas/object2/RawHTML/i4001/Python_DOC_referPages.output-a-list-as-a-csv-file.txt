<p>You can use csv.writer to write a entire row each time, make a list with your elements in this case. and use on the method writerow from csv.writer. Frist of all you import module csv and then you construct a object writer object, with the dialect that you want in the csv like the quotting char, the separator char, with this object you can pass a list to it and he will automatically write the row on the file to you. Example from documentation is bellow.</p>
<pre><code>    import csv
    with open('eggs.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
        spamwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=' ',
                            quotechar='|', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
        spamwriter.writerow(['Spam'] * 5 + ['Baked Beans'])
        spamwriter.writerow(['Spam', 'Lovely Spam', 'Wonderful Spam'])
