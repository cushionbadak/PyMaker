<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In python is it possible to strip off all special characters and spaces and replace with hyphen but retain dot extensions (i.e. file extension such as .mp4 or .mov or .txt or .jpg or .png or .pdf)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>string = 'Special $#! characters   spaces_ 888323.mp4'
</code></pre>
<p>should result in</p>
<pre><code>Special-characters-spaces_-888323.mp4
</code></pre>
<p>I am using the following method but don't think its a right way</p>
<pre><code>re.sub('(\W+)','-', string).replace('-mp4','.mp4').replace('-mov','.mov')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If it's really file names you're dealing with, consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.splitext" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.path.splitext</code></a> to temporarily detach the extension:</p>
<pre><code>name, ext = os.path.splitext(string)
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can freely operate on <code>name</code>, keeping <code>ext</code> intact:</p>
<pre><code>name = re.sub('(\W+)','-', name)
</code></pre>
<p>And then you just recombine:</p>
<pre><code>string = name + ext
</code></pre>
<p>If it bothers you that this isn't a one-liner, make it into a function. I would also recommend pre-compiling the regex.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Technically, anything that works is the right way. However, there are better ways.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh nice, you added a splitext solution as well ;-) So I'm deleting mine, this is better.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Whoops. I'm on mobile so seeing everything delayed. Didn't see your update until you mentioned it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It did not occur to me that the split + join nonsense I was doing could in fact become a simple sub just by adding a capture group... I am a doob and I need some sleep.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cᴏʟᴅsᴘᴇᴇᴅ. I rather liked your answer. Thanks for the vote of confidence though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks that may work too...</span>
