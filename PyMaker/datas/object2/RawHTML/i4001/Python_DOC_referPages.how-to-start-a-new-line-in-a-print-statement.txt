<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to build an electronic mothers day card for my mom and am trying to make a message that i am going to display on the screen. However when I use a variable to store it as a string, I am not able to get it like this: </p>
<p>Dear mom, (new line)
....</p>
<p>Instead the words in the second line don't seem to be included in the quotations (they are not green in my editor like the rest). Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>card = "Dear mom,
        Happy mothers day!"
</code></pre>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>\r</p>
<p>card = "Dear mom, \r Happy mothers day!"</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>card = 'Dear mom,\nHappy mothers day!'

card
</code></pre>
<p>output will be</p>
<pre><code>'Dear mom,\n Happy mothers day!'

print(card)
</code></pre>
<p>output will be</p>
<pre><code>Dear mom,
Happy mothers day!
</code></pre>
<p>hope that helps</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use triple quotes:</p>
<pre><code>card = """Dear Mom,
Happy Mother's Day!"""
</code></pre>
