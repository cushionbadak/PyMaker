<hr/>
<p>The area I'm getting wrong is the <code>Longest word is: the</code> shown below.</p>
<p>It is printing the most-used word, not the longest word.</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Enter the filename: pride.txt
Longest word is: the
Five most common words are:
the 4322
to 4126
of 3596
and 3531
her 2181
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want the longest word, the key function should make use of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>len()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>max_word = max(word_dict, key=len)
</code></pre>
<p>which would be the same as:</p>
<pre><code>max_word = max(word_dict, key=lambda x: len(x))
</code></pre>
<p>The way you are using <code>max()</code> would give you the last word in lexicographic order.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you have an example <code>word_dict</code>? (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well yeah, it's printing the most used word because the key you use is (presumably) the frequency.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PaulPanzer: because that makes a better example in general</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@papercutbut: On this site, show your appreciation by upvoting all the useful answers. You do that by clicking the up-arrow at the top-left of the answer, if you have enough reputation to do so (but you don't, yet). In addition, accept the best answer (if it actually answers your question) by clicking the checkmark near the top-left of the answer. That is better than saying thanks in a comment. It also helps others to see that your question was answered.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@papercutbut If you accept the answer, that counts, AFAIK.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@fferri It really doesn't. Wrapping a function in <code>lambda</code> for no reason at all is just silly. If you want to demonstrate proper use of anonymous functions make an example where using them makes sense.</span>
