<p>My zip file contains a lot of smaller zip files.</p>
<p>I want to iterate through all those files, 
reading and printing each of their comments.</p>
<p>I've found out that  <code>zipfile file.zip</code> or <code>unzip -z file.zip</code>can do this to a file in separate, but I'm looking for a way to go through all of them.</p>
<p>Couldn't find anything perfect yet, but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38273849/print-comments-of-files-in-a-zip-ordered-in-lines-python">this</a> post. However, the code is too advanced for me, and I need something very basic, to begin with :)</p>
<p>Any ideas or information would be great, thanks!</p>

<p>Not sure exactly what your looking for but here are a few ways I did it on an Ubuntu Linux machine.</p>
<pre><code>for i in `ls *.zip`; do unzip -l $i; done
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>unzip -l myzip.zip
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>unzip -p myzip.zip | python -c 'import zipfile,sys,StringIO;print     "\n".join(zipfile.ZipFile(StringIO.StringIO(sys.stdin.read())).namelist())'
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the zipfile library to iterate through your files and
get their comments using zipinfo.comment</p>
<pre><code>import zipfile

file = zipfile.ZipFile('filepath.zip')

infolist = file.infolist()
    for info in infolist:
        print(info.comment)
</code></pre>
<p>The example above prints the comment of each file in your zip file.</p>
<p>You could loop through your zip files and print their contents comments similiarly.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipInfo" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official zipfile documentation</a>, its super clear.</p>
