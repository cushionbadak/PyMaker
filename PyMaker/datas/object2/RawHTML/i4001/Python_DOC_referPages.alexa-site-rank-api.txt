<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Today I was working on Alexa API to get sites popularity rank using this code:</p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request, sys, re

site = 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/'
xml = urllib.request.urlopen('http://data.alexa.com/data?cli=10&amp;dat=s&amp;url=%s'%site).read()
try: rank = int(re.search(r'&lt;POPULARITY[^&gt;]*TEXT="(\d+)"', xml).groups()[0])
except: rank = -1
print('Your rank for %s is %d!\n' % (site, rank))
</code></pre>
<p>It was working perfectly, but suddenly it stopped!, I checked the API link manually:</p>
<pre><code>http://data.alexa.com/data?cli=10&amp;dat=s&amp;url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/
</code></pre>
<p>and it just returns a word "Okay" rather than a XML string .. What is the problem ?!</p>

<p>That link seems to work fine for me when I tried it in Chrome and in Postman. Are you saying that the regex is returning "Okay"?</p>
<p>Also the response from that link is not in JSON, it is XML. Instead of using a regex to parse XML I would suggest that you use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">XML module</a></p>
<p>Edit: I just tried you code and it worked, although I needed to convert the response to string (it came in as a byte-like object) before passing it into the regex. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That okey means that the IP you are running the script from has been blacklisted by alexa.</p>
<p>If you run it from a different IP it will work. Having said that I have no idea what rate / limit will cause IPs to be blacklisted</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I can confirm that it doesn't work since 10th of May. Haven't found a new working URL for that. Only this html alternative: <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/stackoverflow.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">alexa.com/siteinfo/stackoverflow.com</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Here is a smaller html alternative from alexa toolbar: <a href="https://www.alexa.com/minisiteinfo/stackoverflow.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">alexa.com/minisiteinfo/stackoverflow.com</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">it doesn't return anything for me, just Okay word !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The URL or the regex? Which is returning "Okay"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the URL .. just a blank page with okay word</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I confirm that the problem began on the 10th of May. It just returns "Okay". Perhaps I need to use the official API - even if you make over 1000 requests, it's very cheap anyway.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://data.alexa.com/data?cli=10&amp;dat=snbamz&amp;url=" rel="nofollow noreferrer">data.alexa.com/data?cli=10&amp;dat=snbamz&amp;url=</a> is working in browsers, but returns "Okey" if you requested it from scripts</span>
