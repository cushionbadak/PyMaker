<p>So what i want is for my code to understand if my input has a number in it or not, if it does it is meant to output "Correct" but if it doesn't then it would output "Incorrect" how can i actually make this work. So it knows if there is an integer in the input or not. Any help is appreciated    </p>
<pre><code>import re
yourString=input()
number = re.search(r'\d+', yourString).group()
if number == True:
  print("Correct")
else:
  print("Incorrect")
</code></pre>

<p>According to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects</a> you have a bit of a subtle error.</p>
<p>The statement should not be <code>if number == True:</code> it should be <code>if number:</code>, the reason being the value number is tests as <code>True</code> if anything is matched, and is <code>None</code> if there are no matches.</p>
<p>i.e.</p>
<pre><code>import re
yourString=input()
number = re.search(r'\d+', yourString)
if number:
    print("Correct")
    group = number.group()
else:
    print("Incorrect")
</code></pre>
<p>Note, somewhat bizarrely</p>
<pre><code>import re
yourString=input()
number = re.search(r'\d+', yourString)
if number:
    print(number == True)
    group = number.group()
else:
    print("Incorrect")
</code></pre>
<p>Prints false, so number is not the value true, it overrides <code>__bool__</code>.

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>the regex you're looking for is: <code>\w*[0-9]+\w*</code>. It accepts anything that contains at least one digit.</p>
<p><code>\w*</code> is the same as <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]*</code> meaning it will match any lower/upper -case letter, digit or <code>_</code> literally. It can occur 0 to many times in the string</p>
<p><code>[0-9]+</code> matches one to many digits from 0 to 9.</p>
<p>Actually, if your intention is just to check whether the string has digits you are good to go just with <code>[0-9]+</code> that's the same of what you posted originally.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">do you want to know if there is a digit in your string or if you string is an integer? you have the correct (well, mostly correct) code for contains an integer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">alright i will try this too</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok thank you so much this is what i have been trying to figure out for a few days now and you have solved a giant problem for me thank you soooo much</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oops, if nothing returns, the group method will error. I have modified this again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah i was going to ask a question about that but you just solved it for me thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note, while <code>if number:</code> resolves to true, even in that block if you add <code>print number == True</code> that will print false, but the test function of the number object has been overridden. This is unusually complex functionality btw.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">alright i will try</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok i tried it but i only recognises it if there is only an integer in the input. I want it to recognise it when it is in a sentence like "I am 20 years old"</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>\d+</code> will match one to many occurrences of digits, then it will detect floats</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you can parse floats with the <code>float</code> function above.</span>
