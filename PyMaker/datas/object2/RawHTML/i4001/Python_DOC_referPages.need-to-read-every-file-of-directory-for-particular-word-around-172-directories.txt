<p>Here is the below code we have developed for single directory of files</p>
<pre><code>from os import listdir

with open("/user/results.txt", "w") as f:
    for filename in listdir("/user/stream"):
        with open('/user/stream/' + filename) as currentFile:
            text = currentFile.read()
            if 'checksum' in text:
                f.write('current word in ' + filename[:-4] + '\n')
            else:
                f.write('NOT ' + filename[:-4] + '\n')
</code></pre>
<p>I want loop for all directories
Thanks in advance</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you're using UNIX you can use grep:</p>
<pre><code>grep "checksum" -R /user/stream
</code></pre>
<p>The -R flag allows for a recursive search inside the directory, following the symbolic links if there are any.</p>

<p>My suggestion is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html#glob.glob" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>glob</code></a>.</p>
<p>The <code>glob</code> module allows you to work with files. In the <code>Unix</code> universe, a directory is / should be a file so it should be able to help you with your task.</p>
<p>More over, you don't have to install anything, <code>glob</code> comes with <code>python</code>.</p>
<p>Note: For the following code, you will need <code>python3.5</code> or greater</p>
<hr/>
<p>This should help you out.</p>
<pre><code>import os
import glob

for path in glob.glob('/ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/**', recursive=True):
    # At some point, `path` will be `/ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/inf_&lt;$APP&gt;_pvt/error`
    if not os.path.isdir(path):
        # Check the `id` of the file
        # Do things with the file
        # If there are files inside `/ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/inf_&lt;$APP&gt;_pvt/error` you will be able to access them here
</code></pre>
<p>What <code>glob.glob</code> does is, it <code>Return a possibly-empty list of path names that match pathname</code>. In this case, it will match every file (including directories) in <code>/user/stream/</code>. If these files are not directories, you can do whatever you want with them.</p>
<p>I hope this will help you!</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Clarification</strong></p>
<p>Regarding your 3 point comment attempting to clarify the question, especially this part <code>we need to put appi dynamically in that path then we need to read all files inside that directory</code></p>
<p>No, you do not need to do this. Please read my answer carefully and please read <code>glob</code> documentation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case, it will match every file (including directories) in /user/stream/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you replace <code>/user/stream/</code> with <code>/ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/</code>, you will have access to every file in <code>/ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/</code>. Assuming your <code>app ids</code> are <code>1, 2, 3</code>, this means, you will have access to the following files.</p>
<pre><code>/ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/inf_1_pvt/error
/ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/inf_2_pvt/error
/ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/inf_3_pvt/error
</code></pre>
<p>You do not have to specify the id, because you will be iterating over all files. If you do need the <code>id</code>, you can just extract it from the <code>path</code>.</p>
<p>If everything looks like this, <code>/ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/inf_&lt;$APP&gt;_pvt/error</code>, you can get the <code>id</code> by removing <code>/ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/</code> and taking everything until you encounter <code>_</code>. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks for you response actual my directory like this "/ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/inf_&lt;$APP&gt;_pvt/error" dynamically app_id will come</span>
<span class="comment-copy">we need to use python only</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you please provide the code</span>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks for response my requirement is we have app ID's by using those id's we need to go directory and read files for a word for single directory I have done  I m asking for loop directory structure is "/ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/inf_&lt;$APP&gt;_pvt/error"  please help me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are not expressing yourself clearly. I do not understand what you are trying to do. The code I gave you gives you access to <b>ALL</b> files inside <code>/user/stream/</code>. You can check for the <code>id</code> as you iterate over. Can you try to explain more clearly what you are trying to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">1.we will get appids 2.directory structure is /ai2/data/prod/admin/inf/inf_&lt;$APP&gt;_pvt/error 3.according appid we need to put appi dynamically in that path then we need to read all files inside that directory</span>
