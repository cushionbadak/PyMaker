<p>Are they keywords, constants, or functions? If they are constants, what are their types? It seems python has no type of boolean.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Documentation</a> has it all, one just has to know where to look:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A small number of constants live in the built-in namespace. They are:</p>
<p><strong>False</strong></p>
<p>The false value of the bool type. Assignments to False are illegal and raise a SyntaxError.</p>
<p><strong>True</strong></p>
<p>The true value of the bool type. Assignments to True are illegal and raise a SyntaxError.</p>
<p><strong>None</strong></p>
<p>The sole value of the type NoneType. None is frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not
  passed to a function. Assignments to None are illegal and raise a
  SyntaxError.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>None</strong></p>
<p>This type has a single value. There is a single object with this value. This object is accessed through the built-in name None. It is
  used to signify the absence of a value in many situations, e.g., it is
  returned from functions that don’t explicitly return anything. Its
  truth value is false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Booleans (bool)</p>
<p>These represent the truth values <strong>False</strong> and <strong>True</strong>. The two objects representing the values False and True are the only Boolean objects.
  The Boolean type is a subtype of the integer type, and Boolean values
  behave like the values 0 and 1, respectively, in almost all contexts,
  the exception being that when converted to a string, the strings
  "False" or "True" are returned, respectively.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>None</code> is of type <code>NoneType</code>. <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> are of type <code>bool</code>. You can type <code>type(True)</code> or for any variable on the REPL to figure out its type</span>
<span class="comment-copy">“It seems python has no type of boolean.” Eh? <code>bool</code>? Anyway, they’re keywords that act as constants/literals, because Python doesn’t have that kind of constant. (In Python 2, only <code>None</code> is a keyword, and you can actually assign values to <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>.)</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Not that I downvoted, but it very easily google-able stuff as it's been asked/answered in many different places</span>
