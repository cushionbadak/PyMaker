<span class="comment-copy">Please use a JSON parser to handle JSON content, not a regex.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">above is string, i need to match regex for items. were i can grab items list and then covert to json.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As already mentioned, don't do that! Use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">json parser</a> for that! Afterwards you can do whatever you want with that values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">regex is not capable of flow control, it cannot find matching brackets. Or maybe no one is understanding your question, in that case you should be more clear on what you want</span>
