<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am hoping to edit multiple models at the same time on a singe page. Rather than using formsets, I got this to work with an array of forms that I loop through in the template in the view:</p>
<pre><code>{% extends 'app_base.html' %} {% block content %}
&lt;p&gt;{{message}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;form method="post"&gt;{% csrf_token %} {% for form in forms %}{{ form.as_p }}{% endfor %}
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
{% endblock %}
</code></pre>
<p>However, annoying, I cannot see what I am editing in the output as its just a bunch of text boxes without labels. </p>
<p>As such, is there any way to access the model attributes alongside the form as I loop through like:</p>
<pre><code>{% for form in forms %}{{form.object.name}}: {{ form.as_p }}{% endfor %}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you're using a <code>ModelForm</code> for all your forms, you need to initialise it with the model instance that's being updated (<code>MyForm(data=request.POST, instance=...)</code>).</p>
<p>You can access the <code>instance</code> of the form, it's just an attribute on the form: <code>form.instance</code>. </p>
<p>Note that it's always present on the <code>ModelForm</code>, even if you don't pass an <code>instance</code> when initialising. In that case it's an initialised, not saved, instance of the model of your form. So <code>form.instance.pk = None</code> in that case.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Is your form a <code>ModelForm</code>? If so, <code>form.instance</code> is the <code>instance</code> that's being updated, assuming you initialised each form with an <code>instance</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great @dirkgroten, works like a charm. Can you write an answer so I can accept?</span>
