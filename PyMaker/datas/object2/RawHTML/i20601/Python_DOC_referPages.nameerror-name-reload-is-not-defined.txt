<p>You probably wanted <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload" rel="noreferrer"><code>importlib.reload()</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>from importlib import reload
</code></pre>
<p>In Python 2.x, this was a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#reload" rel="noreferrer">builtin</a>, but in 3.x, it's in the <code>importlib</code> module.</p>
<p>Note that using <code>reload()</code> outside of the interpreter is generally unnecessary, what were you trying to do here?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>An update to @Gareth Latty's answer. <code>imp</code> was depreciated in Python 3.4. Now you want <code>importlib.reload()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>from importlib import reload
</code></pre>

<p>Try <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>importlib.reload</code></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reload a previously imported module. The argument must be a module object, so it must have been successfully imported before. This is useful if you have edited the module source file using an external editor and want to try out the new version without leaving the Python interpreter. </p>

<pre><code>from importlib import reload

reload(module_name)

<span class="comment-copy">A "simple program" probably doesn't need <code>reload</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want to use "reload(recommendations)","recommendations.abc()". But it can't find recommendations</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MindHacks If you haven't imported recommendations, you don't reload it, you import it. <code>import recommendations</code>. Why did you think you needed to use <code>reload()</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@geoffspear Most "simple programs" reading files with non-latin characters do need <code>reload</code>, unfortunately.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GennaroTedesco: if you're thinking of some awful thing you read that involves reload(sys), never do that. Just do <code>with open('file', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f: do_whatever</code>. There is absolutely no need to reload() modules in simple programs, or really in <i>any</i> python program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, it works. But if i wanna use the reload,i must import the file every time?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MindHacks: What "file" are you talking about?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sven Marnach:imp...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MindHacks: <code>imp</code> is a module, not a file.  (It's built into the interpreter core and does not correspond to any file.)  And yes, to use <code>imp.reload</code> you have to import <code>imp</code>, but that isn't a big deal.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, but sigh. Why are they not trying to make the shell more useful?</span>
