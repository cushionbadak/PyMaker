<p>I can import mock with python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4 but when using 3.2 I get the following import error.    </p>
<pre><code>Python 2.7.5 (default, Mar  9 2014, 22:15:05) 
&gt;&gt;&gt; from mock import patch

Python 3.2.5 (default, Aug 25 2015, 09:22:32) 
&gt;&gt;&gt; from mock import patch
...
ImportError: No module named mock

<p>How can I resolve this for Python 3.2?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It looks like the module is not installed for python3.2.
You have to install it. If you have <code>easy_install</code> or <code>pip</code> installed for that interpreter you should be able to simply do:</p>
<pre><code>easy_install3.2 mock
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>pip3.2 install mock
</code></pre>
<p>If you are using a virtual environment you may first need to activate it.
<em>If</em> you activate a virtual environment for the python3.2 interpreter you shouldn't need to specify the version of <code>pip</code>, so <code>pip install mock</code> should work)</p>
<hr/>
<p>Note that this module was integrated in the standard library as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html" rel="nofollow"><code>unittest.mock</code></a> from python3.3+. So in python3.3+ you can <code>from unittest.mock import patch</code> and this wont require any installation.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">In your virtualenv, <code>pip install mock</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>This is because unittest.mock  is new in version 3.3</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The issue is actually with tox and specifically python3.2, but annoyingly i submitted before completing the question.  Given the question this is the right answer though ;)</span>
