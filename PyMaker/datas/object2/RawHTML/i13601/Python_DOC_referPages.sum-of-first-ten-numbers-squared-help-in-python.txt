<p>I am trying to find the sum of the squares of the first 10 numbers.</p>
<p>1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385 </p>
<p>But my program will not allow the line <code>b = sum(a)</code>. Can you help me fix this?</p>

<p>To do this in a for loop, you'd need to add to your b variable each time through that for loop, like so:</p>
<pre><code>b = 0
for code in range(1,11):
    a = code**2
    b = b + a
print(b)
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use python's list comprehensions to do this in one line, and skip the for loop:</p>
<pre><code>b = sum([a**2 for a in range(1, 11)])
print(b)
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow"><code>sum()</code></a> does not work like this. This function accept an iterable and compute the sum of each elements.</p>
<p>This is why you have to set your <code>for</code> loop <strong>inside</strong> the <code>sum()</code>, and this is called a "generator expression".</p>
<pre><code>b = sum(code**2 for code in range(1,11))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The sum function takes a sequence as an argument.  You don't need a loop if you use it.  Also, the exponentiation operator in python is ** not ^, so the you can say</p>
<pre><code>print(sum([code**2 for code in range(1,11)])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Your algorithm is way off, leading to things like trying to add up all of one number (which doesn't make sense to the interpreter, and therefore causes an error). I recommend taking a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official Python tutorial</a>.</span>
