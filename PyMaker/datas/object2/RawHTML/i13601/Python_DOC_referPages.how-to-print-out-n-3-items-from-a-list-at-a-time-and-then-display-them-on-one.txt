<p>As you can see from the code below, I have my program read text from a text file (homework.txt) to a list called heightandweight. I then have it print 3 items in the list at a time. However it doesn't print the 3 pieces of information on one line. How would I do that?</p>
<pre><code>myFile = open("homework.txt","rt")
heightandweight = []

for line in myFile:
    line = line.strip("\n")
    heightandweight.append(line)

print(heightandweight)
myFile.close()

for e in range (0, len(heightandweight),3):
    for i in heightandweight[e:e+3]:
        print (i)
</code></pre>
<p>The above code will output:</p>
<pre><code>['James', '73', '1.82', 'Peter', '78', '1.80', 'Jay', 'Beth', '65', '1.53', 'Mags', '66', '1.50', 'Joy', '62', '1.34']
James
73
1.82
Peter
78
1.80
Jay
Beth
65
1.53
Mags
66
1.50
Joy
62
1.34             
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you don't want to use format strings (i.e. if you just want to print out a set of data without having a newline) then you can prevent a newline by using:</p>
<pre><code>print data,
</code></pre>
<p>or, if you're using Python 3:</p>
<pre><code>print(data, end="")
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming the latter, your code would then look like:</p>
<pre><code>for e in range (0, len(heightandweight),3):
    for i in heightandweight[e:e+3]:
        print(i, end="")
    print("")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You probably need to learn about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/string.html#format-examples" rel="nofollow">formatting strings</a> in python. In your case the relevant code would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>for e in range (0, len(heightandweight),3):
    string="{} {} {}".format(heightandweight[e], heightandweight[e+1], heightandweight[e+2])
    print(string)
</code></pre>
<p>Which could be compressed into just:</p>
<pre><code>for e in range (0, len(heightandweight),3):
    print("{} {} {}".format(heightandweight[e], heightandweight[e+1], heightandweight[e+2]))
</code></pre>
<p>However it would be much neater to have the original text file be organised like this in columns:</p>
<pre><code>James 73 1.82
Peter 78 1.80
Beth 65 1.53
Mags 66 1.50
Joy 62 1.34
</code></pre>
<p>Then your code could be simplified to:</p>
<pre><code>with open("homework.txt","rt") as myFile:
    for line in myFile:
        name, height, weight = line.split(' ')
        print("{} {} {}".format(name, height, weight))
</code></pre>

<p>With python it is very easy. I recommend you strongly to check the function join (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join</a>).</p>
<p>I am not sure if this is why you want but you can test this :</p>
<pre><code>for e in range (0, len(heightandweight),3):
    print(" ".join(heightandweight[e:e+3]))
</code></pre>

lst_copy=lst #if You need to use oryginal lst later use it, otherwise dont
for i in range(len(lst)):
    try:lst[i]=float(lst[i])

for i in range(0,len(lst),3):
    try:

            print(lst_copy[i])
            lst_copy.pop(i)
        else:

<span class="comment-copy">Is Jay supposed to have a height and weight or should your code be able to cope with the case where they are missing?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! How would I work out the average height and average weight of all of the people? The height in this list is the 2 digit whole number?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the last solution is the proper one</span>
