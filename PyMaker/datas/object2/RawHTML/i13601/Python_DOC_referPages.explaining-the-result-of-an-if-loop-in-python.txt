<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a question regarding the following python code. Please note that I'm a beginner in python and trying to learn procedural programming and algorithms on my own.</p>
<pre><code>alpha = 5
if alpha &gt; 2:
    print alpha
    alpha -= 1
    print alpha
</code></pre>
<p>Whilst I was previously expecting the answer to 5, 4, 3, I now understand why its 5, 4. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is probably what you want:</p>
<pre><code>alpha = 5
while alpha &gt; 2:
    print alpha   # &lt;-- these 2 lines of code will be executed repeatedly
    alpha -= 1    # &lt;-- as long as alpha is &gt; to 2
</code></pre>
<p>This will print:</p>
<pre><code>5
4
3
</code></pre>
<p>An if statement will test the conditions of entry once, execute the code inside and exit.</p>
<p>A while loop will check the condition on entry, and execute the code <strong>while</strong> the conditions are true, then exit the moment the condition is false.</p>
<p>The second print alpha became redundant in a while loop.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>if</code> <b>loop</b> ? Sure ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>while</code> or <code>if</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm guessing this is a while loop then? I apologise for my ignorance here. I've removed "if" from the title to avoid the confusion.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As a beginner, you might want to spend some time reading <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the tutorial</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@das-g, thanks. I'm sure this is a very good reference as I learn more python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your comment. My main question is why is the output of the above code 5 and 4 rather than 5, 4 and 3? I'm pretty sure the above code is correct. I'm just not sure why the result is what it is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And also the output for your code (5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2) is different from the one posted (5, 4).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@John Wait what? You just metioned three outputs: <code>(5, 4)</code>, <code>(5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2)</code> and <code>(5, 4, 3)</code>? One code can't produce three outputs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ReblochonMasque: Sure, there's no such thing as an <code>if</code> loop. But you can't edit a mistake like that out of a question because it <i>radically</i> changes the original author's intent.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@John: As Reblochon says in his answer, the code inside an <code>if</code> block is executed once if the condition is true. So if you want to loop while a condition is true you need to use a <code>while</code> block.</span>
