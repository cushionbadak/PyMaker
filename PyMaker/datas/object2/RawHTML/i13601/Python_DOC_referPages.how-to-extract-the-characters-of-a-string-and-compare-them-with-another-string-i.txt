<p>I'm quite new to Python and could use some help:</p>
<p>I have a a string that a user puts in. I want to break down this string into characters so that I can compare each position to see if that position matches another string that is also broken down into characters.</p>
<p>What is the Pythonic way of doing so?</p>
<p>Here's an example so far:</p>
<pre><code>theWord = "Mississippi"

guess = input('Enter your guess: ')

correctGuess = ""

for i in theWord[i]:
    if theWord[i] == guess:
        correctGuess = theWord[i]
    print(correctGuess)
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, a string is a list of characters, accessible using an index inside square brackets. For example, the 2nd character in string1 can be accessed using <code>string1[1]</code>, the 3rd <code>string1[2]</code>.</p>
<p>You can also iterate through the characters directly using <code>in</code>.</p>
<pre><code>for c in word:
     print(c)
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can iterate over the range and access the characters one at a time.</p>
<pre><code>for c in range(len(string1)):
    if string1[c] == string2[c]:
        logic()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Maybe something like this:</p>
<pre><code>str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
[char1==char2 for char1, char2 in zip(str1, str2)]
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [False, False, False, True, False]
</code></pre>
<p>By the way, you can iterate over a Python string like you would over an array since it has an iter method. And if you want to explicitely break down your string into characters, just call <code>list(yourstring)</code>:</p>
<pre><code>list("Hello")
&gt;&gt;&gt; ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
</code></pre>

<p><em>I'm assuming you're using Python 3.x. Since I don't know how Python 2.x works, you might have to double-check to see if the code works in your code as well if you're using Python 2.x.</em></p>
<p><em>Furthermore, the question is a little vague, so I'm answering to the best of my ability.</em></p>
<p>If you want to check to see if <code>'ham'</code> is in <code>'eggshamspam'</code>, then you should use the line:</p>
<pre><code>if 'ham' in 'eggshamspam':
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>To find the position of <code>'ham'</code> in <code>'eggshamspam'</code>, do:</p>
<pre><code>'eggshamspam'.find('ham') #Returns index of 'ham'. If not found, returns -1.
</code></pre>
<p>You don't need to break it down into characters, but if you want to, the most pythonic way I can think of is:</p>
<pre><code>myChars = []
for i in myStr:
    myChars.append(i)
</code></pre>
<p>Take a look at the string docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html" rel="nofollow">online</a>, or type in <code>help(str)</code> in the command prompt (or IDLE) to look at the in-code docs. You can also do <code>dir(str)</code> to fetch a list of methods the <code>str</code> object has.</p>
<p>Good luck, and if I answered your question, a +1 would be great!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should clarify how you intend to compare individual characters in one string to the other string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide an example of two such strings, and your desired output. Also what code have you tried so far, and where specifically you are stuck with your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>zip</code> to iterate over many iterables at once.</span>
