<p>I'm making a script in python that writes code to a .py file in the fourm of variables (e.g x = 6). The problem is when I import it to use the variables and then write some code to it I need to use reload() to refresh the import I quess and allow me to use the variable but it wont reload the .py file it will only reload the .pyc file.</p>
<p>Heres some code to help (not so sure it will :/)</p>
<p>I call a function that writes the data to the .py file and then calls a function to reloading the module but it ends up reload the .pyc</p>
<pre><code>make(2, "name", "'Bob'")

def re(module):
        reload(module)
        print"Reloaded "+ str(module)


def make(0-1-2, var, data):
    if 0-1-2 == 1:
        TempF.write(var+" = "+data)
        TempF.write("\n")
        re(Temp)

    if 0-1-2 == 2:
        PermF.write(var+" = "+data)
        PermF.write("\n")
        re(Perm)

    if 0-1-2 == 0:
        MiscF.write(var+" = "+data)
        MiscF.write("\n")
        re(Misc)


    Reloaded &lt;module 'Perm' from 'C:\Users\Admin\PycharmProjects\DeanRobbieRowe\Perm.pyc'&gt;

<p>Try using the file object's .flush() method after writing.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<pre><code>make(2, "name", "'Bob'")

def re(module):
        reload(module)
        print"Reloaded "+ str(module)


def make(0-1-2, var, data):
    if 0-1-2 == 1:
        TempF.write(var+" = "+data)
        TempF.write("\n")
        TempF.flush()
        re(Temp)

    if 0-1-2 == 2:
        PermF.write(var+" = "+data)
        PermF.write("\n")
        PermF.flush()
        re(Perm)

    if 0-1-2 == 0:
        MiscF.write(var+" = "+data)
        MiscF.write("\n")
        MiscF.flush()
        re(Misc)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why are you editing a module that is presumably loaded at the time of use? That is typically for interpreter usage.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I very strongly recommend rethinking your algorithm instead of pursuing this method of repeatedly modifying and reimporting a source file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And the way you do that is by writing an ordinary text file that is <i>separate</i> from your source code. Take a look at file I/O in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official Python tutorial</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">By reading the file. It's kind of hard to tell what you actually wanted to do in the first place, hidden as it is by this <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem">XY Problem</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As indicated, use the file I/O operations to write and read files.  I would use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json</code></a> as the file format.</span>
