<p>I have the following lines in a Django (v1.8) application.</p>
<pre><code>{% if failed &lt; 5 %}
    &lt;div class="centered row"&gt;
        &lt;div class="ui error message six wide column"&gt;
            &lt;div class="content"&gt;
                The username and password provided do not match. Please try again.
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
{% endif %}
</code></pre>
<p><code>failed</code> is being passed to the template like this:</p>
<pre><code>if 'failed_logins' in request.session:
    request.session['failed_logins'] = request.session.get('failed_logins', 0) + 1
view = render(request, 'main/login.html', {
    'page_title': PAGE_TITLE,
    'failed': request.session['failed_logins']
})
</code></pre>
<p>On both my localhost and my server <code>failed</code> is showing as nothing when rendered in the template by <code>{{ failed }}</code>. This is to be expected, it's not there on the first load.</p>
<p>However on the localhost this causes the <code>{% if failed &lt; 5 %}</code> to apparently evaluate to false, because the message is not shown. This makes sense to me, and since it worked testing on the localhost I assumed it was defined behavior.</p>
<p>On the server (AWS) though <code>{% failed &lt; 5 %}</code> seems to evaluate to true. The message is displayed. This <strong>also</strong> makes sense to me, because maybe <code>None</code> is considered less than anything. It confuses me though, because it behaves one way on local server and another on a remote server.</p>
<p>What could cause this difference?</p>

<p>Are you on Python 2 on local, and Python 3 on the server? The way None is evaluated changed:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I thought of that after posting. The reverse of this is true. I have python 3 locally and python 2 on the machine. I am now looking for how to force <code>uwsgi</code> to use the python 3 I just installed on the server.</span>
