<p>So I have to use the function def sumColumn(matrix, columnIndex) to add the values of the columns created by the rows entered by the user, and I can't quite figure out what to do from this point.</p>
<pre><code>def sumColumn(matrix, columnIndex):
    return

def getMatrix():
    matrix = []
    for row in range(3):
        print("Enter a 3-by-4 matrix row for row:%d" %row)
        row = input().split(' ')
        row = [float(i) for i in row]
        matrix.append(row)
    return matrix

def display(m):
    for row in m:
        print(row)

def main():
    m = getMatrix()
    print("\nThe matrix is")
    display(m)
    print()
    for col in range(len(m[0])):
        print("Sum of elements for column %d is %.2f" % (col, sumColumn(m,col)))

main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you can use <code>numpy</code>, you could use <code>.sum()</code> on the column</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
def sumColumn(matrix, columnIndex):
    matrix = np.array(matrix)
    return matrix[:,columnIndex].sum()
</code></pre>
<p>Which gives the following output:</p>
<pre><code>Enter a 3-by-4 matrix row for row:0
'1 2 3 4'
Enter a 3-by-4 matrix row for row:1
'1 2 3 4'
Enter a 3-by-4 matrix row for row:2
'1 2 3 4'

The matrix is
[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]

Sum of elements for column 0 is 3.00
Sum of elements for column 1 is 6.00
Sum of elements for column 2 is 9.00
Sum of elements for column 3 is 12.00
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow"><code>sum</code></a> function and a generator expression to get the element at that index from each of the rows in the matrix:</p>
<pre><code>def sumColumn(matrix, columnIndex):
    return sum(row[columnIndex] for row in matrix)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You never controlled that every row had same number of columns, and that could lead to later bugs.</p>
<p>Assuming the input was correct, you could just do:</p>
<pre><code>def sumColumn(matrix, columnIndex):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        sum += matrix[i][columnIndex]
    return sum
</code></pre>
<p>But, please always double control input !</p>

    sum = 0                     # running sum

    return sum

<span class="comment-copy">Please consider editing your post to add more explanation about what your code does and why it will solve the problem. An answer that mostly just contains code (even if it's working) usually wont help the OP to understand their problem. It's also recommended that you don't post an answer if it's just a guess. A good answer will have a plausible reason for why it could solve the OP's issue.</span>
