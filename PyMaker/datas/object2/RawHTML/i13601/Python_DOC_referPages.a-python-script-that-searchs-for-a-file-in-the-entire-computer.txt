<p>I am envolved in a project and i want to make a system that the user inputs a string like "summer_photos" and then the python searchs in all the folders and files and subfolders all the way down the C: tree and returns the absolute path of the files containing the name inputed. If i input summer_photos it can return </p>
<p>C:/User/Images/Summer1990/summer_photos.zip</p>
<p>C:/User/Images/Summer1991/summer_photos.zip
and etc.</p>
<p>As i am a petty beginner in Python using Windows i thought asking the masters of programming arts in stock overflow would be helpful.</p>

<p>You can achieve it by using os.walk() function</p>
<pre><code>for path, dirs, files in os.walk("C:/"):
   for name in files:
      if "summer_photos" in name:
         //add path to list
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow"><code>walk</code> function in the <code>os</code> module</a> might be a good place to start. And keep in mind that checking every file name in the entire hard drive will take <em>forever</em>; consider limiting the search to a user-specified directory :-)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What have you already tried? If you have some code you wrote, please update your question with that. It'll help people to suggest you an approach for your problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, this code is very useful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i dont know why did you unaccept this but if you are looking for speed os.scandir is better option it is also in standart modules if you are using python 3.5</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the tip. and about the time, i dont mind if it takes less than two hours.</span>
