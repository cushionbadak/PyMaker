<p>This is my first post here, I only started playing with programming two months ago.</p>
<p>My TI-89, and also Microsoft Mathematics, can divide, multiply, add fractions, etc. all without ever resorting to floating point numbers. I thought that such a module for doing math as exactly as possible must exist in python, but I can't find such a thing anywhere.</p>
<p>So, I've begun writing my own program to do this. So far, all I have is code that can factor the top and bottom halves of a fraction, and then simplify and return the fraction. From there, I will be able to write code that will add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions and leave the numbers intact as exact. After that, I can just write logic gates that will execute the math in accord with orders of operation. I should note that all of this work is done in strings which are converted to numbers when necessary and then back to strings. Eventually, I hope to be able to add in math variables like x and y, and solving for variables</p>
<p>I'm not really sure what my question is beyond if anyone knows of such a module that can already do all of this. Also, does this sound like a useful tool to anyone? Any suggestions?</p>

<p>You should maybe look into the following modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sympy (symbolic mathematics) --&gt; <a href="http://www.sympy.org/zh/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sympy.org/zh/index.html</a></li>
<li>fractions --&gt; <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/fractions.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/fractions.html</a></li>
<li>decimal --&gt; <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/decimal.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested and able, you can volunteer to help the sympy team :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The decimal module provides support for fast correctly-rounded decimal floating point arithmetic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are definitely other symbolic math libraries to do things like solve algebraic equations.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">SO really doesn't do this type of question.  All that aside, using integers, not strings.  And use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/fractions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3.5/library/fractions.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't need to factor the numerator and denominator of a fraction to reduce it to lowest terms. Use Euclid's algorithm to find the greatest common divisor, then divide it into both numerator and denominator.</span>
