<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am writing a script in python which can connect to karaf console like sudo ./client and after logging I want to see what and all bundles are active by using commands like list| grep -i active.I want 1 single script for that.</p>
<p>So these two commands I want to use in my script.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So you need:</p>
<ol>
<li>run a command and get its output</li>
<li>parse the output and look for things</li>
</ol>
<p>Check out the Python docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess-replacements" rel="nofollow">here</a> for how to do this.</p>
<p>It should be something like this (I'm not at all familiar with Karaf...):</p>
<pre><code># output=`list | grep -i active`

p1 = Popen(["list"], stdout=PIPE)
# notice "stdin=p1.stdout"
p2 = Popen(["grep", "-i active"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=PIPE)
# Allow p1 to receive a SIGPIPE if p2 exits.
p1.stdout.close()
output = p2.communicate()[0]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide two things for us: first, show us the exact commands you'd run from a command line that you want to run in Python; second, some example output from those commands.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@erapert the command i want to run is list | grep -i active. but before that i eed to connect to my karaf console</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then the answer I gave should work. If so then please accept it.</span>
