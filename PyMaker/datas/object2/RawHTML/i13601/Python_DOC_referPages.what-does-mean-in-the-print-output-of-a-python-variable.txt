<p>Someone posted <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127908/python-assignment-operator-precedence-a-b-ab-5">this interesting formulation</a>, and I tried it out in a Python 3 console:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (a, b) = a[b] = {}, 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
{5: ({...}, 5)}
</code></pre>
<p>While there is a lot to unpack here, what I don't understand (and the semantics of interesting character formulations seems particularly hard to search for) is what the <code>{...}</code> means in this context? Changing the above a bit:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (a, b) = a[b] = {'x':1}, 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
{5: ({...}, 5), 'x': 1}
</code></pre>
<p>It is this second output that really baffles me: I would have expected the <code>{...}</code> to have been altered, but my nearest <strong>guess</strong> is that the <code>, 5</code> implies a tuple where the first element is somehow undefined? And that is what the <code>{...}</code> means? If so, this is a new category of type for me in Python, and I'd like to have a name for it so I can learn more.</p>

<p>It's an indication that the dict recurses, i.e. contains itself.  A much simpler example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = []
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.append(a)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[[...]]
</code></pre>
<p>This is a list whose only element is itself.  Obviously the repr can't be printed literally, or it would be infinitely long; instead, the builtin types notice when this has happened and use <code>...</code> to indicate self-containment.</p>
<p>So it's not a special type of value, just the normal English use of "..." to mean "something was omitted here", plus braces to indicate the omitted part is a dict.  You may also see it with brackets for a list, as shown above, or occasionally with parentheses for a tuple:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [],
&gt;&gt;&gt; b[0].append(b)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
([(...)],)
</code></pre>
<p>Python 3 provides some tools so you can do this with your own objects, in the form of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/reprlib.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>reprlib</code></a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">this has nothing to do with python's ellipsis object</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fascinating! Thanks for the cogent response!!!</span>
