<p>My goal is to open the file "Panda.txt" file. If there is <em>ADVERB</em>, <em>VERB</em>, or <em>NOON</em>, replace these string by the user input.And re-write the "panda.txt" file.
My error code is:
<code>
pandaRead = pandaFile.read()
io.UnsupportedOperation: not readable
</code>
I am using Sublime text 2 with Python 3.4 on a Windows Vista Home Version. </p>

<p>There was several errors within your code. I will explain them to you, but for further development, please always keep the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/" rel="nofollow">Python reference website</a> to see the usage of the methods you call.</p>
<p>Here are the various errors I had to deal with from your code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open your file, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/io.html?highlight=open#io.open" rel="nofollow">specifying you want to read it</a>
<code>
pandaFile = open("panda.txt", "w")
</code></li>
<li>Do not print your prompt, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html?highlight=input#input" rel="nofollow">but use the input argument to set a prompt</a>
<code>
print("Enter a noon:")
noon = input()
</code></li>
<li>The replace method should be called on a String instance, not the class, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str.replace#str.replace" rel="nofollow">and it returns the new value</a>
<code>
str.replace("NOON",noon)
</code></li>
<li>Actually write your new String <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=file.write#file.write" rel="nofollow">inside the opened file</a>
<code>
newcontent = open("panda.txt","w")
</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Taking these into account, the following code sample is (I assume) what you intend to do:</p>
<pre><code>import os , sys

# With is a special bloc statement,
# closing your variable pandaFile at the end of the bloc.
with open("panda.txt", "r") as pandaFile:
    pandaRead = pandaFile.read()

if "NOON" in pandaRead:
    noon = input("Enter a noon:")
    pandaRead = pandaRead.replace("NOON", noon) 

if "ADJECTIVE" in pandaRead:
    adjective = input("Enter an adjective:")
    pandaRead = pandaRead.replace("ADJECTIVE", adjective)

if "VERB" in pandaRead:
    verb = input("Enter and verb:")
    pandaRead = pandaRead.replace("VERB",verb)

with open("panda.txt", "w") as pandaFile:
    pandaFile.write(pandaRead)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">So what is your actual question ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where in your code do you get errors?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suggest you should do some tutorials on file input output and regular expressions</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't work. I have an error message pandaRead = pandaFile.read() io.UnsupportedOperation: not readable. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Replace your line 2 with: <code>pandaFile = open("panda.txt", "r")</code> to open your file in read mode and not write</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Antoine. Clean code! Now I am getting the error message adjective = input("Enter an adjective:") EOFError: EOF when reading a line . I was thinkng maybe it's because I am using Sublime text. And it doesn't really allow input().But the first input for the noon works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry but I can't reproduce your errors, i am working on linux though. How do you run your script and what do you try to input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's alright. Thanks a lot though. I run the script from the command line.I have more than 1 NOON , maybe that's why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I guess this is the command line from sublime text since your problem is quite similar to this one: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12547683/python-3-eof-when-reading-a-line-sublime-text-2-is-angry" title="python 3 eof when reading a line sublime text 2 is angry">stackoverflow.com/questions/12547683/â€¦</a></span>
