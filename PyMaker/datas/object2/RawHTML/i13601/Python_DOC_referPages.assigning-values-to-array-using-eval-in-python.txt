<p>I have a whole series of arrays with similar names mcmcdata.rho0, mcmcdata.rho1, ... and I want to be able to loop through them while updating their values. I can't figure out how this might be done or even what such a thing might be called.</p>
<p>I read my data in from file like this:</p>
<pre><code>names1='l b rho0 rho1 rho2 rho3 rho4 rho5 rho6 rho7 rho8 rho9 rho10 rho11 rho12 rho13 rho14 rho15 rho16 rho17 rho18 rho19 rho20 rho21 rho22 rho23'.split()
mcmcdata=np.genfromtxt(filename,names=names1,dtype=None).view(np.recarray)
</code></pre>
<p>and I want to update the "rho" arrays later on after I do some calculations.</p>
<pre><code>for jj in range(dbins):

    mcmc_x, mcmc_y, mcmc_z = wf.lbd_to_xyz(mcmcdata.l,mcmcdata.b,d[jj],R_sun)

    rho, thindisk, thickdisk, halo = wf.total_density_fithRthinhRthickhzthinhzthickhrfRiA( mcmc_x, mcmc_y, mcmc_z, R_sun,params)

    eval("mcmcdata."+names1[2+jj]) = copy.deepcopy(rho)
    eval("mcmcthin."+names1[2+jj]) = copy.deepcopy(thindisk)
    eval("mcmcthick."+names1[2+jj]) = copy.deepcopy(thickdisk)
    eval("mcmchalo."+names1[2+jj]) = copy.deepcopy(halo)
</code></pre>
<p>But the eval command is giving an error:</p>
<pre><code>File "&lt;ipython-input-133-30322c5e633d&gt;", line 13
    eval("mcmcdata."+names1[2+jj]) = copy.deepcopy(rho)
SyntaxError: can't assign to function call
</code></pre>
<p>How can I loop through my existing arrays and update their values?
or
How can identify the arrays by name so I can update them?</p>

<p>The <code>eval</code> command doesn't work the way you seem to think it does. You appear to be using it like a text-replacement macro, hoping that Python will read the given string and then pretend you wrote that text in the original source code. Instead, it receives a string, and then it <em>executes</em> that code. You're giving it an expression that refers to an attribute of an object, which is fine, but the result of evaluating that expression does not yield a thing you can assign to. It yields the <em>value</em> of that attribute.</p>
<p>Although Python provides <code>eval</code>, it also provides many other things that often obviate the need for <code>eval</code>. In the case of your code, Python provides <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#setattr" rel="nofollow"><code>setattr</code></a>. You give it an object, the name of an attribute on that object, and a value, and it assigns that object's attribute to refer to the given value.</p>
<pre><code>setattr(mcmcdata, names1[2+jj], copy.deepcopy(rho))
</code></pre>
<p>It <em>might</em> make the code more readable to get rid of the <code>names1</code> portion, too. I might write the code like this:</p>
<pre><code>setattr(mcmcdata, 'rho' + str(jj), copy.deepcopy(rho))
</code></pre>
<p>That way, it's clear that I'm assigning the rho-related attributes of the object without having to go look at what's held in the <code>names1</code> list; the name <em>names1</em> doesn't offer much information about what's in it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">IMHO what you're doing looks weird. You should probably put your arrays to other array (we're talking about lists right?) if you want to iterate over them. This looks like <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem">XY problem</a> to me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't use dynamic variable names, use a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems like you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#setattr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>setattr</code></a>: <code>setattr(mcmcdata, names1[2+jj], copy.deepcopy(rho))</code>. I'm not familiar with Numpy, though, so maybe that doesn't work on Numpy views.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why in the world do you think <code>eval</code> is the right tool for this job?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is definitely some kind of XY problem and you should write your actual problem description. This question reads like you're asking, "How do I hammer nails in with a shoe?"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you think of a better way to word the question that might make it more useful for other people?</span>
