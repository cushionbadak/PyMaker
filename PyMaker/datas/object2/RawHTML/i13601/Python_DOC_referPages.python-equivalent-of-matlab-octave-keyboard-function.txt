<p>there is a function <code>keyboard</code> in Matlab/Octave that stops execution and gives control to the keyboard.</p>
<p>It would be useful thing to have around when I have a long running script and need to test a few things. Since Python is interpreted language I guess it should be possible.</p>
<p>Is there such a thing in Python or I should use something more 'Pythonic'? :) </p>

<p>You can use a debugger, such as pdb or ipdb.  Once you've acquired the module, just add the following line to your code where you want to stop it:</p>
<pre><code>import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()
</code></pre>
<p>You can use <a href="http://georgejhunt.com/olpc/pydebug/pydebug/ipdb.html" rel="nofollow">these commands</a> to move through the code once you have control.</p>

<p>If you're not using an IDE, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow">Python Debugger</a>. If you are using an IDE, use your IDE's debugger.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You may be able to get something close to that with ipython notebook (project Jupyter)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python debugger is not the same. You don't have a python console. Or am I mistaken?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">By IDE I mean an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" rel="nofollow noreferrer">integrated development environment</a>. MATLAB requires you to use one, which it calls the "console". Python doesn't require its use.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can also run MATLAB without an IDE.</span>
