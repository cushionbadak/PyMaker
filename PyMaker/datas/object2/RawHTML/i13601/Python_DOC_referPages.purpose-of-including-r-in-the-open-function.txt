<p>What is the difference between:</p>
<pre><code>with open('PHANTOM_PAIN_SPOILERS.txt') as temp:
    print(temp.read())
</code></pre>
<p>...and:</p>
<pre><code>with open('PHANTOM_PAIN_SPOILERS.txt','r') as temp:
    print(temp.read())
</code></pre>
<p>To my understanding, the second argument <code>'r'</code> for the <code>open()</code> is essentially telling the system to read the file after opening it, which seems to me that it should make <code>.read()</code> redundant but if I attempt to print temp <code>print(temp)</code> in the second example, I end up with something similar to: <code>&lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name='PHANTOM_PAIN_SPOILERS.txt' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'&gt;</code></p>
<p>So what was the point of specifying 'r' in the first place if it doesn't seem to do anything in these instances?</p>

<p>Opening and reading files are different operations. </p>
<p>A file is opened as a first step in reading from it or writing to it. By default, the <code>open()</code> call accesses the file in read mode. Specifying <code>'r'</code> as the second argument is just explicitly doing the same thing. (Specifying <code>'w'</code> opens the file in write mode.)</p>
<p>Once the file is open, it can be read in one big chunk (such as your code does), a line at a time, a byte at a time or more complex schemes using different read operations.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are three different things here:</p>
<ol>
<li>the mode in which you open the file</li>
<li>the operation you perform on the file</li>
<li>implicit arguments sent via default parameters</li>
</ol>
<p>Your statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To my understanding, the second argument 'r' for the open() is essentially telling the system to read the file after opening it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is not quite correct. The <code>'r'</code> indicates that you wish to open the file in read mode; it does not read anything in itself. You can also read a file that is opened in other modes, incidentally.</p>
<p>The <code>open</code> function takes a mode string with a default value of <code>'r'</code>, so omitting this parameter yields the same thing.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There is no difference, the default is <code>r</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are <a href="http://www.endmemo.com/program/python/open.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">different ways</a> to tell python to open a file. Reading, <code>r</code>, is one way, but you can also write to the file with <code>w</code> (etc).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The default is "r" in <code>open</code>. You can skip that. Both of them would return a file object. You will have to use <code>read()</code> for reading the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">refer to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official doc</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So why do people even bother specifying the second argument as solely 'r' if it is what the function already does by default? I assumed it was a necessary step to include it.</span>
