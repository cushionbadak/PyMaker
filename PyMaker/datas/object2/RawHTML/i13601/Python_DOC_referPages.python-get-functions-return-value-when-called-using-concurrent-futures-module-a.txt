<p>I have created a ThreadPool using Concurrent.Futures module.
I have created threads and everything worked fine.</p>
<p>But now i have a function which i want to make it parallel with threads,
the problem is i need the return value of the function each thread should run and not sure how to get it when using the futures threadPool module.
is there a way?</p>

<p>Your understanding of <code>result()</code> is absolutely wrong. From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html?highlight=concurrent.futures#concurrent.futures.Future.result" rel="nofollow">doc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>result(timeout=None)</strong><br/>
<strong>Return the value returned by the call. If the call hasn’t yet completed then this method will wait up to timeout
  seconds.</strong> If the call hasn’t completed in timeout seconds, then a
  TimeoutError will be raised. timeout can be an int or float. If
  timeout is not specified or None, there is no limit to the wait time.</p>
<p>If the future is cancelled before completing then CancelledError will
  be raised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very clear that <code>result()</code> will give you the result of that function you submit.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm using submit to lunch the threads to the pool.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You just call the <code>result()</code> method on the <code>Future</code> instance returned by the <code>submit()</code> method on the executor instance.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">From what i understood the Result method return the state of the thread. what i need is the return value from the function the thread run.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the state?  The <code>result()</code> method returns the <i>result</i> from the function (or raises an exception if the function raised one).</span>
