<p>In Python 3 there are many types of Exception. Some Exception names end with "Error" (for example, <code>StandardError</code>, <code>OverflowError</code>). Other Exceptions do not end in <code>Error</code> (eg. <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code>, <code>SystemExit</code>).</p>
<p>Are all Errors derived from the class Exception? Do all Exceptions interrupt program execution?</p>
<p>Is this inheritance tree accurate?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>Exception</code>: All built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions are derived from this class. All user-defined exceptions should also be derived from this class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, <code>SystemExit</code> and <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> are meant to terminate the program (and you don't expect <code>except Exception</code> to catch them; if you want to catch them, you need to be more specific); <code>GeneratorExit</code> is explained in the docs itself.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "interrupt"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">interrupt is a os concept to take control form running programs, for example assume progA is running and a clock interrupt occur then os pause progA and go to respond to clock interrupt and then comeback to progA again.</span>
