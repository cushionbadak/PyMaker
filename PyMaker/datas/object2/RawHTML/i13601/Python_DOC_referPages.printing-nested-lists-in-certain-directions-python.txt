<p>I am trying a problem to make Graphical designs in Python, more specifically ASCII "banner" words. Each letter is made up of a nested list of lines of the character. </p>
<pre><code> [[' _______ ', '(       )', '| () () |', '| || || |', '| |(_)| |', '| |   | |', '| )   ( |', '|/     \\|'], [' _______ ', '(  ____ \\', '| (    \\/', '| (__    ', '|  __)   ', '| (      ', '| (____/\\', '(_______/']]
</code></pre>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>When printed down for each nested list and across for the whole thing, they make a word.
I am having trouble printing it as I said above, down for each nested list and across for the whole thing.
Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>If you want to print the letters from left to right, you will have to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> the list of lists with itself, effectively <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/4937491/1639625">"transposing"</a> it. This way, the first list will have all the first rows, the second list all the second rows, and so on. Now just <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>join</code></a> those and you are done.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; ascii = [[' _______ ', '(       )', '| () () |', '| || || |', '| |(_)| |', '| |   | |', '| )   ( |', '|/     \\|'], [' _______ ', '(  ____ \\', '| (    \\/', '| (__    ', '|  __)   ', '| (      ', '| (____/\\', '(_______/']]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print '\n'.join((' '.join(line) for line in zip(*ascii))) 
 _______   _______ 
(       ) (  ____ \
| () () | | (    \/
| || || | | (__    
| |(_)| | |  __)   
| |   | | | (      
| )   ( | | (____/\
|/     \| (_______/
</code></pre>
<p>And if you want to print the letters from top to bottom, you can use this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print '\n\n'.join(('\n'.join(line) for line in ascii))
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Although it's not exactly clear what output you want, I believe you could benefit from using the <code>string.join()</code> function.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>Aha, it's now clear what you are trying to do. Using the solution of @tobias_k I would suggest that you make it easy to edit your letters by doing something like this:</p>
<pre><code>m = """
 _______  
(       ) 
| () () | 
| || || | 
| |(_)| | 
| |   | | 
| )   ( | 
|/     \| 
""".split('\n')

e = """
 _______  
(  ____ \ 
| (    \/ 
| (__     
|  __)    
| (       
| (____/\ 
(_______/ 
""".split('\n')

lines = zip(m,e,m,e)   # Spell the word you want here
print '\n'.join(' '.join(line) for line in lines)
</code></pre>
<p>Gives output:</p>
<pre><code> _______    _______    _______    _______  
(       )  (  ____ \  (       )  (  ____ \ 
| () () |  | (    \/  | () () |  | (    \/ 
| || || |  | (__      | || || |  | (__     
| |(_)| |  |  __)     | |(_)| |  |  __)    
| |   | |  | (        | |   | |  | (       
| )   ( |  | (____/\  | )   ( |  | (____/\ 
|/     \|  (_______/  |/     \|  (_______/ 
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show us what you've tried so far?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">do you want to print each element of the lists it is unclear of what you are asking</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is very nice. If <code>''.join(line)</code> is replaced by <code>' '.join(line)</code> there is a nice spacing between the two letters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JohnColeman You are right, I added some spacing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is exactly what I wanted. Thank you very much!</span>
