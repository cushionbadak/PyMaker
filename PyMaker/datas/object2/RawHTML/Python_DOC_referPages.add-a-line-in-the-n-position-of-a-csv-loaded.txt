<p>I have not managed to achieve it. but what confuses me the most is how to add an element in a line "n" of my csv, for example I want to add a line in the line 2 of my csv.</p>
<pre><code>mycsv.csv

name,last name
yeison, smith
lola, boa
elmo, spitia
anderson, exneider
juan, ortega
</code></pre>
<p>this is my code:</p>
<pre><code>with open('mycsv.csv', 'w') as f:
 #I need add "barney, cubides" on position [2] of my csv
 f.write("barney, cubides") #not works properly..
</code></pre>
<p>how can do it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to write to file after you read it. So read the whole csv and save each line as a list, insert your new line where you want to, and then re-write the whole file.</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>index_to_insert = 2
new_csv = []
new_line = "barney, cubides\n"
with open("mycsv.csv", "r") as f:
    new_csv = f.readlines()
new_csv.insert(index_to_insert, new_line)
with open("mycsv.csv", "w") as f:
    for line in new_csv:
        f.write(line)
</code></pre>
<p>ps. You might want to get rid of the whitespaces before and after the commas in your csv file.</p>
