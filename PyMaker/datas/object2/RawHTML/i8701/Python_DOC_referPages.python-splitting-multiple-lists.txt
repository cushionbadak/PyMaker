<p>How can I split a list with multiple lists within in and store them in some sort of variable so they can be tested.</p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>[[2,3], [6,1,7,2], [3,4,1]]
</code></pre>
<p>Upon splitting will be something like this</p>
<pre><code>[2,3]
[6,1,7,2]
[3,5,1,]
</code></pre>
<p>Where I can use each one of them as parameters for my other functions. 
Is this possible, if so how can I produce this? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance, new to python sorry!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for x in [[2,3], [6,1,7,2], [3,4,1]]:
    your_f(*x)
</code></pre>
<p>This will loop through the list of lists, selecting each sublist as x, and then unpacking the contents as parameters in <code>your_f</code> via the <code>*</code> (which has a special name somewhere). </p>
<p>Aka on the first iteration, the code will execute <code>your_f(2, 3)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you just want to extract inner lists to other variables you can use this:</p>
<pre><code>li = [[2,3], [6,1,7,2], [3,4,1]]
a, b, c = li
print(a, b, c)
</code></pre>
<p>output is <code>[2, 3] [6, 1, 7, 2] [3, 4, 1]</code></p>
<p>If you have a function that takes three lists you can use this:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(a, b, c):
    print(a, b, c)

foo(*li)
</code></pre>
<p>output is the same.

<span class="comment-copy">I'll say they are already splitted</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But why do you want to split and then pass to a function? if your <code>lst = [[2,3], [6,1,7,2], [3,4,1]]</code> and your method requires the first and last element, then simply do: <code>call_method(lst[0], lst[2])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have sub-lists with sub-lists? e.g. [[4, [5, 6]], [7, 8]]. Do you have individual items? e.g. [4, [5,6], [7, 8]].</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use list comprehension to test each list separately.  for example <code>[func(x) for x in arr]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">are you looking for a <code>for</code> loop? <code>for x in list: ...</code> stores each element in x, in turn.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! Helps heaps :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When <code>*</code> is used for unpacking it's often called the splat operator.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Anytime Brucey! @Bruce219</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bruce219 If you need the whole sublist as a parameter then just drop the splat</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This was sort of the thing I was looking for, however, the "for statement" was better used instead of initializing a,b,c because my list is not predefined.</span>
