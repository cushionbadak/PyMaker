<p>This might seem like an extremely simple and stupid question yet i can't find a convenient answer.<br/>
I'm trying to use google's reverse geocodding api with django, as the website explains (at <code>https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start?csw=1#ReverseGeocoding</code>) I'm supposed to send a request to the url :<br/>
<code>https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=40.714224,-73.961452&amp;key=&lt;_api_key&gt;</code><br/>
But I can't find an appropriate way to send this request using django to google api.<br/>
To me it seems something so simple will be doable by some method built-in django but all I could find was modules to install.<br/>
If there's no way but installing other python modules which one's the best?</p>

<p>Well, the most straightforward way would be to install <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>requests</code></a> library and simply call:</p>
<pre><code>result = requests.get(your_link)
</code></pre>
<p>You can find additional information (e.g., how to authenticate, use cookies, etc., as well as how to access data in response) in the library's <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>. The <code>requests</code> library is very well written, very intuitive and simple to use. Quite a lot of smart people and companies use it, too, so it's not a half-baked library someone just hacked out over the weekend (as of this moment, it has 5612 commits and 529 contributors on <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GitHub</a>).</p>
<p>If you absolutely must avoid external libraries, why not try <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.request" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>urllib.request</code></a>. It's a bit more complicated, and even the docs themselves recommend using <code>requests</code> if you prefer higher-level interface. But you definitely can get the job done with it. To get started, you can read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/dev/howto/urllib2.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> on how to use it to fetch data. Read this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32795460/loading-json-object-in-python-using-urllib-request-and-json-modules">thread</a> for an example of how to extract json from a response you'd get with <code>urllib</code>.</p>
