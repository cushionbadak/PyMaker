<p>Okay, the tangent I'm talking about isn't tangent inverse, but the tangent that is able to solve missing angle lengths in a right triangle. So far, I've been able to divide the opposite leg by a adjacent length. </p>
<pre><code>#this is for a 6,8, 10 triangle!
#y is 8, x is 6
#if you look on the table, 1.3333 is near 53 degrees

if(a==b):
print("This is a right triagle b/c the legs are equal to the hypotnuse!")

tan = input("Would you like to find the tangent of angle A? : ")
if(tan=="Yes"):
    print("Lets do this!")
    #works with 6,8,10 triangle for now!

    tan = (str(float(y)/float(x)))
    round(float(tan),3)
    print(round(float(tan),3))

<p>For some reason, the program will only use the else statement, and say nope. Please help! THANKS so much in advance. </p>

<p>You're not updating <code>tan</code> after <em>rounding</em>. Note that float objects are <em>immutable</em> and <code>round</code> returns a numeric type; there isn't an in-place update of <code>tan</code> after rounding.</p>
<p>You need an assignment to rebind the returned float object to <code>tan</code>:</p>
<pre><code>tan = round(float(tan), 3)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are multiple problems here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>tan</code> is a string, so it will never equal a floating point number.  Note that you only assign to tan once. The output of your rounding operations is either printed or discarded but not stored in <code>tan</code>.  You probably want something like this:</p>
<pre><code>tan = round(float(y) / float(x), 3)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You compare against a floating point number with <code>==</code>. You should <em>never</em> check equality with floating point numbers! (unless you assign them as literals.) You should instead always check how close two numbers are:</p>
<pre><code>if abs(tan - 1.333) &lt; 1e5:
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Also: Don't convert anything to strings, unless you need to operate on the string (e.g., index it).  Why don't you use Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">math</a> functions?</p></li>
