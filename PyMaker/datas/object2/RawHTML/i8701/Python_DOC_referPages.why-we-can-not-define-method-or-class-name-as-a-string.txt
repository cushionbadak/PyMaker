<p>Why we can not define method or class name as a string ?</p>
<p>I was trying to use &amp; in a method name, in normal name it was throwing error, So i tried to use method name in a string like as:</p>
<pre><code>def 'order_date_&amp;_time'(self, obj):
        return obj.created_at
</code></pre>
<p>But it again showing another error(SyntaxError: invalid syntax).</p>

<p>Function names need to follow the same syntax as identifiers do. Identifiers in Python follow a certain rule which does not allow an identifier to start with a symbol such as <code>'</code>. The accepted form of identifiers is clearly defined in the corresponding <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">section of the reference manual.</a></p>
<p>You can't because the grammar rule defined for identifiers just doesn't allow it, simple as that. </p>
<p>Identifiers are meant to be readable, that's why characters such as <code>&amp;</code> are not allowed. </p>

<p>The python grammar is not defined this way</p>
<p>Take a look at this lecture about grammar (in CS) to get an idea about how a grammar is defined and why it must always be respected although it allows quite a bit of flexibility

<span class="comment-copy">Because compilers expect an <b>identifier</b>, not a <b>string literal</b>.... How would you call that method? like <code>'order'(1)</code>? Then what if a string would be callable itself?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you want to use an ampersand instead of normal English words anyway (for an identifier)? <code>&amp;</code> has special meaning in Python (bitwise AND) and using whole words is considered to be clearer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because language specs says that. And as all languages I know have lexical rules for their identifiers, I just assume there should be a good reason for it - well I know the reason, source code must be parsed and parsers need a lexical definition for identifiers. You can try to build a language that accept any string for its identifier, but good luck with it because parsing will certainly be <i>interesting</i>...</span>
