<p>Well, i want to receive some bytes from a client to a server in python. So I send some strings from client: OLA, 135 and A.</p>
<p>The code lines of server is:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    # Receive the data one byte at a time
    data = connection.recv(1)
    file = open("test.txt", "w")
    file.write(data)
    file.close()
    sys.stdout.write(data)
</code></pre>
<p>I want to write these strings sended by client in a txt file. But after I received all strings in the server I open the txt file created and there are nothing. What is wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In python, open file with <code>"w"</code> removes previous file.</p>
<p><code>'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased), and 'a' opens the file for appending;</code></p>
<p>So using "a" to keep existing data.</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    # Receive the data one byte at a time
    data = connection.recv(1)
    file = open("test.txt", "a") # change 'w' to 'a'
    file.write(data)
    file.close()
    sys.stdout.write(data)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">If file not found open in write mode, else open file in append mode. This looks like an infinite loop to me. When are you breaking out of the loop ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The code continues with:                  if data:                     # Send back in uppercase                     connection.sendall(data.upper())                 else:                     print('no more data, closing connection.')                     break</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you think that code: data = connection.recv(1) don't save the complete string received?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Leonardo it basically rewrites the contents of your file since it is opened in 'w' mode! <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16208206/confused-by-python-file-mode-w">This</a> might help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KeerthanaPrabhakaran It's working. Thank you very much. Can I request the created file from a web page?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Leonardo do you wanna get html from url and save it as local file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ikicha I want to request with a web page the .txt file created by the communication with client and server. My web page was another client.</span>
