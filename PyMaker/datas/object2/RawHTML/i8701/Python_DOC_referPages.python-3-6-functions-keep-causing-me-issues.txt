<p>What I am trying to do is more complicated but I did a simple example to make my problem clear. I am trying to call a function after I have already defined it. </p>
<pre><code>class rojas():
    def get_avg_height(self, height):
        height = {'Julian': 180, 'Aaron': 170, 'Bruno': 170, 'Julio': 175}
        avg = (height['Julian'] + height['Aaron'] + height['Bruno'] + height['Julio']) / len(height)
        return height

    get_avg_height(self,height)
</code></pre>
<p>My traceback is : <code>NameError: name 'self' is not defined</code>
and I am sure that if it got to the height then height would "not be defined" too.</p>
<p>All help is appreciated, thanks.</p>

<p>There are several issues.  First get_avg_height is defined on a class.  That means you must have an instance of a class to invoke it on.  it would look like <code>b.get_avg_height(heights)</code>.  Second when you have a function defined on a class and you call a function self is implicitly set to the instance, not explicit.  So it should only have one parameter when you call it.  In <code>b.get_avg_height(heights)</code> self would equal b in the body of the function.  Third since height is immediately assigned to inside the function anything passed in as the height parameter is discarded before use.  Fourth at the call site there is no variable named height defined, so you aren't actually passing anything in. After you remove self at the call site you will get the same name error about height. Sixth your indentation is messed up the call site should be at the outermost level.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is that exactly how your code is structured? Because your error is expected. Furthermore, that is not how you would call your instance method in Python. Please refer back to your tutorial notes or the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official tutorial</a> on classes to review.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have two problems. Most immediately, you are trying to call the function inside the class definition, rather than with an object <i>after</i> the class is defined. More fundamentally, it's not clear why you have defined a class here. The method does't use <code>self</code> or the argument <code>height</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you're mistakenly returning <code>height</code> when you probably want to <code>return avg</code>, change the <code>return</code> statement. Remove the <code>height</code> parameter from the <code>get_avg_height</code> method. Lastly, un-indent the last line and change it to <code>print rojas().get_avg_height()</code> &lt;-- this is for demonstration purposes, instead you should create a new instance of <code>rojas</code> and then call its method</span>
