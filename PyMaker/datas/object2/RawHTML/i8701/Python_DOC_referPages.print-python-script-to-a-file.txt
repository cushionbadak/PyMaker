<p>Hi Im a newbie about python,</p>
<p>I have 2000 list of company that I want to share in my website.
I was able to import my csv file, using python script.
This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('test.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
   r = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
   for row in r:
       print (row)
</code></pre>
<p>Will you help me on how can I print this to a file?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

with open('test.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
   r = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
   with open(file_path,"w") as text_file:
       for row in r:
           text_file.write(row+"\n")
</code></pre>
<p>Printing each row in separate files generated with an increment number</p>
<pre><code>  with open('test.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
       r = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
       cnt=0
       for row in r:
           cnt+=1
           file_path="text_file %s.txt" % (str(cnt),)
           with open(file_path,"w") as text_file:               
               text_file.write(row+"\n")
</code></pre>

<p>I like repzero's answer, but rows need to be converted to str()  </p>
<pre><code>import csv  ##  import comma separated value module
</code></pre>
<p>open test.csv in readonly mode as a variable csvfile  </p>
<pre><code>with open('test.csv', 'r') as csvfile:  
</code></pre>
<p>set the variable csvdata to all the data read from csvfile,<br/>
splitting everytime it finds a comma  </p>
<pre><code>    csvdata = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')  
</code></pre>
<p>open test.txt in write mode as a variable text_file  </p>
<pre><code>    with open(test.txt, 'w') as text_file:  
</code></pre>
<p>iterate through every row of the csv data  </p>
<pre><code>        for row in csvdata:  
</code></pre>
<p>convert the row of data into a string of text,<br/>
and write it to the file, followed by a newline  </p>
<pre><code>            text_file.write(str(row) + '\n')

<p>Create a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object" rel="nofollow noreferrer">file object</a> using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>open()</code></a>, write to it, then close it.</p>

<p>Differ from the other answers, you can actually "print" directly to a file using the same keyword <code>print</code>. By rerouting the file method:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('test.csv') as csvfile, open("yourfilepath.txt", "w") as txtfile:
   r = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
   for row in r:
       print (row, file = txtfile)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Just use 'open' to open a file and write it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What format do you want it to be written in</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for sharing!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have tips on how to print each row into separate files (txt)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, I am here now....answer edited to show an approach</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. This code works, I will definitely study and learn each line of this.Is it possible if you can help me to understand the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since I was able to print each line to text file. I want to make the first column of my csv file as header of each row. then convert it to html, do you have any tutorial that you recommend?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi I was able to run the script. Can you help to understand the process, each line of the code?</span>
