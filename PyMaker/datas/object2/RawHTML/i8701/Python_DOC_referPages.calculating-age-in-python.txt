<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am attempting to create a code where the user is asked for their date of birth and today's date in order to determine their age. What I have written so far is:</p>
<pre><code>print("Your date of birth (mm dd yyyy)")
Date_of_birth = input("---&gt;")

print("Today's date: (mm dd yyyy)")
Todays_date = input("---&gt;")


from datetime import date
def calculate_age(born):
    today = date.today()
    return today.year - born.year - ((today.month, today.day) &lt; (born.month, born.day))

age = calculate_age(Date_of_birth)
</code></pre>
<p>However it is not running like I would hope. Could someone explain to me what I am doing wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So close!</p>
<p>You need to convert the string into a datetime object before you can do calculations on it - see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime" rel="noreferrer"><code>datetime.datetime.strptime()</code></a>.</p>
<p>For your date input, you need to do:</p>
<pre><code>datetime.strptime(input_text, "%d %m %Y")
</code></pre>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

from datetime import datetime, date

print("Your date of birth (dd mm yyyy)")
date_of_birth = datetime.strptime(input("---&gt;"), "%d %m %Y")

def calculate_age(born):
    today = date.today()
    return today.year - born.year - ((today.month, today.day) &lt; (born.month, born.day))

age = calculate_age(date_of_birth)

print(age)
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>PS: I urge you to use a sensible order of input - <code>dd mm yyyy</code> or the ISO standard <code>yyyy mm dd</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should work :)</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date

def ask_for_date(name):
    data = raw_input('Enter ' + name + ' (yyyy mm dd): ').split(' ')
    try:
        return date(int(data[0]), int(data[1]), int(data[2]))
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        print('Invalid input. Follow the given format')
        ask_for_date(name)


def calculate_age():
    born = ask_for_date('your date of birth')
    today = date.today()
    extra_year = 1 if ((today.month, today.day) &lt; (born.month, born.day)) else 0
    return today.year - born.year - extra_year

print(calculate_age())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also use date time library in this manner. This calculates the age in years and removes the logical error that returns wrong age due to the month and day properties</p>
<p>Like a person born on 31 July 1999 is a 17 year old till 30 July 2017</p>
<p>So here's the code :</p>
<pre><code>import datetime

#asking the user to input their birthdate
birthDate = input("Enter your birth date (dd/mm/yyyy)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; ")
birthDate = datetime.datetime.strptime(birthDate, "%d/%m/%Y").date()
print("Your birthday is on "+ birthDate.strftime("%d") + " of " + birthDate.strftime("%B, %Y"))

currentDate = datetime.datetime.today().date()

#some calculations here 
age = currentDate.year - birthDate.year
monthVeri = currentDate.month - birthDate.month
dateVeri = currentDate.day - birthDate.day

#Type conversion here
age = int(age)
monthVeri = int(monthVeri)
dateVeri = int(dateVeri)

# some decisions
if monthVeri &lt; 0 :
    age = age-1
elif dateVeri &lt; 0 and monthVeri == 0:
    age = age-1


#lets print the age now
print("Your age is {0:d}".format(age))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">offtopic: never start the name of a variable with caps, use <code>date_of_birth</code> and <code>todays_date</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>How</i> is it not running as you would hope? Please explain.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It does not run at all, it blows up and says 'str' has no attribute to year</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you post a question you should give the error message. Something like <code>"3 14 1995"</code> is just a string. Python won't interpret it as a date unless you tell it to.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Input is texte string not a date object. You need co nvert it with with born = datetime.strptime(Date_of_birth, "%m %d %Y") same for Todays_date if it is input value</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>mm dd yyyy</code> is pretty sensible and common in the US</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unfortunately, yes...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much for your help! This cleared it up for me!</span>
