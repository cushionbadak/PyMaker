<p>I tried to make a sound with the winsound libry and my system doesnt recognize it...
Can I write a code in python that makes a sound without installing a new libraries?</p>
<p>I searched some solutions but all I found doesnt work. 
I need a library that included in the python package.</p>
<pre><code>import winsound
winsound.Beep(300,2000)
</code></pre>

<p>You can try cross-platform way to do this is to print <strong>'\a'</strong>. This will send the ASCII Bell character to stdout, and will hopefully generate a beep (a for 'alert').</p>
<p>Even Windows has its own Beep API, which allows you to send beeps of arbitrary length and pitch. Note that this is a Windows-only solution, so you should probably prefer print '\a' unless you really care about Hertz and milliseconds.</p>
<p>The Beep API is accessed through the winsound module:

<p>First: What is your OS? According to the documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/winsound.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">winsound</a> "access to the basic sound-playing machinery provided by Windows platforms". So <strong>winsound</strong> only works
on <strong>Windows</strong>, so if you're a <strong>LINUX</strong> or <strong>UNIX</strong> you have to find another way.</p>
<p>Seconds: What to you mean by "make a sound" if you just want a "beep" you can use <strong>beep</strong> and call it with <strong>os.system</strong> from os module (or subprocess) like this:</p>
<pre><code>import os

os.system('play --no-show-progress --null --channels 1 synth %s sine
%f' %( 0.1, 400))
</code></pre>
<p>You have to install beep (it's an "advanced" pc-speaker beeper), the installation depend on your system Mac/OSX, Linux(Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, Archlinux), BSD?
on Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install beep</p>
<p><strong>Update #2</strong>
@shahar Well according to the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.5/library/winsound.html#winsound.Beep" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doc</a> you did the right thing.</p>
<p>You can catch error that python raise to you to figure it out what's wrong</p>
<pre><code>try:
    import winsound
    winsound.Beep(400, 1000)
except RuntimeError:
    print("The system is not able to beep the speaker")
except ImportError:
    print("Can't import winsound module")
</code></pre>
<p>The code above work on python2.7 and python3 but in case, what's your python version?
I used python3.5.3 on windows and the code work like a charm.</p>

<p>You can play back an mp3...
but this will require a library</p>
<p>a good example is here:-
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20021457/playing-mp3-song-on-python">Playing mp3 song on python</a></p>
<pre><code>from pygame import mixer # Load the required library

mixer.init()
mixer.music.load('e:/LOCAL/Betrayer/Metalik Klinik1-Anak Sekolah.mp3')
mixer.music.play() 
</code></pre>
