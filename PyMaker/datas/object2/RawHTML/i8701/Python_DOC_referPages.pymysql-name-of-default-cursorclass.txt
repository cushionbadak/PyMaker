<p>This is probably a stupid question but I cannot find the information in the documentation for pymysql. What is the pymysql default cursorclass? When I do not specify a cursor class on connection to the database my queries return a list for each row in the response. </p>
<p>When I specify pymysql.cursors.DictCursor I get a dictionary response. I would like to be able to change between them for different connections within a script. </p>
<p>I've written a little function with a context manager to yield the cursor but it requires me to specify the name of the cursorclass each time. I know I can get around this, but knowing the name of the default cursorclass would be nice.  </p>

<p><code>pymysql.cursors.Cursor</code> is the answer. Documentation...</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like it's <code>pymysql.cursors.Cursor</code>, but it's hard to tell. The only documentation I found sucks. You could try introspecting <code>pymysql.connect</code> with something like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.Signature" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>inspect.Signature</code></a> to look at the default argument values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! As soon as I posted this it occurred to me to look in the docstrings. If it is in the docstrings I have no idea why there is not a complete API reference on the RTDs page...</span>
