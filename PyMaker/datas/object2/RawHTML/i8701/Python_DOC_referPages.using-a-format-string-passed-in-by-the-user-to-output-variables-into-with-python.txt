<p>Hopefully the title makes sense as I don't really know how to phrase this well.</p>
<p>I'm using Python and am writing something to parse through iTunes weirdly formatted text files that are made when you export playlist data. I used panda to read a csv, and can loop through each column that iTunes made. For reference here is an example on how this file is laid out:</p>
<pre><code>Name     Artist         Album
Song 1   Hello World    Hey how are [you]
Text     Me Back        Please!
Hey      Python         Is Coo-l
</code></pre>
<p>I read them in with:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
colnames = [ 'Name', 'Artist', 'Album' ]
data = pd.read_csv('myfile.csv', delim_whitespace = False, header = None, names = colnames)

format_string = '[Name] -&gt; [Album] ::: "[Artist]"'
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>format_string</code> is how I want to print them out to a file. I want to be able to scan a string and replace the column name in between <code>[column_name]</code> with the value in the current row while looping through every row. I also want the user to specify this string, so if the <code>column_name</code> matches with a column in <code>colnames</code>, then we proceed with converting it to that format.</p>
<p>For the example above, this code would use the <code>format_string</code> to loop through and come out with this text file:</p>
<pre><code>Song 1 -&gt; Hey how are [you] ::: "Hello World"
Text -&gt; Please! ::: "Me Back"
Hey -&gt; Is Coo-l ::: "Python"
</code></pre>

<p>Like this in Python 3.x. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This</a> or other tutorial about format string will help you.</p>
<pre><code>print('{0} -&gt; {1} ::: "{2}"'.format(name, album, artist))
</code></pre>
<p>Also, as for your case (<code>pandas</code>), print like this.</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(data)):
    print('{0} -&gt; {1} ::: "{2}"'.format(data['Name'][i], data['Album'][i], data['Artist'][i]))
</code></pre>
</div>
