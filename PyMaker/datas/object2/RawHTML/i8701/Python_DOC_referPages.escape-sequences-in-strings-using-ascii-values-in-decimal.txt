<p>Escape sequences in Python support both hex (like <code>'\xab'</code>) and octal (like <code>\12</code>) values. Is there a way to specify the ASCII code as a decimal value (probably like <code>\n99</code>)? I searched a little bit but was surprised to find nothing.</p>

<p>Numeric escape codes are typically in hex (or less frequently, octal), because that's the obvious choice for their intended uses.
From the table in <em>The Python Language Reference</em>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">2.4.1. String and Bytes literals</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notes:

  <br/>
  3. In a bytes literal, hexadecimal and octal escapes denote the <strong>byte</strong> with the given value. In a string literal, these escapes denote a <strong>Unicode character</strong> with the given value.</p>

<p>To represent a <strong>byte</strong>, you must specify exactly 8 bits.
At 4 bits per hex digit, this requires <em>exactly</em> two hex digits.
Converting 8 bits to 2 hex digits and back is much easier than converting those same 8 bits to and from two-point-something decimal digits --- there's no need to multiply (or divide) by 16 in your head.</p>
<p>To represent a <strong>Unicode character</strong>, you must specify a code point in the Unicode <em>code space</em>, which is <a href="http://unicode.org/glossary/#codespace" rel="nofollow noreferrer">defined</a> as "a range of integers from 0 to 10FFFF<sub>16</sub>".
Since these are officially represented in hexadecimal (<code>U+0020</code>, <code>U+FFFE</code>, etc.), hex escape codes are the only reasonable choice --- they require literally no effort at all.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">given the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">section in the official documentation on escape codes</a>, I'd say no.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't use escape code, but <code>chr</code> might be useful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're searching for something that doesn't exist, it's not surprising that you didn't find anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Barmar just wondering whether there are some other shortcuts for this if missing the nature extension to decimal is by design.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Thomson I can't think of any language that provides decimal escape sequences. Many only have octal, some also have hex.</span>
