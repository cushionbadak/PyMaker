<p>I'm curious, for a small custom python package.</p>
<p>If I run the python file that imports and uses function from the package in python2, everything works fine. If I run the file in python3 though it fails importing functions from the package.</p>
<pre><code>    from cust_package import this_function
ImportError: cannon import name 'this_function'
</code></pre>
<p>The functions in the package seem to be python3 compatible, and I used futurize on them just in case. Is the issue to do with some sort of labeling of the package/python version? The package is tiny, 2 .py files of ~8 functions each.</p>
<p>Appreciate the help, thanks!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@LaraChicharo I updated the question to be about the real issue, including error message. The dir() issue was just a symptom of the actual problem. Thank you for pushing me to clarify.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're correct, and I've updated the question to reflect the real issue, as the dir() complication is really just a symptom of the issue. I'm sorry for failing to clarify until now.</span>
