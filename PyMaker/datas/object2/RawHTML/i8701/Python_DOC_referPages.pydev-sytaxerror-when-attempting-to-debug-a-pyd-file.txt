<p>I am trying to debug a python script that depends on a package which has been compiled. It has a __init__.pyd files which when loaded into the debugger I get:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\PyCharm Community Edition 2016.3.2\helpers\pydev\pydevd.py", line 1596, in &lt;module&gt;
globals = debugger.run(setup['file'], None, None, is_module)
    File "C:\Program Files (x86)\JetBrains\PyCharm Community Edition 2016.3.2\helpers\pydev\pydevd.py", line 974, in run
pydev_imports.execfile(file, globals, locals) # execute the script
    File "C:\Program Files\Python27-13\lib\site-packages\package_name\module\__init__.pyd", line 1
SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\x90' in file C:\Program Files\Python27-13\lib\site-packages\package_name\module\__init__.pyd on line 1, but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details
</code></pre>
<p>The file is a binary .pyd file so the error makes sense. How can I tell PyCharm and Pydev to not try and step through the file? I am using python 2.7 with PyCharm 2016.3.2. Any tips?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Your <strong>init</strong> file shouldn't be a .pyd file.<br/>
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448271/what-is-init-py-for">What is __init__.py for?</a></p>
<p>That's used to initialize modules, it's not a windows .dll<br/>

<span class="comment-copy">That part is out of my hands, it is a package internal to my company. The module in question also has a _<i>init_</i>.py</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It might need this line added to the beginning of it   # -<i>- coding: utf-8 -</i>-</span>
