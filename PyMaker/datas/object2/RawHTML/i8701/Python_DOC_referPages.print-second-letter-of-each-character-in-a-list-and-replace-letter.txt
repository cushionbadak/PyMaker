<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I have a list with names:</p>
<pre><code>names = ['pete','carl','michael','steve']
</code></pre>
<p>Now I would like to only print the second letter of each name, so end up with( each letter underneath each other):</p>
<pre><code>e
a
i
t
</code></pre>
<p>Also, I had a second question. I would like to replace a regular 'l' with a capital 'L' and print the names as (also each name underneath each other):</p>
<pre><code>pete
carL
michaeL
steve
</code></pre>
<p>I hope someone knows how to do this :) Thank you in advance!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is a very simple solution to your problem(s):</p>
<pre><code>names = ['pete', 'carl', 'michael', 'steve']

def getSecondLetter(list):
    for string in list:
        if len(string) &gt; 1:
            print(string[1])

def capitalizeLetterL(list):
    for string in list:
        print(string.replace("l", "L"))

capitalizeLetterL(names)
getSecondLetter(names)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you can use it anywhere in the program, taking a list as a parameter.</p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<ul>
<li>I declared two <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">functions</a>, <code>capitalizeLetterL()</code> and <code>getSecondLetter()</code>, which helps us achieve the desired goal</li>
<li>Inside <code>getSecondLetter()</code> I used a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for" rel="nofollow noreferrer">for-in loop</a> to get each string from the list and return the second character, by subscripting it with <code>string[1]</code>, which returns the second character, because the indexes in a string start from <code>0</code></li>
<li>I used the <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_replace.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">replace()</a> function of string, to replace <code>l</code> with <code>L</code></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Edit</h3>
<p>As per the OP's request, I've added a version which only uses while-loops:</p>
<pre><code>names = ['pete', 'carl', 'michael', 'steve']

def getSecondLetter(list):
    i=0
    while i &lt; len(list):
        string=list[i]
        if len(string) &gt; 1:
            print(string[1])
        i+=1

def capitalizeLetterL(list):
    i = 0
    while i &lt; len(list):
        string = list[i]
        print(string.replace("l", "L"))
        i+=1

capitalizeLetterL(names)
getSecondLetter(names)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could also use list comprehensions</p>
<pre><code>names = ['pete','carl','michael','steve']

for n in names:
    if len(n) &gt; 1:
        print n[1]


uppercaseLNames = [''.join([x.upper() if x == 'l' else x for x in n]) for n in names]

for n in uppercaseLNames:
    print n
</code></pre>
<p>Output</p>
<pre><code>e
a
i
t
pete
carL
michaeL
steve
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<p>print (fruits)</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>['mango', 'apple', ' grapes']
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>print (fruits[1][1])</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>p
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>print([name[1] for name in names])</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Shouldn't I refer to each name as 'name' then if I use that? How exactly should I do that? Or does the program understand 'for name in names' ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh Thank you a lot, that might help me! I was just wondering, do you also know if it is possible to answer these questions using a while statement? So a while loop?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, of course, editing the answer right now</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@LB_99 I have edited the answer with the while-loop version! Hope this helps!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this does not answer the question. The correct answer has already been accepted</span>
