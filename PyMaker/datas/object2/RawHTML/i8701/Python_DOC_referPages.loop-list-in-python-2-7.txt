<p>I am a newbie in coding and now I am doing a project in python. 
I would like to make a loop based on this list:</p>
<pre><code>steps = steps = [-72.09677419, -72.09677419,    62.90322581,    39.19354839,    35.80645161,    34.35483871,    32.90322581,    30.96774194,    30, 29.03225806,    28.06451613,    26.12903226,    25.64516129,    24.67741935,    22.74193548,    21.29032258,    19.83870968,    17.90322581,    16.93548387,    15.48387097,    14.03225806,    12.58064516,    11.12903226,    9.193548387,    8.225806452,    7.258064516, 4.838709677,   2.903225806,    0.967741935,    -1.451612903,   -4.35483871,    -7.258064516,   -11.12903226,   -14.03225806,   -17.41935484,   -19.83870968,   -23.22580645,   -26.12903226,   -29.51612903,   -33.38709677,   -37.74193548,   -41.61290323,   -47.41935484,   -53.22580645,   -63.38709677,   -71.12903226,   -72.09677419]
</code></pre>
<p>So I would like to have the starting value repeated again after the final value. I tried using the for loop and range but it does not work.</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: range() integer end argument expected, got list.

<p>Thanks for helping...</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.cycle</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import itertools
for value in itertools.cycle(steps):
    # do something
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Have I understood correctly - you just want the first value to appear on the end as well? You can do so like this, you do not need to loop through it.</p>
<p><code>steps.append(steps[0])</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do search before Question:</p>
<p>In python, you can use like this:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    for i in steps: # List for loop
        print(i) # DO Something you like with.
    if some_condition:
        break # You SHOULD add this for prevent Unlimited loop
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>for step in steps:</code>. For more complex list operations there is the <code>itertools</code> lib.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what do you mean by make a look, it's a list so you could iterate it. do you want to go through this element ? also why you have <code>steps = steps</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes... but OP needs to be generated like in the list?? @KlausD.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Often it is not possible to tell from the error message alone what you did wrong. Please create a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">minimal, complete, and verifyable example</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your question lacks a proper example, the expected output, the full error message and the code you have tried.</span>
