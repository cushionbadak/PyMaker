<p>We know about the <code>min()</code> function in python.<br/>
What I want to do is I want the user to input any number.<br/>
If the input is 2, the output must be the <em>string</em> <code>'min(int, int)'</code>.<br/>
If input is 4, the output must be <code>'min(int, min(int, min(int, int)))'</code>.</p>
<p>Note that I am not trying to compute the <em>value</em> of the <code>min</code> function, but rather to just assemble the strings.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The code can go like this:</p>
<pre><code>def minstring (n):
    if n == 2:
         return 'min (int, int)'
    else:
         return 'min (int, ' + minstring (n - 1) + ')'

print (minstring (4))
</code></pre>
<p>It prints <code>min (int, min (int, min (int, int)))</code> as required.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Note that the actual <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min" rel="nofollow noreferrer">min function</a> in Python, unlike some other languages, can take more than two arguments: <code>min (x, z, y)</code> is a valid call in Python.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Where is your code and your attempts to solve a problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">store user inputs in an array and then apply min()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">'I have another question' - this is your first question. 'we know' - who are 'we'? If there's only one input what do you want to compare it with? You know <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#min" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b><code>min</code></b></a> can take more than 2 values?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think that you figured out OP's intent. For some reason, they never said that they wanted a <i>string</i> output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it is showing a typeerror the error is : cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objects</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@daemon26 Edited so that the code is complete and runnable without modification with Python 2 &amp; 3. If the error persists on your side, ask another question and include the code which reproduces the error.</span>
