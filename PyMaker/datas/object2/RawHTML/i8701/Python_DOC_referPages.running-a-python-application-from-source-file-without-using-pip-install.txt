<p>There is an application where I downloaded the source code and would like to modify it.

Is there a way to run this program by entered a command such as "python3 main.py" rather than installing the program. When the program is installed, I would simply run the command fbcap. </p>

<p>This project has a <code>setup.py</code> file. The "standard" way to run such a thing is to install it (preferably inside a virtualenv) and then run it. Virtualenvs are cheap and lightweight so it's easy to do. </p>
<ol>
<li>First, create a virtualenv. This might be slightly different depending on your platform. I presume you're using Python 3 so <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">these instructions</a> should work for you. Let's assume you created it in <code>/tmp/venv1</code></li>
<li>Activate it using <code>. /tmp/venv1/bin/activate</code> (don't forget the initial .). This also might be different if you're on Windows. </li>
<li>Now install your program using <code>python setup.py install</code>.</li>
<li>Run it using <code>fbcap</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will allow you to run the program in a clean fresh python environment and when you're done experimenting, you can simply delete the virtualenv directory.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">My goal is to run this application through a website. Do you have any suggestions on how I could do that. I want to have a user input something and then have the script output something back to the user. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can run it using the <code>subprocess</code> module. The command would be something like <code>/tmp/venv1/bin/python /tmp/venv1/bin/fbcap &lt;rest of the args&gt;</code>.</span>
