<p>I want to compare two files from two different folders based on when they were created.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

import os, time, datetime 
f1 = "/home/source/file1.py"
f2 = "/home/backup3/file1.py"
os.path.getatime(f1)
print time.ctime(os.path.getatime(f1))
print time.ctime(os.path.getatime(f2))
</code></pre>
<p>The files were created at different times, but I get the same time and date as output; why? I would like to compare the timestamps of these two files so that whenever <code>source/file1.py</code> is changed we make a new copy of it in <code>backup3</code>.</p>

<p>You probably want to use the <code>os.path.getmtime(path)</code> or the <code>os.path.getctime(path)</code> methods for getting the last modification or creation timestamp, respectively.</p>
<p>From the docs, <code>os.path.getatime(path)</code> returns the time of last access of path. Ref: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.getatime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.getatime</a></p>
