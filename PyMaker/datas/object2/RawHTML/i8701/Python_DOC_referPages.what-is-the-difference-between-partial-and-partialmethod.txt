<p>I found out that <code>functools</code> module of Python 3 has two very similar methods: <code>partial</code> and <code>partialmethod</code>.</p>
<p>Can someone provide good examples of using each one?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As @HaiVu said in his comment partial called in a class definition will create a staticmethod, while partialmethod will create a new bound method which when called will be passed self as the first argument.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">partial is for functions and partialmethod is for method (those functions which belong to a class).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you check the documentation for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">partial</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partialmethod" rel="nofollow noreferrer">partialmethod</a>?</span>
