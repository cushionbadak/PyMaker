<p>I've run a simple python command and it derives the following result. Can anyone tell me why?</p>
<pre><code>a=[[0.12,0.35],[0.66,0.79]]
b=[[10*i,10*j] for i,j in a]
</code></pre>
<p>and I got the following result:</p>
<pre><code>b=[[1.2, 3.5], [6.6000000000000005, 7.9]]
</code></pre>

<p>This is simple representation "error".  Binary numbers do not represent decimal values with prefect accuracy, any more than a terminating decimal can accurately represent, say, 1/7.</p>
<p>0.66 is a decimal whose binary representation is just a hair high (actually, they're all going to be a little "off", but this is the only one that shows at a factor of only 10).  You can "fix" this by switching to a <em>decimal</em> data type.</p>
