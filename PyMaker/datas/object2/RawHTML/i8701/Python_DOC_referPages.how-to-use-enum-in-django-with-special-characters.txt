<p>I am using enum34 package like described <a href="http://blog.richard.do/index.php/2014/02/how-to-use-enums-for-django-field-choices/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the example used in article:</p>
<pre><code>from common.utils import ChoiceEnum

class StudentTypes(ChoiceEnum):
    freshman = 0
    sophomore = 1
    junior = 2
    senior = 3

# within your models.Model class...
student_type = models.CharField(max_length=1, choices=StudentTypes.choices())
</code></pre>
<p>However, in my enum field I would like to have use <code>:</code> (such as <code>16:9</code>).</p>
<p>Is there a way to do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Can you be sure that you understand what an enum is? In the example case, freshman is represented by <code>0</code>, sophomore by <code>1</code>, etc. You cannot use a string, such as <code>"16:9"</code> to be the representation in the enum.</p>
<p>The names in an enumeration need to be valid Python identifiers. However, there are other means of mapping strings, such as strings with colons, to integers or vice-versa.</p>

<p>I have figured out that I do not need <code>enum34</code> package and easily do it by hand:</p>
<pre><code>WIDE= 0
BOX = 1
RATIO_CHOICES = (
    (WIDE, '16:9'),
    (BOX, '4:3'),
)
aspect_ratio = models.IntegerField(choices=RATIO_CHOICES, default=WIDE)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm not sure that I have fully understood your question. Would you like to use 16:9 as an attribute in an enum? You can't because : is not a proper character for any attribute. You can't use a variable called 16:9 in your code anywhere.

<span class="comment-copy">Alongside the example from the article, can you also include what you are trying to do? It will probably give you an interpreter error, which will help in cross-referencing with other entries on Stack Overflow.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">16:9 =&gt; 0 4:3 =&gt; 1, etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could <code>16:9</code> and <code>4:3</code> be strings?</span>
