<p>I want the input <code>BANANA FRIES 12</code> to be stored in <em>dish, price</em>.I can't even use <code>dish, price = [i for i in input().split()]</code>.How can i store them if i am using python 3</p>
</div>

<p>You actually could, if the input was limited to one word, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>"HAMBURGER 12"
</code></pre>
<p>Your problem is that it <em>looks</em> like you're only interested in what's after the last split. Luckily if you <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rsplit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read the docs</a> you'll find that there's an <code>rsplit</code> method. And it, too, has a maxsplit argument:</p>
<pre><code>dish, price = input().rsplit(None, 1)
</code></pre>
<p>No need for the list comprehension - split &amp; friends already return one. If you use <code>None</code> as the first argument then it defaults to searching for any amount of whitespace, so </p>
<pre><code>In [1]: "BANANA FRIES \t\t\n 42".rsplit(None, 1)
Out[1]: ['BANANA FRIES', '42']
</code></pre>
