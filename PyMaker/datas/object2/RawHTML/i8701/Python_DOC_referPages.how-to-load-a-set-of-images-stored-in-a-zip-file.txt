<p>I'm a beginner in Machine Learning and want to play around with some image classification code from github with the data I have. I am having problem loading the image data in python. Problem being - I don't know how. How would I load the data and format it? </p>

<p>The word "read" is vague, but here is an example which reads a jpeg file using the Image class, and prints information about it.</p>
<pre><code>import os,sys 
import Image 
jpgfile = Image.open("picture.jpg")

print jpgfile.bits, jpgfile.size, jpgfile.format
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">How does this has anything to do with deep-learning or conda?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html#cap-z" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation index</a> shows it has several of <code>zip</code> related modules. I'm guessing the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#module-zipfile" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zipfile</code></a> module would help.</span>
