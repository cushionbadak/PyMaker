<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I recently started playing with Google app engine (GAE) and I'm failing to do something very simple.</p>
<p>The GAE provides a <code>main.py</code> file which is where I'm trying to import a file I created <code>util.py</code>.</p>
<p>I saw some examples saying that you need to create a module for that in order to be able to include it.</p>
<p>So I did <br/></p>
<pre><code>main.py 
utilities/ 
    __init__.py 
    util.py
</code></pre>
<p>In <code>main.py</code> I imported <code>import utilities.util</code>, I still can't call the functions inside of util.py.</p>
<p>Any ideas where I could learn more about these things?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import utilities.util as myutil
myutil.function_name()  #Using the module name you can access the functions


from utilities.util import function_name()
function_name()  
</code></pre>
