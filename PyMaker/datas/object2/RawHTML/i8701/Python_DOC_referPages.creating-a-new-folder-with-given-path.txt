<p>I'm wondering if any of you have created a function to create a folder within a given path. </p>
<p>For Example: 
NewFolder = ['/projects/Resources/backup_Folder']</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the <code>os</code> library, specifically <code>os.mkdir()</code></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.mkdir" rel="noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.mkdir</a></p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code>path = "/usr/temp/foo"
os.mkdir(path)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">what do you want exacly? and maybe you can have a look into the module os.path.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much Adam! It took me some time to understand what I was doing. I'm new to programming less than a year. landed an internship with a data science team. So this is all a learning experience for me. You were able to solve my issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Happy to help, good luck with your internship</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This won't work if intermediate directories don't exist (e.g. if <code>/usr/temp</code> doesn't exist). You need <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.makedirs" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b><code>os.makedirs</code></b></a></span>
