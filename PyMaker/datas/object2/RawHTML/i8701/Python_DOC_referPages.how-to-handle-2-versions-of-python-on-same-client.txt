<p>I use ArcGIS 10.3 at work and it comes with Python 2.7.8; so when I run any of the .py/.pyc/.pyw files, it defaults to the path leading that versions .exe file.</p>
<p>Because of some non-ArcGIS related work, we are also being provisioned Python 3.4.2, which also installed its own path.</p>
<p>The question begs, how do I tell each .py/.pyc/.pyw file which Python (and associated IDLE [we don't get any IDE at work]) to execute the script with?</p>

<p>Pyenv is an excellent choice. </p>
<p>Particularly, set pyenv local and along with virtualenv, you get whatever you need on a per-project basis.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Use a shebang. What shebang you use depends on your OS, although in theory linux-style shebangs should work on all OS's. On windows, you will need to associate python files with 'py.exe' which will read the shebang and run the appropriate version of python. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">More info here</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use shebang lines (lines starting with <code>#!</code>) on Windows.as well as Unix/Linux. It's included in Python 3.x. See subsection titled <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html?#shebang-lines" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b>Shebang Lines</b></a> of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html?#using-python-on-windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b>Using Python on Windows</b></a> section of the documentation. This is done with something called <code>pylauncher</code> which can also be <a href="https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/pylauncher/overview" rel="nofollow noreferrer">downloaded</a> separately for Python 2.x only installations (where it's not included). You end up with a <code>py.exe</code> to use.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">BTW, I've been using Python for many years without an IDE. I have a fairly decent text editor which allows me to configure it to execute the current file with whatever program I want (and optionally capture the output it produces). The point being, stop feeling sorry for yourself. <code>;-)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Martineau we don't have availability to download <code>pylauncher</code> for 2.x, so when 3.x gets installed, on a Windows OS, in my scripts that need to run in 3.x, I would put <code>#! C:\Path\To\python.exe</code>. Since I wont have a launcher for 2.x, how would you recommend pointing those scripts that require 2.x towards its <code>python.exe</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jonathan Same question to you as I posted to Martineau above</span>
