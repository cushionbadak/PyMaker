<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>what I need right now is to extract a specific file
example:</p>
<pre><code>List = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(List[1:2])
</code></pre>
<p>Output being [2]
what I need is exactly 2, and not [2]
To python in general, anything will help thanks</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>In [1]: List = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

In [2]: print(List[1])
2
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you are slicing an array OR list, it means you giving a range of index like <code>[1:5]</code> so, it must return a list. Better you can use single index of array OR list. Then it will return single instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Well the easiest way to do this is to just print the value of what you want. I.E:</p>
<pre><code>list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(list[1])
</code></pre>
<p>This will print out 2. I am confused on why you are looking in a range of the list which will output another list hence why you are getting [2]. I recommend going back and reading up on lists and what you can do to them in the python tutorials. Youtube might be a great help if your more visual as well. Best of luck</p>
<p>P.S. Remember that lists are 0 based and start at 0. Thus to get 2 in this list, you need to print out the 1 spot which is really the second spot in the list. 0 = 1, 1 = 2, 2 = 3, etc if you look at the list I created.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you can get the single element with List[1]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then just use <code>List[1]</code>.  Also read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Python tutorial</a> which explains basics like this.</span>
