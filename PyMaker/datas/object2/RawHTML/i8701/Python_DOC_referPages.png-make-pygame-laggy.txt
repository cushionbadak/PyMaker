<p>I saw that when you wanna blit a .png image to your pygame display, the FPS drop from 60 to 20, is there a way to get around this, or maybe I did something wrong in my code ?</p>
<p>EDIT : I just tried .convert_alpha(), and it's going around 40 FPS now</p>
<pre><code>menu = pygame.image.load("Ecran titre\\principal\\menu.png")
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

gameExit = False

while not gameExit :

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if (event.type == pygame.QUIT):
            gameExit = True

    #gameDisplay.fill(0)

    gameDisplay.blit(background,(0,0)) # background is a jpeg image with .convert()

    gameDisplay.blit(menu,(0,0))
    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(60)
    pygame.display.set_caption("fps: " + str(clock.get_fps()))
</code></pre>

<p>convert_alpha() is a good first step in managing images within pygame. It is also important to know that blitting an image to the surface is much slower than blitting a surface to a surface. I would pre-draw all images you plan on using onto their own surfaces. Then I would blit those surfaces to the screen. for example, the below code happens <strong>outside</strong> the game loop:</p>
<pre><code>img_rect = get_image("my_image.png").get_rect()
img_surface = pygame.Surface((img_rect.width, img_rect.height), pygame.SRCALPHA)
img_surface.fill((0, 0, 0, 0))
img_surface.blit(get_image("my_image.png"), img_rect)
</code></pre>
<p>Then <strong>in</strong> the game loop:</p>
<pre><code>gameDisplay.blit(img_surface, (x, y))
</code></pre>
<p>In general, you want to take as much as you possibly can out of the game loop. In this case, you are pre-processing the image and doing a faster surface-to-surface blit.</p>
<p>In the future, consider using cProfile for python. It will really help you nail down what exactly is making you code sluggish. Here is some good info on it:</p>

<p>First of all, you should use <code>.convert_alpha()</code>, like "The4thIceman" stated in a previous answer.  That can really speed up your code, and it should be used on all loaded images.</p>
<p>Second of all, you should use multithreading.  Multithreading is the art of making your programs run multiple things at the same time.  Python has a built in "thread" library (though I think it is "_thread" in Python 3) that allows you to do this easily.</p>
