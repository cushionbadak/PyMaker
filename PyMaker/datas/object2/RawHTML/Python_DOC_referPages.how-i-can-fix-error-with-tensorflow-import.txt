<p>I have installed Ancaconda3 and Tensorflow. When I try to import Tensorflow in python shell I receive the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy.core._multiarray_umath'
  ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import</p>
<p>The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:</p>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "", line 980, in _find_and_load SystemError:

  an error set ImportError: numpy.core._multiarray_umath failed to

<p>I am not sure what the problem is as numpy is installed on my system and can be successfully imported in python.
I am using Windows10.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I also had the same issue.
It got resloved once i upgraded the numpy from 1.15.4 to 1.16.1.</p>
<p>If you're using pip:
<code>pip install numpy --upgrade</code></p>
<p>Numpy that came with Anaconda3 is of version 1.15.4. so i upgraded and it worked.</p>
<p>Hope it helps!!</p>

<p>I was also getting the same error on windows 8 when I was trying to import the tensorflow.
I tried upgrading the numpy and then it works fine.</p>
<pre><code>pip install --upgrade numpy
</code></pre>
<p>Numpy 1.15.4 version comes with anaconda. When you upgrade, it will install <strong>Numpy 1.16.1</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>so, you should have to upgrade the numpy using following command
 (pip install --upgrade numpy)</p>

<p>So do I. Under Windows 10, I need to execute:</p>
<pre><code>pip install --upgrade numpy
</code></pre>
