<p>I am attending a coding bootcamp and python is the primary language. For the final project, we were told to study and learn how to create console apps. I have searched online for tutorials and books but none seems to have beginner content. Where can I get the best tutorial on creating Python console apps? I have only done python for a month.</p>

<p>Argparse for parsing command line arguments :</p>

</ul>
<p>Then for input you can use <code>input()</code>, or maybe curses.</p>

<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Curses is a really powerful tool.
As an example here's <code>htop</code> that uses ncurses :</p>

<p>Using <code>sys.stdin.readlines()</code> you can get the data that has been passed to your application, exemple :</p>
<pre><code>cat myfile.txt | myapp.py
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can render your script executable using <code>chmod +x</code>, and adding a header in your script to the python binaries to use :</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
</code></pre>
<p>Then you could create an <code>alias</code>, or add your program to the <code>PATH</code>, so you could use it from anywhere on the system, like <code>ls</code>, <code>cat</code> or whatever you may think of...</p>
