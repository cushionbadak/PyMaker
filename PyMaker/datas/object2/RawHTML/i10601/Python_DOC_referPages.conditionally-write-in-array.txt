<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a piece of code that goes through and open several tab-delimited files. Each time the first tab of the line of this opened file starts with four numbers (ex. 0012) I would like to write this line in an array (cell-by-cell).</p>
<p>A sample line that I would like to transfer to an array is shown below:</p>
<pre><code>0029 Montana 1970 0922 1133 5.4 CR 620 Eagle 31.9 CAA - 1.10
</code></pre>
<p>As can be seen in some cases the tab will have "-". I would like that to be transferred. I know I should start like:</p>
<pre><code>with open(each_file) as f:
   for line in f:
</code></pre>
<p>but I need some help with afterwards</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">the <code>csv</code> module</a>; it <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.excel_tab" rel="nofollow">supports tab separated dialects</a> just fine. For example:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open(each_file, newline='') as f:
   for row in csv.reader(f, dialect='excel-tab'):
       # On each iteration row is a list containing the fields from a single record
       # properly splitting only on tabs, not spaces, and handling the Excel
       # standard quoting rules when a field might contain tabs or newlines
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Point of clarification: Python's standard mutable sequence type is <code>list</code>, not <code>array</code> (there is an <code>array</code> module, but that's a special purpose module for when you need to store lots of numeric data that fits in limited precision C types).</span>
