<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm expecting a JSON msg to be parsed with Python along these lines to come in through MQTT:</p>
<pre><code>{"OPTION1": "0", "OPTION2": "50", "OPTION3": "0", "OPTION4": "0"}
</code></pre>
<p>Depending on the circumstances, these options may or may not be parsed through Python into the JSON msg, and as such, it may end up looking as:</p>
<pre><code>{"OPTION1": "0", "OPTION3": "0", "OPTION4": "0"}
</code></pre>
<p>And thus skipping OPTION2 and it's value entirely. </p>
<p>To avoid my script borking out on my, I was thinking of scanning if the option is there first, before setting it, like so:</p>
<pre><code>        if data['OPTION1']:
                &gt;do something here&lt;
        else:
               continue
</code></pre>
<p>However, this doesn't seem to work, it comes up with:</p>
<pre><code>  File "listen-mqtt.py", line 28
    continue
SyntaxError: 'continue' not properly in loop
</code></pre>
<p>Any help would be really appreciated! Thanks.</p>

<p>If you are working with if else <strong>pass</strong>, <strong>continue</strong> is used with loops:-</p>
<pre><code> if data['OPTION1']:
     &gt;do something here&lt;
 else:
     pass
</code></pre>
<p>Continue is used with loops. Also you can try:-</p>
<pre><code>for dataItem in data:
   if "OPTION2" == dataItem:
      pass
   else:
     &gt;do something&lt; 


for dataItem in data:
   if "OPTION2" == dataItem:
      continue
   &gt;do something&lt; 
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>continue</code> is used with loops, you might need <code>pass</code>ehere. Also, you can use <code>in</code> to check if a key is available in a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>if 'OPTION1' in data:
  # do something
else:
  pass
</code></pre>
<p><strong>But I don't think, that is what you want!</strong> You want to have your default values and fill in the blanks if the key is not available in <code>data</code>:</p>
<pre><code>defaults = {"OPTION1": "0", "OPTION2": "50", "OPTION3": "0", "OPTION4": "0"}
finalData = defaults.update(data)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>pass</code> is what you looking for (not <code>continue</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>else</code> clause is unnecessary. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html?highlight=continue" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html?highlight=continue</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your first option seems to give me a syntax error:     else:        ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes because instead of <code>#</code> you have to have some statements. Replace it for test purposes with <code>pass</code> and the error is gone.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have added my statement in between the if and the else. I did not take your code example literally.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just loaded your example data with <code>json.loads</code> and ran the abovementioned code. No syntax error, whatsoever. Which part isn't working for you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I too have added my example with:         data = json.loads(msg.payload), I have then used your if 'OPTION1' in data: <i>my statement</i> else: pass but it still gives me a syntax error on else: - i have no idea why.</span>
