<p>I have a problem with my code that I can't find the solution as well.  I ask for questions that has to be valid but the loops just continues, and let me input. </p>
<pre><code>print('Do you want to go to the store or woods?')

lists = ('woods', 'store')
while True:
    answers = input()    
    if answers == 'store':
        break
        print('Going to the store...')
    elif answers == 'woods':
        break
        print('Going to the woods...')
    while lists not in answers:
        print('That is not a valid answer')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First of all, your <code>print</code> statements are unreachable. You can find more information <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>#...
if answers == 'store':
        print('Going to the store...')
        break
    elif answers == 'woods':
        print('Going to the woods...')
        break
#...
</code></pre>
<p>Then, your second <code>while</code> statement makes no sense in this way. If you just wanted to print <code>That is not a valid answer</code> in case the input differs from <code>store</code> or <code>woods</code> and give a user another try - then you can just use <code>else</code>, without <code>lists</code> at all:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>print('Do you want to go to the store or woods?')

# no lists
while True:
    answers = input()
    if answers == 'store':
        print('Going to the store...')
        break
    elif answers == 'woods':
        print('Going to the woods...')
        break
    else:
        print('That is not a valid answer')
</code></pre>
<p>If you instead would like to check, whether the user's input is encountered in <code>lists</code>, then you need to do this <code>in</code> trick inside out:
</p>
<pre><code>print('Do you want to go to the store or woods?')

lists = ('woods', 'store')
while True:
    answers = input()
    if answers == 'store':
        print('Going to the store...')
        break
    elif answers == 'woods':
        print('Going to the woods...')
        break
    elif answers not in lists:
        print('That is not a valid answer')
    else:
        # some default case, for example sys.exit() (needs sys to be imported)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You want to check if the user's answer is not in your list of valid answers. What you're doing is the other way around. Try this:</p>
<pre><code>if answers not in lists:
    print('That is not a valid answer')
</code></pre>
<p>You'll also want to either <code>break</code> at that point, or print your prompt message again.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>print('Do you want to go to the store or woods?')
places = ('woods', 'store')
while True:

    if answer in places:
        print ("Going to the {0}...".format(answer))
        break
    else:

<span class="comment-copy">Do you understand that <code>while lists not in answers:...</code> loops forever and that you never modify <code>answer</code> in that subloop? That means you will never get to the top of the <code>while True:...</code> loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi C9 Fox - can you tell us what investigations you have already tried, and what you have found out? For example, have you tried stepping through your code with a debugger? A good Stack Overflow question must demonstrate that you have already done "Search and Research". See the help section's <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask">How To Ask</a> guide for more background.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked flawless for me, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@C9Fox I'm happy this helped you! But next time [before creating a question] please consider investigating into your code a bit - for example, read about <code>break</code> statements and how do they work, as well as <code>while</code> and <code>continue</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I will try but I find it so hard to find information about breaks and loops etc, since they are used in a different way in a different code...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, there are TONS of information about such a common topic. Moreover, all C-like languages implement this. Just find any Python book for beginners and start reading.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am very new to coding, started for 3 months ago. I have read automate the boring stuff with python, and done codecademy's python course + treehouse. I am still feeling very fresh it feels like. But maybe i should read another book.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Quick and simple, working for me...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I get not a valid answer regardless of what  I write.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just tested this on my computer and it works. @C9Fox I don't know what you are referring to when you say that you do not get a valid answer...</span>
