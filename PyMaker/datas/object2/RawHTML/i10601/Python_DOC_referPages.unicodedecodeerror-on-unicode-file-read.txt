<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a problem where, when I execute a script which involved reading in data from a file that contains unicode code points, everything works fine. But when it is executed via another application, it is raising the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc2 in position
  0: ordinal not in range(128)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am executing the exact same code using the exact same data file. A sample datafile that replicates the problem is like this:</p>
<pre><code>¥ Α © §
</code></pre>
<p>I called this <code>sample.txt</code> </p>
<p>A very simple python script to simply read in and print the file contents:</p>
<pre><code>with open("sample.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)

print("Done")
</code></pre>
<p>This executes fine from the command line; executing via Apache/CGI fails with the above error. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A hint to the problem came from the documentation of the <code>open</code> function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is
  platform dependent: locale.getpreferredencoding(False) is called to
  get the current locale encoding.
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow">[Link]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Platform dependent suggested environment variables. So, I inspected what environment variables were set for my shell, and found <code>LANG</code> set to <code>en_US.UTF-8</code>. Dumping the environment variables set by Apache found that <code>LANG</code> was missing. </p>
<p>So, apparently when locale cannot be determined, Python uses ASCII as the default file encoding. As a result, the error was encountered when the ordinal was out of range for ASCII. </p>
<p>To fix this, I set this environment variable in my CGI script. If the environment variable is somehow missing from a user shell, it can be set via normal methods, or just by:</p>
<pre><code>export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
</code></pre>
<p>Or whatever preferred encoding is desired. </p>
<p>Note, the issue is probably far more noticeable if the locale is missing from a user shell, as text editors like vi will not display characters without it. It was significantly more subtle when only an issue when called from Apache (or some other application).</p>
