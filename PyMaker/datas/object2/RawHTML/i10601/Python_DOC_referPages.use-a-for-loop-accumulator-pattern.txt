<span class="comment-copy">You should show us what you tried</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My first time using this and it didn't print correctly, but FOR and PRINT are on different lines.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi Tony; your answer might be correct, but it would be better with some context; for example, you could explain how and why this proposed change would resolve the questioner's problem, and perhaps including links to the relevant documentation. That would make it more useful to them, and also more useful to other site readers who are looking for solutions to similar problems.</span>
