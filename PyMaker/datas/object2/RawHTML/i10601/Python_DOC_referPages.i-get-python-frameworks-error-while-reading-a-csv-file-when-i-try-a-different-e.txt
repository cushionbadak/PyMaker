<p>The file contains unicode characters, which was painful to deal with in old versions of python, since you are using 3.5 try opening the file as utf-8 and see if the issue goes away:</p>
<pre><code>exampleFile = open('example.csv', encoding="utf-8")
</code></pre>
<p><strong>From the docs:</strong></p>
<p>Since open() is used to open a CSV file for reading, the file will by default be decoded into unicode using the system default encoding (see locale.getpreferredencoding()). To decode a file using a different encoding, use the encoding argument of open:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open('some.csv', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
