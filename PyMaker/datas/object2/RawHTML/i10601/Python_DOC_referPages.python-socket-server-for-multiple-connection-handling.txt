<p>Can some one suggest a good example for socket server which can handle multiple connections with threading from python. (Live connection (like server-client ping-pong) that will handle from threads)</p>

<p>Using the <code>SocketServer</code> module you can create a server that handles multiple connections. Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socketserver.html#asynchronous-mixins" rel="nofollow">Asynchronous mixins</a> you can start new threads for each connection. There is a very good example in the Python documentation above.</p>
