<p>So I got this code here:</p>
<pre><code>with open(os.path.join(Path, 'ki/lol/kappa/file.txt'), 'r') as masterfile:
</code></pre>
<p>How can I add a function that tells the user that the file "file.txt" was not found in this directory? I get an error which is called <code>IOError [Errno 2] No such file in this directory</code> after starting my program. How can I show a message like "No file found here" instead of having this error appearing?</p>

<p>You use a <code>try</code> statement. This is called Exception Handling. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow">Python docs</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>You need to catch the exception.</p>
<pre><code>try:
    with open(os.path.join(Path, 'ki/lol/kappa/file.txt'), 'r') as masterfile:
        print "yay"
except IOError:
     print "Oops, couldn't open the file"
</code></pre>
