<p>So I just got a quick question. I need to replace (')    in python but obviously it is not working.</p>
<p>This is the code I use for replaceing things in python:</p>
<pre><code>with open('ID.txt','r') as f:
    newlines = []
    for line in f.readlines():
        newlines.append(line.replace('Machine',))
with open('ID.txt', 'w') as f:
    for line in newlines:
        f.write(line)   
</code></pre>
<p>Replacing Machine works fine but try out  (')  with the code... it just doesn't work. Can you tell me why? And how can I solve this little problem? ^^</p>
<p>NOTE!: The apostrophe I want to replace does not contain the brackets. I just want to replace the apostrophe :)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using <code>replace(''','')</code> will run into errors. Try this instead:</p>
<p><code>line.replace("'","")</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can write string literals in python in several ways like</p>
<p><code>"bla'bla\"bla"</code>, <code>'bla\'bla"bla'</code>, <code>"""bla'bla"bla"""</code>, <code>'''bla'bla"bla'''</code></p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for a in '', "'", '"': print(''' 1'2'3"4"5 '''.replace(a, '*'))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is very straightforward as it can be handled with replace. There is no "obvious" reason this would not work. There is an "obvious" reason you'd have an error and that is trying to call out a single quot with additional single quotes</p>
<pre><code>text = "dog's toy"
text.replace("'","-")
==&gt;"dog-s toy"
</code></pre>
<p>If you try to use single quotes like this:</p>
<pre><code>replace(''')
</code></pre>
<p>You'd fail for any number of reasons, the most "obvious" being that you've commented out all the following code until the next time you use '''</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here's a possible solution:</p>
<pre><code>with open('ID.txt', 'r') as f:
    contents = f.read().replace("'", "")

with open('ID.txt', 'w') as f2:
    f2.write(contents)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm pretty sure the answer is in the question: <code>line.replace("'",)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">please edit your question to include the code that gives you an error, and also include the error you're seeing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Define "obviously", please. I don't see the part of your code that tries to replace that character</span>
<span class="comment-copy">welcome to StackOverflow Link!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Something unrelated: Don't use <code>readlines</code> if you don't have to. <code>for line in f:</code> is better code because you don't create an intermediate list that is thrown away after the loop.</span>
