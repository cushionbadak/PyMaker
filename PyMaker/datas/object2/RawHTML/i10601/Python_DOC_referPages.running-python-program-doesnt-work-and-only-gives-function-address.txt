<p>When I run my python program from terminal with <code>python sumSquares.py</code>, I get the following result: <code>&lt;function diffSum at 0x1006dfe60&gt;</code>
My program looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>def diffSum():
    sumSquares = 0
    for i in range(0, 100):
        sumSquares += i**2

    squareSum = 0
    for i in range(0, 100):
        squareSum += i

    squareSum **= 2
    print (squareSum)
    return sumSquares - squareSum

print(diffSum)
</code></pre>
<p>Even though I have a print statement at the end, it doesn't actually print the result that is returned; it just prints the function address. Any ideas why this is?</p>

<p>You need to call the function by adding parentheses after its name, as in:</p>
<pre><code>print(diffsum())
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">you need to call this function like this <code>print(diffSum())</code>. Currently you are printing <code>function</code> object, while what you want to print is object returned from this particular function.</span>
