<p>I'm using PyCharm community edition 2016.2.1 on OS X El Capitan. I can install the packages <code>flask</code> and <code>werkzeug</code>, but I'm still getting an ImportError. How can I solve this?</p>
<p>This is the code that's producing the error:</p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask, render_template, json, request
from flask.ext.mysql import MySQL
from werkzeug import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In your case it is helpful to create a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">virtual environment</a>, since it's not really recommended to touch the default Python installation that comes with macOS (virtual environments are almost always preferred to installing the package globally). Although it would be possible to install packages using sudo, as the error message suggests.</p>
<p>For users that are coming here because of the error that PyCharm IDE shows when importing the <code>werkzeug</code> hash functions, then try importing from <code>werkzeug.security</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
</code></pre>
<p>This will help your confused IDE make sense of the code.</p>
