<p>According to its [documentation, I am trying to instal Pip running get-pip.py and I get the following error. My version of Python is 3.2.3. Any ideas of what I should do?  </p>

<p>Python 3.2 is an old version and I <em>believe</em> past its end of life. You should be using at <em>least</em> Python 3.4, but 3.5 would be preferable.</p>
<p>The <code>u</code> prefix for strings didn't appear until Python 3.3 I believe though it may have been 3.4.</p>

<p>You are trying to install a version of pip that no longer supports Python 3.2. Support for 3.2 was <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/" rel="nofollow">dropped in version 8.0.0</a>. Python 3.2 doesn't support the required <code>u'...'</code> compatibility syntax for string literals.</p>
<p>You could try to download <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/7.1.2" rel="nofollow">version 7.1.2</a> (download the source distribution, the <code>.tar.gz</code> link), unpack that tarball and install the package with <code>python setup.py install</code>.</p>
<p>I would, however, strongly suggest you upgrade your Python installation instead. Python 3.2 stopped receiving support in February 2016, and 3.3 (first released September 2012), 3.4 (March 2014) and 3.5 (September 2015)– have all been released before that point.</p>

<p>Try to use newest version of Python, especially when use Python 3.x.</p>
<p>In this case you use latest command and pip but use old Python. I you have to use old version, read old documentation.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Pip lists Python 3.3 - 3.5 as supported; 3.2 is too old and missing too many features.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Related: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38957543">Hi, I just installed requests with pip but I can't import it</a>, same syntax error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">3.3</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">3.3 added the <code>u'..'</code> prefix. As a result, the minimum version of Python 3.x is 3.3, see <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pypi.python.org/pypi/pip</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I can't install the newest version of Python right now (I don't have administrator permissions), can I get an older version of pip?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I could install Python version 3.3 and it worked, thanks.</span>
