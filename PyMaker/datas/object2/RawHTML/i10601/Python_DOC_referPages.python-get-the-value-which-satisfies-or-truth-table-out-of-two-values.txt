<p>I have two objects which returns two values, lets say x1, x2. I just have to check whether the values exist or not and if exists it should return those, which is not None,False, 0. </p>
<p>This is just simple try, which is OK:</p>
<pre><code>def get_valid_keys(x1, x2):
    """ """
    a = []
    if x1: a.append(x1)
    if x2: a.append(x2)
    return a        
</code></pre>
<p>But I feel,there should be something in python which would return above variables instead of values with an efficient way:
like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x1, x2 = 0, 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; x1 or x2
1     # It should return x2    
&gt;&gt;&gt; x1, x2 = 1, 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; x1 or x2
1    # It should return x1    
&gt;&gt;&gt; x1, x2 = 0, 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; x1 or x2
0    # It should return None     
&gt;&gt;&gt; x1, x2 = 1, 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; x1 or x2
1     # It should return x1, x2    
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Weed out any zeroes:</p>
<pre><code>filter(lambda x: x, [x1, x2])
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you seen <code>filter()</code>?  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter</a>.  You can also do it using a list comprehension.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python doesn't "know" the names of the references ("variables"). You can't simply return <code>'x1'</code> instead of <code>0</code>. You can't go back from <code>0</code> to the name or names that reference it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cdarke I believe OP wants to get the name of the reference, not its value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace:  OK,  I misunderstood then.  He/she should be using a dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code> are not values, they are references to their values.  A value can have many references to it - it can be known by many names.  The names "x1" and "x2" are not even in scope outside the function.  If you want a text name to be tied to a value then you should consider using a dictionary.</span>
