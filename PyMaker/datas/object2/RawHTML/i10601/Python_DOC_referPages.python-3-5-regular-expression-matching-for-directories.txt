<p>I am using the Python 3.5 <code>re</code> module with this code:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; test
'\\\\192.168.1.2\\shared\\Department\\Travel\\FY 2015\\Travel Expense Statement Jul 25 2019.pdf'
</code></pre>
<p>I want to return <code>Department\Travel\FY 2015\Travel Expense Statement Jul 25 2019.pdf</code>. I have tried the following regex, but keep getting errors such as <code>sre_constants.error: nothing to repeat at position 12</code></p>
<pre><code>x=re.compile( "shared\\[^\\](*?)" )
print( x.findall(test) )
</code></pre>
<p>or the empty result <code>['']</code> for:</p>
<pre><code>x=re.compile( "shared\\\(.*?)" )
</code></pre>
<p>How can I accomplish this operation?</p>

<p>The problem with your <em>regular expression</em> is very simple, remove the <code>?</code> character in your second regular expression. You just need <code>.*</code> that matches zero or more characters. </p>
<p><code>*?</code> together means a lazy quantifier that matches as little as possible, so if you use <code>.*?</code>, it means "zero or more any characters, but as few as possible". As for the first regular expression, the <code>*</code> does not have a preceding atom to which it could apply to, hence the error.</p>

<p>In general case, you should rather use the <code>ntpath</code> module as in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39088502/918959">kennytm's answer there</a>.</p>

<p>You shouldn't use regex for this. Instead, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.splitdrive" rel="nofollow"><code>ntpath</code> module</a> (or <code>os.path</code> if you are sure the script will only run on Windows):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = '\\\\192.168.1.2\\shared\\Department\\Travel\\FY 2015\\Travel Expense Statement Jul 25 2019.pdf'
&gt;&gt;&gt; import ntpath
&gt;&gt;&gt; ntpath.splitdrive(s)
('\\\\192.168.1.2\\shared', '\\Department\\Travel\\FY 2015\\Travel Expense Statement Jul 25 2019.pdf')
&gt;&gt;&gt; ntpath.splitdrive(s)[1][1:]
'Department\\Travel\\FY 2015\\Travel Expense Statement Jul 25 2019.pdf'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Upvote for answering literal question and teaching about regex syntax, but I don't think this is the best answer because the one by @kennytm one cuts to the root of the XY problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Antti: Thanks. I have been fiddling around with this and thought I had tried that variation, but I guess not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great job cutting to the root of the XY problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kennytm: Thanks. I narrowed down the question as small as possible.  The REs are stored in a .ini file and are therefore not strictly nt paths.  However, I did not know about the ntpath module and will definitely be using it in the future!</span>
