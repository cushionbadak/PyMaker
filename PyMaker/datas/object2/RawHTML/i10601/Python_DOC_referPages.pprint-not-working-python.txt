<p>I'm trying to use Python's <code>pprint</code> on a dictionary but for some reason it isn't working. Here's my code (I'm using PyCharm Pro as my IDE):`</p>
<pre><code>from pprint import pprint
message = "Come on Eileen!"
count = {}

for character in message:
    count.setdefault(character, 0)
    count[character] += 1

pprint(count)
</code></pre>
<p>And here's my output:</p>
<pre><code>{' ': 2, '!': 1, 'C': 1, 'E': 1, 'e': 3, 'i': 1, 'l': 1, 'm': 1, 'n': 2, 'o': 2}
</code></pre>
<p>Any help with this would be appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The output is entirely correct and expected. From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>pprint</code> module documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The formatted representation <strong>keeps objects on a single line if it can</strong>, and breaks them onto multiple lines if they donâ€™t fit within the allowed width. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bold emphasis mine.</p>
<p>You could set the <code>width</code> keyword argument to <code>1</code> to force every key-value pair being printed on a separate line:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint(count, width=1)
{' ': 2,
 '!': 1,
 'C': 1,
 'E': 1,
 'e': 3,
 'i': 1,
 'l': 1,
 'm': 1,
 'n': 2,
 'o': 2}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What makes you think it is not working? What did you expect instead? That's the correct output for <code>pprint()</code>; the output fits on one line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm reading through Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, in chapter 5 it talks about pprint, gives an example of code (almost identical to mine) but shows to output to be key-pair values being printed on separate lines. *(I just realised the reason it wasn't doing that was because my string wasn't long enough)</span>
