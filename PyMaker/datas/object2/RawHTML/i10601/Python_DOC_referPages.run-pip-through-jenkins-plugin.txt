<p>If pip is not installed on the jenkins linux-box,
is there any jenkins-plugin that lets me run pip, without installing it at the os-level?</p>

<p>Create a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow">virtual environment</a>. It should come with pip, but otherwise install it in the virtualenv.</p>

<p>Not a specific plug-in like you might want, but as was said, you can create a virtual environment in one of a few ways to get the functionality you're after.</p>
<p>Docker can handle this, you can create a small script to build a docker image that will have access to pip and there are Jenkins plug-ins for docker.</p>
