<p>I am trying to make a 3 part name generator in python for an RPG game. I have a 2 dimensional array in order to combine 3 parts of a name:</p>
<pre><code>name = [["Raan","Feim","Od","Yol","Dur"]["Mir","Zii","Ah","Toor","Neh"][   "Tah","Gron","Viing","Shul","Viir"]]
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I run it, I get the error:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not tuple
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way around this/can it be done in a 2d array</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>wrong list syntax. This works:</p>
<pre><code>import random

name = [["Raan","Feim","Od","Yol","Dur"],["Mir","Zii","Ah","Toor","Neh"],["Tah","Gron","Viing","Shul","Viir"]]

print (" ".join([random.choice(nl) for nl in name]))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need commas inbetween each list.</p>
<pre><code>name = [["Raan","Feim","Od","Yol","Dur"],["Mir","Zii","Ah","Toor","Neh"],[ "Tah","Gron","Viing","Shul","Viir"]]
</code></pre>
<p>then to get a random name use:</p>
<pre><code>from random import randint
print (name[randint(0,2)][randint(0,4)])
</code></pre>
<p>and you could do this 3 times or however you want the name to come out</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>Something like this is what I'm guessing you want:</p>
<pre><code>from random import randint

name = [["Raan","Feim","Od","Yol","Dur"],["Mir","Zii","Ah","Toor","Neh"],[ "Tah","Gron","Viing","Shul","Viir"]]

print(name[randint(0,2)][randint(0,4)] + name[randint(0,2)][randint(0,4)] + name[randint(0,2)][randint(0,4)])
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You need commas between your lists:</p>

</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you show the code you're running that generates that error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, sorry I see the issue now. I've provided an answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree, but the OP's posted error was due to the lack of commas so that's all there was to really go on for an answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.choice</code></a> looks like a cleaner and more flexible way to get a random name from the list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matthias ah yeah, I agree. Been a while since I used Python haha</span>
