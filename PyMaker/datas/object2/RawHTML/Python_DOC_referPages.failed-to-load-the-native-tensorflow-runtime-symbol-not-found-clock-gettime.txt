<p>Been having a ton of issues loading Tensorflow. I've uninstalled and reinstalled numpy (now it's up to date, that was another initial error), uninstalled and reinstalled Tensorflow, and uninstalled and reinstalled Nextgenrnn (the package I plan to use it in combination with).</p>
<p>Launching python and calling "import tensorflow", I receive this really long error message.</p>
<p>Here is a full stack trace:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure how to proceed.</p>
<p>I have Python 3.5.6 installed from Anaconda, running on OS X El Capitan.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In the macOS SDK <code>clock_gettime</code> is declared like this: <code>__CLOCK_AVAILABILITY
int clock_gettime(clockid_t __clock_id, struct timespec *__tp);</code></p>
<p>and if we look at the definition of the <code>__CLOCK_AVAILABILITY</code> macro: <code>#define __CLOCK_AVAILABILITY __OSX_AVAILABLE(10.12) __IOS_AVAILABLE(10.0) __TVOS_AVAILABLE(10.0) __WATCHOS_AVAILABLE(3.0)</code></p>
<p>We can see that <code>clock_gettime</code> was not added to the API until macOS 10.12. You are on El Capitan which is macOS 10.11. You need to update your OS, or downgrade your packages.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">This is an issue with the version of a TensorFlow binary. The error <code>Symbol not found: _clock_gettime</code> says that the import was expecting to find that function in the .so and could not find it. That is what happens when a new function is added to the .so, that the import expects to find, but the .so is an earlier version that doesn't contain it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BoarGules thank you â€“ so I need to update my other packages? or just use an older tensorflow?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The original error seems to be complaining about /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib but I have no idea what that does.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BoarGules <code>libSystem</code> is a huge wrapper library on macOS that wraps nearly every library that macOS ships with including libc which is is where <code>clock_gettime</code> is located. see my answer below.</span>
