<p>I have a list with movie names:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DGsKK.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Movie List</a></p>
<p>And another list of questions about movies:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/buFOD.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">List of questions</a></p>
<p>My objective is to loop through the list of questions and each time the function finds a name in the question that is in the list of movies, changes the name to "MOVIE".
At the moment i can do it for each question:
def remove_movie_name_1(text):</p>
<pre><code>    for i in tqdm(range(len(movies))):
       return re.sub(movies[42], 'MOVIE', text)
remove_movie_name_1(tq[21])
</code></pre>
<p>This way i can change it for example from "What was the role played by Tim Allen in Toy Story 3?" to "What was the role played by Tim Allen in MOVIE?"</p>
<p>When i tried to apply it to the whole list I used this code:</p>
<pre><code>def remove_movie_name(text):
for i in tqdm(range(len(movies))):
    return re.sub(movies[i], 'MOVIE', text)

for i in tqdm(range(len(tq))):
tq[i] = remove_movie_name(tq[i])  
</code></pre>
<p>But this code doesn't change anything and I can't see what's the problem.
Thank you.</p>

<p><code>return</code> exits the function immediately.  Your loop only runs one time.</p>
