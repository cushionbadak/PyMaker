<p>This is pretty trivial. If you want to delete an issue, you need the issue object. One way to obtain the object is via <code>jira.create_issue()</code> function that you mentioned in which case you can delete it as follows:</p>
<pre><code>issue = jira.create_issue(...)
...
issue.delete()
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively if you happen to know the ID of the issue you want to delete you could delete it like so:</p>
<pre><code>issue = jira.issue("EXAMPLE-244")
issue.delete()
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't know the IDs of the issues you want to delete, you might first have to find the issues via the <code>jira.search_issues()</code> function. This would look like:</p>
<pre><code>issues = jira.search_issues('project="%s" AND summary~"%s"' % ("project_key", "issue title"), maxResults=100)

for issue in issues:
    issue.delete()
</code></pre>
