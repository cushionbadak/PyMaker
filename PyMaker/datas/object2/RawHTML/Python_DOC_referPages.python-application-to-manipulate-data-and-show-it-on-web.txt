<p>I want to create a python application that accepts an input from a web page and searching it in database and again return result to that web page. but I don't know where can I start?
Is Django useful in my case?
or maybe requests library? 
What are they for?</p>

<p>Of course you can do it in Django.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/forms/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">What you need is a form to take the data input from a user</a></p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/views/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">and then with a view you can turn the proper response you want.</a></p>

<p>I agree that the question is to broad. I will however try to answer the question in general terms. Yes, Django can be used to achieve this, but might be a bit overkill if that is the only purpose of the web application. </p>
<p>This can be done using flask and a mysql datbase. What you need is a form in HTML that posts to a function in python. </p>
<pre><code> &lt;form action="/INSERTFUNCTIONNAME" method="post"&gt;
     &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
          &lt;input type="text" attributeName="name" class="form-control" /&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>then define a function in python with the route "/INSERTFUNCTIONNAME"</p>
<pre><code>@webserver.route('/INSERTFUNCTIONNAME')
def test_home():
    if 'name' in request.form:
          do logic
          then return view with results
          return send_from_directory('', 'index.html')
</code></pre>
