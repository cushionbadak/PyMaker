<span class="comment-copy">From what source do you install?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am installing with the Windows graphical installer (64-bit) from the Anaconda website.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you ensure that you downloaded the proper Anaconda for the python version you want (python 2 or python 3)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, it is definitely the correct version for Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did try this several times, but it still gets the same error. A stupid question, but Anaconda comes with Python doesn't it? It doesn't need to be a serperate download?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. Anaconda comes with Python. No separate installation is required.</span>
