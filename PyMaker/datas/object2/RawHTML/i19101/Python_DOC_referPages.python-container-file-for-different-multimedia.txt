<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is my problem.
I need to combine text, picture and video (any codec) into one file.
I know there is binary files. How would I go about packaging and reading the file.
For example, In the one file I store the text, then the png and then the video.</p>
<p>In another Python file I extract the files again and display as I please.

<p>You could use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html" rel="nofollow">zipfile</a> module - it creates a single file from arbitrary components.</p>
<p>Sample usage (Python 3):</p>
<pre><code>import zipfile

# Write zip file
with zipfile.ZipFile("combined_file.zip", mode='w', compression=zipfile.ZIP_STORED) as archive:
    archive.write("file_1.ext")
    archive.write("file_2.ext")

# Extract contents later
with zipfile.ZipFile("combined_file.zip", mode='r') as archive:
    archive.extractall()
</code></pre>
