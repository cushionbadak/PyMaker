<p>I would like to disable the stack trace that is printed when there is an exception raised.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Looking around I found the following solution / workaround:</p>
<p>sys.tracebacklimit = 0</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There are no security reasons for disabling the stack trace.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the reason is not so important so I removed it.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">That doesn't solve what I'm worried about (you assuming it is beneficial for security).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I get that, but you wouldn't be the first to ask a question based on a faulty premise and would benefit more from correcting that assumption.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please dont. Having tracebacks is a GoodThing(tm). See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6598053/python-global-exception-handling" title="python global exception handling">stackoverflow.com/questions/6598053/â€¦</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.exception" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.exception</a> for the right way to keep the traceback private.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What you actually want is a custom <code>sys.excepthook</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">bruno, can you add an example for the way you can have an exception being logged without the stacktrace? you are welcome to add this as an  answer to this question</span>
