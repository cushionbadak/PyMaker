<p>I have a 2d dictionary where my data looks like:</p>
<pre><code>k1,k2, value
 1,2,0.8
 1,3,0.7
 1,5,0.9
 2,1,0.8

  and so on
</code></pre>
<p>So lets say I have this data in 2d dict..</p>
<pre><code>d[1][2] --&gt; gives 0.8
</code></pre>
<p>What I want is to reverse sort k2 for each k1 based on value</p>
<p>So for above.. what i am hoping to get after this operation is:</p>
<pre><code>1,5,0.9
1,2,0.8
1,3,0.7
2,1,0.8
</code></pre>
<p>and so on..</p>
<p>How do i achive the above in python </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This reverse-sorts on <code>k2</code> for each <code>k1</code>, which is what your question asks for:</p>
<pre><code>for k1, subdict in maindict.items():
    for k2, value in sorted(subdict.items(), reverse=True):
        print(k1, k2, value)
</code></pre>
<p>If you also want to forward-sort on <code>k1</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for k1, subdict in sorted(maindict.items()):
    for k2, value in sorted(subdict.items(), reverse=True):
        print(k1, k2, value)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to reverse-sort on <code>value</code> instead of <code>k2</code> (as your title asks for):</p>
<pre><code>for k1, subdict in maindict.items():
    for k2, value in sorted(subdict.items(), key=lambda (k, v): v, reverse=True):
        print(k1, k2, value)
</code></pre>
<p>Some explanation:</p>
<p>You can call <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted" rel="nofollow"><code>sorted</code></a> on any sequence to get a sorted version of it. You can pass <code>reverse=True</code> to almost any sorting-related function to sort it in reverse, and <code>key</code> to specify a function that generates a sorting key from each value. See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html" rel="nofollow">Sorting HOW TO</a> for details.</p>
<p>(The <code>lambda</code> function given above only works for Python 2.x. In 3.x, you can use <code>lambda kv: kv[1]</code>. Or you can just use <code>operator.itemgetter(1)</code>.)</p>
<p>And you can get a sequence of key-value pairs out of any mapping by calling its <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.items" rel="nofollow"><code>items</code></a> method. In Python 3.x, this gives you a nice efficient view; in 2.x, it copies the pairs into a <code>list</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, keep in mind that a <code>dict</code> has no inherent order.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The point of a dict is that it is unordered. If you want to create a new list of the values from your dict, and have those values sorted, that's a different thing. But you're not going to get a dictionary that has been sorted (unless you make yourself a sorted dict, which isn't actually that hard).</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Please post the dict.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your question seems contradictory. Do you want to reverse sort on <code>k2</code>, or on <code>value</code>? (Also, do you want to sort on <code>k1</code>, or just get them in arbitrary order?)</span>
