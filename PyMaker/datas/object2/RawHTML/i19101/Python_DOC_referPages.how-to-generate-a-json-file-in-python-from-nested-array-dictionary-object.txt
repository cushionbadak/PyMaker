<p>I need to generate a json file like:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "age":100,
  "name":"mkyong.com",
  "messages":["msg 1","msg 2","msg 3"]
}
</code></pre>
<p>The data in this file should be populated from various places. What is the best way to do this in python? I can always write as a text file (character by character). But I was wondering if there is a cleaner way by which an array could be created and use some library methods to generate this json file. Please suggest a good solution</p>
<p>PS. I am new to python</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>json.dumps()</code></a> for that. You can pass a dictionary to it and the function will encode it as json.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>import json

# example dictionary that contains data like you want to have in json
dic={'age': 100, 'name': 'mkyong.com', 'messages': ['msg 1', 'msg 2', 'msg 3']}

# get json string from that dictionary
json=json.dumps(dic)
print json
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>{"age": 100, "name": "mkyong.com", "messages": ["msg 1", "msg 2", "msg 3"]}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Try this out...</p>
<pre><code>import json
with open('data.json', 'w') as outfile:
    json.dump({
    "age":100,
    "name":"mkyong.com",
    "messages":["msg 1","msg 2","msg 3"]
     }, outfile)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Use the builtin <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">json library</a> on your object...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But my input is not a json string</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you want then? You want the indentation? You want to load json data? For all those, use the builtin json library I wrote above</span>
