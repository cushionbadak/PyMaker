<p>I want to do multiple comparisons for a logical condition in python but I am not sure of the right way round for the <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>. I have 2 statements. </p>
<p>Statement 1:</p>
<pre><code>#if PAB is more than BAC and either PAB is less than PAC or PAC is more than BAC
if PAB &gt; BAC and PAB&lt; PAC or PAB &gt; BAC and PAC&gt;BAC: 
</code></pre>
<p>Statement 2:</p>
<pre><code>#if PAB is more than BAC and PAC is less than PAB or if PAB is less than BAC and PAC is less than BAC
if PAB &gt;BAC and  PAC&lt;PAB or PAB&lt;BAC and  PAC&lt;BAC
</code></pre>
<p>Is or-ing the two ands the correct way to go about it?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Looking at statement 1, I'm assuming you mean:</p>
<pre><code>if (PAB &gt; BAC and PAB&lt; PAC) or (PAB &gt; BAC and PAC&gt;BAC): 
</code></pre>
<p>In which case, I'd probably write it like this (using <em>chained comparisons</em>, docs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/expressions.html#comparisons" rel="noreferrer">python2</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons" rel="noreferrer">python3</a>):</p>
<pre><code>if (BAC &lt; PAB &lt; PAC) or min(PAB,PAC)&gt;BAC:
</code></pre>
<p>You can use an analogous form for statement 2.</p>
<p>Having said that, I cannot make your comments in the question's code match up with my interpretation of your conditionals, so it's plausible I don't understand your requirement.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>PAB &gt; BAC and PAB&lt; PAC</code> is better written as <code>BAC &lt; PAB &lt; PAC</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>PAB</code>, <code>PAC</code> and <code>BAC</code> are angles of 3 triangles with common vertices. <code>PAB &gt; BAC and PAB&lt; PAC</code> can definitely be true.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@markmcmurray: I misread that as <code>a &lt; b and b &lt; a</code> - your variable names are too confusing!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Eric The variable names aren't confusing. A, B and C are points on a triangle, or something along those lines.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Eric They're not confusing in the context of how I am using them with triangles where the vertices are single letters (eg A,B,C,P)</span>
