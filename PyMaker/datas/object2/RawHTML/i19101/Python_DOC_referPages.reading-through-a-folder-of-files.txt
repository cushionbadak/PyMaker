<p>I am assigned to write a program that catches plagiarists. Given a folder of files, how would I iterate through them file-by-file, constructing a list of all 6-word phrases in each file. An example of this is</p>
<p>Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. </p>
<p>Contains the 6-word phrases: 
Now is the time for all, 
is the time for all good, 
the time for all good men,
time for all good men to, 
...and so on.</p>
<pre><code>ExampleFile=F.read('File')
index1=0
index2=5
List1=[]
while True:
     index1+=1
     index2+=1
     List1+= Examplefile[index1:index2]
</code></pre>
<p>Is what I have so far to create the lists of 6 word phrases. How then would I go about doing this for each file and then comparing those results to see if any two files have over 200 of the same phrases? I have done very little with using files in Python so dumb everything down as much as possible. Thanks!</p>

<p>Since it's homework, I think a couple of links will help you more than complete code.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir" rel="nofollow"><code>os.listdir</code></a> that lists all files in a folder and <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow"><code>os.walk</code></a> that traverses a directory tree.</p>
<p>Then you can make a list where each item is a container of phrases. I suggest using a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset" rel="nofollow"><code>set</code></a> of phrases for each file, and a list of such sets, or maybe a <code>set</code> of <code>frozenset</code>s.</p>
<p>Then you can take all pairwise combinations of those sets with <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.combinations</code></a> and compute the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set.intersection" rel="nofollow">intersection</a> for each pair. If the size of any intersection is above the threshold, you've found the plagiarist.</p>
<hr/>
<p>A comment on your current code: there is a naming convention that variable names should start with lowercase letters, and capitalized names are used for classes.</p>
