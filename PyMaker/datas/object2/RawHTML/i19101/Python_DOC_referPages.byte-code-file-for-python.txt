<p>I am unable to see Compiled Python File (Byte Code) on my hard drive.
I can only see script file with py extension but no Compiled file with pyc extension</p>

<p>Only imported modules get a byte-code cache, a <code>.pyc</code> file. For the main script file, the one you run first, <em>no</em> byte cache file is created.</p>
<p>Bytecode cache files are only created if Python has write access to the file system.</p>
<p>For Python 3.2 newer, these bytecode files have been moved to a subdirectory called <code>__pycache__</code>, see <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3147/" rel="noreferrer">PEP 3147</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not see a <code>.pyc</code> file for your python code, check that you:</p>
<ol>
<li>you are dealing with a module, not the main script.</li>
<li>Python has write access to the filesystem</li>
<li>for Python 3.2 or newer, that you didn't miss out on the <code>__pycache__</code> directory</li>
<li>that you didn't run Python with the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#miscellaneous-options" rel="noreferrer"><code>-B</code> command line switch</a> disabling bytecode cache writing. </li>
