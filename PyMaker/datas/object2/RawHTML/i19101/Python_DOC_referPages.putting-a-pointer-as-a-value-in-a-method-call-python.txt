<p>I'm trying to have a function where I can put in a list and a pointer, and have it apply that pointer to the objects in the list to give me the object with the lowest value of that pointer.</p>
<pre><code>def GetLowest(ListObject,Value):

    ObjectX=ListObject[0]

    for i in ListObject:

        if i.Value&lt;=ObjectX.Value:

            ObjectX=i

    return ObjectX
</code></pre>
<p>Then I could do things like (assuming I have lists of these objects) <code>GetLowest(Rectangles,Area)</code> and have it check the area of each rectangle. Or maybe something more complex like <code>GetLowest(Backpacks,Wearer.ShoeSize)</code>.</p>
<p>I'm going to want to use this in a few places around my program.
Thanks in advance, guys!</p>

<p>It looks to me like you would like to use the builtin <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min" rel="nofollow"><code>min</code></a> function.  <code>min</code> takes an iterable (e.g. a list) and returns the minumum element.  You can also give it a <code>key</code> function which is called to do the comparison.</p>
<p>e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>smallest_rectangle = min(list_of_rectangles,key=lambda rect:rect.area)
backpack_with_small_shoes = min(backpacks,key=lambda b: b.wearer.shoe_size)
</code></pre>
<p>The various functions in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.attrgetter" rel="nofollow"><code>operator</code></a> module are really useful here too.  For example, the first statement above could be written as:</p>
<pre><code>from operator import attrgetter
smallest_rectangle = min(list_of_rectangles,key=attrgetter('area'))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't think ordinary Python has pointers. Do you mean attributes?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I figured there was probably some built-in function I was missing. I just tried the min thing and it worked first try. Thanks a million!</span>
