<p>I am trying to create a utility program, but after the user types in the passcode and goes to the main menu, the passcode is still there and is show right above it. I asked this question before, but users gave me a command instead of something the script does for you. I was wondering if there is something I can type into my script that can clear the python shell without having to directly type it into the shell.</p>

<p>You should use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass" rel="nofollow"><code>getpass</code></a> to read passwords without echoing them, that's the reccomended way of reading passwords safely.</p>

<p>If you are using Linux:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.system("clear")
</code></pre>
<p>if you are using windows:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.system('CLS')
</code></pre>
<p>Note: you should really not do something like this with passcodes for security reasons, but this does clear the shell</p>

<span class="comment-copy">why do you show the passcode? even if you clear the screen it will be visible while typed...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if people gave you a command, can't you use that command with <code>os.system</code> to clear it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This works for me. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I use it, it only restarts it.It doesn't erase it for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What system do you use? I just updated because I only included the Linux/mac terminal approach, if you are using windows try that</span>
