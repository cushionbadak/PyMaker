<p>I'm a beginner user for Python, but I get confused between literal and variables.</p>
<p>This is what I know about a literal: <code>"a"+"b"</code> </p>
<p>And variables: <code>sentence="a"+"b"</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A literal is notation for representing a fixed (<code>const</code>) value.<br/>
A variable is storage location associated with a symbolic name (pointed to, if you'd like).</p>
<p>It's best explained in use:</p>
<pre><code>foo = bar(42)
^     ^   ^
|     |   |--- literal, 42 is *literally* 42
|     |------- function, also represents "something" in memory
|------------- variable, named "foo", and the content may vary (is variable)
</code></pre>

<p>In any programming language a Literal is a constant value, where as identifiers can change their values. Identifiers can store literals and process them further. Identifiers are name given to variables.</p>
<p><code>1</code>, <code>1.5</code>, <code>'a'</code>, <code>"abc"</code>, etc. are examples for literals. But in the statement <code>x=123</code>, x is a variable and 123 is a Literal.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should really read the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Tutorial</a> at least.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>"a"</code> and <code>"b"</code> are literals. <code>"a" + "b"</code> is an expression</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A variable is something that can vary. A literal is stating it literally!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">An identifier is not a variable. An identifier may be the <i>name</i> of a variable.</span>
