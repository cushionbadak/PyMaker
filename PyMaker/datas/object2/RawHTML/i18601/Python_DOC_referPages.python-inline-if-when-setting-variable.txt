<p>In Java, setting a variable to a value based on a condition could be done in one line 
like so:</p>
<pre><code>variable = (!true) ? 1 : 2
</code></pre>
<p>This would result to '2'.</p>
<p>Is there python equivalent to this code?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>variable =  1 if not True else 2
</code></pre>
<p>General ternary syntax:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;value_if_true&gt; if &lt;condition&gt; else &lt;value_if_false&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is called a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="nofollow">conditional expression</a> in Python, and is mostly equivalent to the "ternary operator" in C-family languages (although it's not actually an operator). The original proposal <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/" rel="nofollow">PEP 308</a> has more details.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">For future reference, this is known as the ternary operator. That term should be much more search-friendly than "inline if".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Given that <code>!true</code> is a constant, the easiest way to write this in one line is <code>variable = 2</code>. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112: Actually, in Python, it's called a "conditional expression", and <code>if</code> is explicitly <i>not</i> an operator. However, after a bit of resistance, they relented and added <code>sometimes called a "ternary operator"</code> to <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a> because that's what everyone coming from C-family languages searches for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert That was just an example. The conditional in there can be anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Yoni201: I was pretty sure of that, which is why I put it as a comment (with a stupid smiley) rather than an answer.</span>
