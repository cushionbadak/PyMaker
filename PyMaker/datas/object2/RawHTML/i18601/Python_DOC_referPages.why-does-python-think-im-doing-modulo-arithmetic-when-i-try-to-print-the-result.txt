<p>I am trying to create a class using PyDev in Eclipse, but when I try to run as Python I get an error:  <code>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'NoneType' and 'int'</code>.</p>
<p>I've tried to select all text, then go under the source menu and select "correct indentation", but I could not find that option in my Eclipse.</p>
<p>How can I fix this problem in Python 3?</p>
<p>Here's the code (transcribed from <a href="http://nsa34.casimages.com/img/2013/07/24/130724042040537979.jpg" rel="nofollow">here</a>):</p>
<pre><code>class Employee:
    empCount = 0

    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary
        Employee.empCount += 1

    def displayCount(self):
        print("Total Employee %d") % Employee.empCount

    def displayEmployee(self):
        print ("Name:"), self.name, "Salary: ", self.salary

def main():
    emp1 = Employee("Zara", 2000)
    emp2 = Employee("Manni", 5000)
    emp1.displayEmployee()
    emp2.displayEmployee()
    print("Total Employee %d") % Employee.empCount

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

<p>No, indentation problems aren't your concern - the way you're printing out your information is.</p>
<p>In Python3, <code>print()</code> is now a function which returns <code>None</code> when done, then applying some operator to <code>None</code>, hence your exception.</p>
<p>I notice that you're attempting to do the old style of string formatting by using the <code>%</code> operator to specify when the formatting begins - the use of this in Python 3 is discouraged.</p>
<p>Here's how you get past it:  <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow">use the curly-brace notation and call <code>.format()</code></a> with the parameters you want to format.  It's positional, so multiple curly braces will format multiple arguments.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>def displayEmployee(self):
    print ("Name: {}, Salary: {:d}".format(self.name, self.salary))
</code></pre>
<p>That's the most complex of your print statements; I feel that you can get the rest from here.</p>

<p>The problem is you have close the print function before entering all arguments, you should do the following:
 print("Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount) &lt;-</p>
<p>By the way, in python 3, print have a new syntax and it requires parenthesis, so: </p>
<pre><code>print ("Name:"), self.name, "Salary: ", self.salary
</code></pre>
<p>You have to write</p>
<pre><code>print ("Name:", self.name, "Salary: ", self.salary)
</code></pre>
<p>I hope it works</p>

<p>You have no indentation problems.</p>
<p>You are using three spaces to indent instead of four. This is not a problem for Python, but Eclipse thinks you should use four and puts wavy lines under it. If you can't get Eclipse to fix that, simply just use four spaces instead.</p>
