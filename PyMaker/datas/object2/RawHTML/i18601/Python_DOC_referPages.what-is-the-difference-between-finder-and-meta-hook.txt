<p>Here <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#import-hooks" rel="nofollow">import-hooks</a> it is written that <em>meta hooks</em> are registered in <code>sys.meta_path</code>. Also in this list there are kept <em>finders</em>. So what is the difference between <em>meta hook</em> and <em>finder</em>? Are they the same thing? And why are they kept in the same place?</p>

<p>The document you're quoting says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meta hooks are registered by adding new finder objects to sys.meta_path</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I'd say yes, they're the same thing.</p>

<p>They are subtlety different. This <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow">document</a> provides a thorough discussion of the import machinery.</p>
<p>Meta hooks are called at the start of import processing. As a result, they can become involved in all types of imports including imports such as builtin modules or frozen modules as well as the start of handling disk based module location via <code>sys.path</code>. Basically, at this level</p>
<p>Path hooks are invoked later in import processing during the processing of each <code>sys.path</code> entry. They have the opportunity to return an object that will take full responsibility for locating modules in that particular path entry. For example, if <code>sys.path</code> contains <code>[/usr/lib/Python3, /home/user/mypython]</code>, you could provide a path hook which would be able to do non-standard stuff to locate modules in your project <code>mypython</code></p>
<p>Both hooks allow you to supply a <code>finder</code> which can take complete responsibility for locating modules in specific contexts. For example, a meta path hook is used to import modules from <code>zip</code> files.</p>
