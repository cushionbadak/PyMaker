<p>I'm new to Python and have been working through some tutorials to try to get to grips with different aspects of programming.</p>
<p>I'm stuck on an exercise that is most likely very simple however I am unable to find the solution.</p>
<p>How do I create a program that reads one line of input and prints out the same line two times?</p>
<p>For example if the input was <code>Echo</code> it would print:</p>
<pre><code>Echo
Echo
</code></pre>
<p>Any help with this would be hugely appreciated. I think I'm making a simple logic error but don't yet have the skills in place to recognise what it is.</p>

<p>The other answers seem logical enough, but what if you wanted to print it let's say a 1000 times or a million times? Are you really going to be typing print(variable) a million types? Here is a faster way:</p>
<pre><code>                               j=input("Enter anything.")
                               for i in range(2):
                                print(j)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, I can change the value of range to whatever I want, and J will be printed that many times. </p>
<p>What happens here, is that the variable i loops upwards (an increment) to the number 2, so to explain it to a beginner, i travels t=from number to number. Where I put print(j) for every number i loops through until it gets to 2, J will be printed.</p>

<p>It sounds like you've been doing the input and output in one go:</p>
<pre><code>print(input())
</code></pre>
<p>That works for doing a single echo of the input, but makes it a bit harder to repeat the same thing twice. An easy workaround would be to save the inputted text to a variable, which you can print twice:</p>
<pre><code>text = input()
print(text)
print(text)
</code></pre>
<p>If you needed to do the input and doubled output with a single statement, you could use string formatting to duplicate the text with a newline in the middle:</p>
<pre><code>print("{0}\n{0}".format(input()))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>way complex right?(:D)</p>
<pre><code>inp = input("Input something would ya? ")
print(inp)
print(inp)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Ive tried creating a variable as shown in your example above however when I run the program it will only print the variable once despite me asking to print it twice. What would I need to write to get it to print the variable twice on 2 seperate lines?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2633836 The above code <i>will</i> print it twice... Have you tried just copying and pasting it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have tried copying and pasting it. It just refuses to print the word out twice. I have tried text = input("Echo") print(text) print(text) but this will only print Echo once using the string formatting how would I write the code? text = input("Echo") print("{0}\n{0}".format(input("Echo"))) is this correct?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ive done it thank you both for you assistance really appreciate it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2633836: <code>input("Echo")</code> doesn't get <code>"Echo"</code> as input, rather it prints <code>"Echo"</code> as a prompt and then waits for the user to type in their own text.
