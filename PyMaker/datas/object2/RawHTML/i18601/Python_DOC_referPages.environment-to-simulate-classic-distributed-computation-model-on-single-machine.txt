<p>I'm searching for a tool to simulate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_algorithm" rel="nofollow">classic distributed computation model</a> on a single machine to implement several algorithms in the purpose of the paper that I'm working on. Thus, performance isn't so important, it's only for scientific applications.</p>
<p>I want to have the possibility to specify the number of processes and the communication links between them. In other words, I want to define the network graph structure.</p>
<p>The computation should be asynchronous and message driven i.e. I want to send messages between connected processes and react to these messages.</p>
<p>Is there any library or framework for such computations? Simpler is better. Language doesn't matter so much, but I'd prefer Python or C++. I've given a look at <a href="http://celeryproject.org/" rel="nofollow">Celery</a> but I didn't find there the possibility to specify the connection between processes.</p>

<p>Very easy - python remote objects - <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pyro4" rel="nofollow">pyro</a> will run on a single machine or on multiple across a network.</p>

<p>You might also stick to python multiprocessing primitives, that allow you to create processes that communicate via queues, shared memory etc. Way easier than it seems ;) </p>
