<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>x and y are two variables.<br/>
I can check if they're equal using <code>x == y</code>, but how can I check if they have the same identity?</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>x == y</code> is True because x and y are equal, however, x and y aren't the same object.<br/>
I'm looking for something like <code>sameObject(x, y)</code> which in that case is supposed to be False. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>is</code> to check if two objects have the same identity.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x == y
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; x is y
False
</code></pre>

<p>To build on the answer from Mark Byers:</p>
<p>The <code>is</code> evaluation will work when the variables contain objects and not primitive types.  </p>
<pre><code>object_one = ['d']
object_two = ['d']
assert thing_one is thing_two  # False

primitive_one = 'd'
primitive_two = 'd'
assert primitive_one is primitive_two  # True
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to compare primitives as well, I'd suggest using the builtin <code>id()</code> function.<br/>
From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the “identity” of an object. This is an integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that will become this:</p>
<pre><code>assert id(primitive_one) == id(primitive_two)  # False
</code></pre>
</div>
