<p><code>pydoc</code> does not work in Windows. at this post <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3391998/pydoc-is-not-working-windows-xp">Pydoc is not working (Windows XP)</a> the last answer by dave webb says to create a <strong>pydoc.bat</strong> file with this code in it:</p>
<pre><code>@python c:\Python27\Lib\pydoc.py %*
</code></pre>
<p>After I create pydoc.bat where should it be placed so the <code>pydoc</code> command works in the command prompt?</p>
<p><em>PS</em> adding <code>C:\python27\Lib\pydoc.py</code> to the Windows path in the system environment variables does not work. Even after logging out and back in it does not work. </p>

<p>The <code>PATH</code> environment variable is a list of <em>directories</em> to search for a given executable.  So you should be adding <code>C:\python27\Lib</code> to your <code>PATH</code> (not including the <em>filename</em>).</p>
<p>As for the <code>pydoc.bat</code> file you've created, one place to put it would be the <code>C:\python27\Scripts</code> directory which is usually added to your <code>PATH</code> by the python installation (since that folder contains miscellaneous scripts that you might like available at the command line).</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>python -m pydoc os</code> instead of <code>pydoc</code> directly, no need to add to path variable.</p>
<p>the -m tells python that pydoc is a pre-built module in python and NOT a script (.py file) sitting in the current working folder.</p>

<p>I have found in windows 10 powershell...</p>
<p>Remember to access pydoc in windows, it's 
python -m pydoc.  If you want to access info on "file", add the word "file"
after. Like this "python -m pydoc file" (*w/o the quotes). </p>
<p>What 
you type after python -m pydoc, will tell it what info you want brought up
and/or looking for.  i.e. python -m pydoc raw_input, python -m pydoc string, python -m pydoc file. </p>
<p>Remmeber python -m pydoc must be in front of what you are looking for.</p>

<p>put it in any folder that is in your PATH. Example: <code>C:\Windows\System32</code></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can put it anywhere, and then add <em>the folder</em> it is in to windows PATH</p>

<p>If you add .PY to your <code>PATHEXT</code> environment variable, you don't need the batch script. Just add <code>C:\Python27\Lib</code> to <code>PATH</code>, and you're all set.</p>

<p>As an example for Raw_input, try: python -m pydoc raw_input</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you double click on a <code>*.py</code> file in Windows Explorer does it start running or is something else happening, e.g. the file is opened in an editor? Also as far as I can see, this question has been already answered. Maybe you should comment over there if you're not happy with those answers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">a command prompt style window pops up for a fraction of a second and disappears when i double click a *.py file. i have not seen this question answered over here <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3391998/pydoc-is-not-working-windows-xp" title="pydoc is not working windows xp">stackoverflow.com/questions/3391998/â€¦</a> but I will comment there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the only Scripts folder I found is in C:\python27\Tools\Scripts. is this the same one you are referring to?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That sounds right -- I have python 2.5, so it may have changed.  That should probably be in your path already, or you can put it there if it isn't.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it worked but to get it to work I had to place pydoc.bat in C:\python27\Tools\Scripts not C:\python27\Scripts cause that DIR doesn't exist for me. thanks :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can also start pydoc server with this command <code>python -m pydoc -p 8080</code>. Then go to <a href="http://localhost:8080" rel="nofollow noreferrer">localhost:8080</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It also works on Windows!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, this is what I was looking for</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem going by the accepted answer seems to be that the path environment variable needed to be updated.</span>
