<p>How to split this string where <code>__</code> is the delimiter</p>
<pre><code>MATCHES__STRING
</code></pre>
<p>To get an output of <code>['MATCHES', 'STRING']</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="noreferrer"><code>str.split</code></a> function: <code>string.split('__')</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "MATCHES__STRING".split("__")
['MATCHES', 'STRING']

<p>You may be interested in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code></a> module, which is designed for comma-separated files but can be easily modified to use a custom delimiter.</p>
<pre><code>import csv
csv.register_dialect( "myDialect", delimiter = "__", &lt;other-options&gt; )
lines = [ "MATCHES__STRING" ]

for row in csv.reader( lines ):
    ...
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you have two or more (in the example below there're three) elements in the string, then you can use comma to separate these items:</p>
<pre><code>date, time, event_name = ev.get_text(separator='@').split("@")
</code></pre>
<p>After this line of code, the three variables will have values from three parts of the variable <strong>ev</strong></p>
<p>So, if the variable ev contains this string and we apply separator '@':</p>
<p>Sa., 23. März@19:00@Klavier + Orchester: SPEZIAL</p>
<p>Then, after split operation the variable</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>date</strong> will have value "Sa., 23. März"</li>
<li><strong>time</strong> will have value "19:00"</li>
<li><strong>event_name</strong> will have value "Klavier + Orchester: SPEZIAL"</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">It is worth to read the python standard documents and trying to understand few programs others have made to start to grasp basics of Python. Practise and copying/modifying are great tools to learn language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was wondering, what is the difference between the first example (simply using split()) and the second example (with a for loop)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EndenDragon The for loop will automatically apply <code>x.strip()</code> and return a list of matches without whitespace on either side. The devil is in the details.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey, since this is a very popular question, I edited it to ask only 1 specific question and removed the part with the spaces around the delimiter because it wasn't clear what the OP even expected to happen (Since there never was a question in the question). I think the question (and answers) are more useful this way, but feel free to rollback all the edits if you disagree.</span>
