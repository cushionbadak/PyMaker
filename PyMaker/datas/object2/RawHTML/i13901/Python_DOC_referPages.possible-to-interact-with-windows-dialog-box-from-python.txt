<p>So I've had a good look around, and this is the closest I could find to what I need to do:

<p>But it's only part of it.</p>
<p>So I have a script that needs to run fully automated. Currently it's being stopped by a Windows dialog box prompting the user to click 'OK'.</p>
<p>Is it possible to register some sort of handler that when a dialog box opens is fired and selects the 'OK' option for it? Any ideas how to do this/where I can get futher info on it?</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> My goal isn't just to keep the code going, a requirement is to select 'OK' on the dialog box before continuing.</p>

<p>You have to create a <code>thread</code> in the background. Different threads may run at one time. Dialog box stops current thread and waits while user make a choice. This is normal behavior.</p>
<p>Python has very easy threading API. Thread is function that is passed as an argument to a thread class constructor. Thread executes this function then, and you may start several threads, they will not lock the current thread. Move your dialog or background code to a separate thread.</p>

<p>Making program automatically select OK in that dialog box is not possible for a Python program. Well, there are several techniques, but they require C++ and other extended skills.</p>

<p>There is a package called <a href="https://github.com/glitchassassin/lackey" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Lackey</a> which can scan the screen for a predefined pattern (the image of the Dialog in this case) then type the keyboard ('Enter' in this case).</p>
<p>It is a python implementation of Sikuli. So all supporting docs can be found <a href="http://www.Sikuli.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should rename this question to <code>Changing windows application dialog box behavior from Python</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks like that's definitely the right track. Although closing the dialog before continuing is part of the required functionality (I just added a note in the question clarifying this).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can kill the process using shell just like you create it, from any thread if you need, but you cannot change the behavior of program (do you have source code?). Updated the answer @user3420034</span>
<span class="comment-copy">From the looks of this article surely it is: <a href="http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/23100-windows-dialog-box-removal" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bytes.com/topic/python/answers/23100-windows-dialog-box-removal</a> I'm just unsure of how to implement this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3420034 this is the worst you can do with python, stop it. write a C app for this and use it in your python application if so.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't have the luxury of that, the spec of my project requires it to be done in Python. If you're unsure what the solution is no worries, but comments like this are incredibly unhelpful - I'm aware that in .NET-based languages this is trivial.</span>
