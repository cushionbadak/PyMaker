<p>I need to make sure that all the conditions are met, with a special case. The student is still deemed 'eligible' even if either the 'before2010' or 'gerequirements' aren't met.</p>
<p>However, I can't get the program to work properly. I want to be able to type 'y', 'yes', 'n', or 'no' for the answers to the yes/no questions, but it comes off as an error, because I didn't assign 'y' apparently.</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    credits = int(input("Enter the total number of credits completed: "))
    udcredits = int(input("Enter the number of upper-division credits completed: "))
    localcredits = int(input("Enter the number of local credits completed: "))
    mrequirements = input("Have you completed all major requirements? ")
    before2010 = eval(input("In what year did you matriculate? "))
    gerequirements = input("Are your general education requirements done? ")

    if before2010 &lt; 2010 and credits &gt;= 120 and udcredits &gt;= 40 and localcredits &gt;= 30 and mrequirements[0] == y:
        print("eligible")
    else:
        print("ineligible")

    if gerequirements[0] == y and credits &gt;= 120 and udcredits &gt;= 40 and localcredits &gt;= 30 and mrequirements[0] == y:
        print("eligible")

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>gerequirements[0] == y
</code></pre>
<p>This line will not compile.  If you're trying to match the character <code>y</code> you have to wrap it in quotes to denote a string.  Without quotes, Python expects <code>y</code> to be a variable.</p>
<p>So the expression becomes:</p>
<pre><code>gerequirements[0] == 'y'
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>As the commenters have mentioned, there's several other problems with your code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prefer <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/4915361/113632"><code>raw_input</code> to <code>input</code></a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1832940/113632">Never use <code>eval</code></a>, certainly not on user input; in your case you probably want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>int()</code></a>.</li>
<li>You should <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/6797984/113632">lower-case</a> your yes/no inputs to allow users to type in upper or lower case.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your full code would be:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    credits = int(input("Enter the total number of credits completed: "))
    udcredits = int(input("Enter the number of upper-division credits completed: "))
    localcredits = int(input("Enter the number of local credits completed: "))
    mrequirements = input("Have you completed all major requirements? ")
    before2010 = int(input("In what year did you matriculate? "))
    gerequirements = input("Are your general education requirements done? ")

    if before2010 &lt; 2010 and credits &gt;= 120 and udcredits &gt;= 40 and localcredits &gt;= 30 and mrequirements[0].lower() == 'y':
        print("eligible")
    else:
        print("ineligible")

    if gerequirements[0].lower() == 'y' and credits &gt;= 120 and udcredits &gt;= 40 and localcredits &gt;= 30 and mrequirements[0].lower() == 'y':
        print("eligible")
    else:
        print("ineligible")

main()
</code></pre>
<p><strong>CHANGES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Line 6, changed <code>eval()</code> to <code>int()</code> safer this way, better practice</p></li>
<li><p>Line 9 &amp; 14 added <code>.lower()</code> to <strong>mrequirements[0]</strong> and <strong>gerequirements[0]</strong> so that even if the user typed a capital Y the test woud still pass.</p></li>
<li>Line 9 &amp; 14 Added quotes to <code>"y"</code> since it's saved as a string from the input() function in Python. Otherwise the <code>if</code> statement wouldn't return true</li>
</ul>
<p>It should run fine now.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you using Python 2?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also <code>gerequirements[0] == 'y'</code> make sure you get the quotes in there. You're probably expecting a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am using python 3. Setting that with apostrophes got it running, now I'm just stuck on how to make the code do the correct output according to the input answers.</span>
