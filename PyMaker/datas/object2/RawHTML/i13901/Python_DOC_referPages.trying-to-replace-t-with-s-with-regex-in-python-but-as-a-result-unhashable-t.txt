<p>I am new to programming and have already checked other people's questions to make sure that I am using a good method to replace tabs with spaces, know my regex is correct, and also understand what exactly my error is ("Unhashable type 'list'). But even still, I'm at a loss of what to do. Any help would be great! </p>
<p>I have a large file that I have broken up into lines. Ultimately I will need to access the first 3 elements of each line. Currently when I print a line, without the additional re.sub line of code, I get something like this: ['blah\tblah\tblah'], when I want ['blah blah blah'].</p>
<p>My code to do this is</p>
<pre><code>f = open(text.txt)
raw = f.read()
raw = raw.lower()

lines = raw.splitlines()
lines = re.sub(r'\t', lines, '\s')

print lines[0:2] #just to see the first few examples

f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>When I print the first few lines without the regex sub bit, it works fine. And then when I add that line in attempt to change the lines, I get the error. I understand that <em>lists</em> are changeable and thus can't be a hashed... but I'm not trying to work with a hash. I'm just trying to replace \t with \s in a large text file to make the program easier to work with. I don't think there is a problem with how I am changing \t's to \s's, because according to this error, any way I change it will break my code. What do I do?! Any help is super appreciated. :') </p>

<p>You need to change the order of params present inside the <code>re.sub</code> function. And also note that you can't use regex <code>\s</code> as a second param in <code>re.sub</code> function. Syntax of re.sub must be <code>re.sub(regex,replacement,string)</code> .</p>
<pre><code>lines = raw.splitlines()
lines = [re.sub(r'\t', ' ', line) for line in lines]
</code></pre>
<p><code>raw.splitlines()</code> returns a list which was then assigned to a variable called <code>lines</code>. So you need to apply the <code>re.sub</code> function to each item present in the list, since <code>re.sub</code> won't directly be applied on a list.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This worked! Thank you so much! Can you explain why I need the "for line in lines" bit as well? Shouldn't it apply it globally without this bit?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">lines is an array of string. regex work on string, not on an array</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To be precise, <code>lines</code>is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list</code></a>, not an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>array</code></a>.</span>
