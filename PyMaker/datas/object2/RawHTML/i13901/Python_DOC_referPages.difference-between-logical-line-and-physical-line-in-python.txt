<p>I was reading and i got these two terms and i am confused as in logical line it says "The end of a logical line is represented by the token NEWLINE".
Newline means go to the next line which eventually ends the line.</p>
<p>And in physical line its written "A physical line is a sequence of characters terminated by an end-of-line sequence". so the same thing happens when we use newline with logical line. so what is the difference?</p>

<p>Here is one logical and physical line:</p>
<pre><code>my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>Here is one logical line on two physical lines:</p>
<pre><code>my_list = [1, 2,
           3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>Two or more physical lines may be joined into logical lines using backslash characters (), as follows: when a physical line ends in a backslash that is not part of a string literal or comment, it is joined with the following forming a single logical line, deleting the backslash and the following end-of-line character.</p>
<pre><code>if 1900 &lt; year &lt; 2100 and 1 &lt;= month &lt;= 12 \
and 1 &lt;= day &lt;= 31 and 0 &lt;= hour &lt; 24 \
and 0 &lt;= minute &lt; 60 and 0 &lt;= second &lt; 60:   # Looks like a valid date
return 1
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A line ending in a backslash cannot carry a comment.</li>
<li>A backslash does not continue a comment.</li>
<li>A backslash does not continue a token except for string literals (i.e., tokens other than string literals cannot be split across physical lines using a backslash).</li>
<li>A backslash is illegal elsewhere on a line outside a string literal.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you write a program , what you see is considered to be a <code>physical line</code>.</p>
<p><code>Logical line</code> refers to a single statement what python sees.</p>
<p>An example of a logical line is a statement like print 'Hello World!'.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">but the second one has invalid syntax if i am not wrong</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hint: try it out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, you are right it works... thank you</span>
