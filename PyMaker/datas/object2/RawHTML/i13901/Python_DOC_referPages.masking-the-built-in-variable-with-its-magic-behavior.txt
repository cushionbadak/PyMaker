<p>I am not able to follow this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers" rel="nofollow">statement in python tutorials</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This variable should be treated as read-only by the user. Don’t explicitly assign a value to it — you would create an independent local variable with the same name masking the built-in variable with its magic behavior.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In the interactive prompt, <code>_</code> has "magic" behavior -- it gets set to the value of whatever expression was evaluated last:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 + 3
6
&gt;&gt;&gt; _
6
</code></pre>
<p>If, however, you assign something to a variable named <code>_</code> yourself, then you only "see" that variable, and the magic variable is hidden ("masked"):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; _ = 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 + 3
6
&gt;&gt;&gt; _
3
</code></pre>
<p>This happens because your local variable <code>_</code> is unrelated to the variable that has the magic behavior, it just happens to have the same name.</p>
<p>So don't do that, not in the interactive prompt anyway.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It means exactly what it says it means; you should not assign anything to the <code>_</code> variable as that would hide the <em>real</em> magic variable:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 1
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; _
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; _ = 'foo'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 2
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; _
'foo'
</code></pre>
<p>The magic <code>_</code> variable stores the result of the last expression that was echoed, but by assigning to <code>_</code> you no longer can 'see' this magic variable. Looking up <code>_</code> shows whatever value I assigned to it now.</p>
<p>Luckily, you can also <em>delete</em> the shadowing <code>_</code> name again:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; del _
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 2
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; _
4
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">1. your link doesn't work. 2. the explanation looks pretty straight forward, in case you don't know what 'masking' or 'shadowing' is, you can read more here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What part don't you follow? They explain what the <code>_</code> magic variable in the interactive interpreter does.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I had to upvote only because of: "It means exactly what it says it means" :) (well, not 'only' but...)</span>
