<p>I am learnig python for the beginning, I am doing some tutorials and video-tutorials. I am using sublime text 3 for wrinting code and the console of sublimeREPL to run the files and the code. 
a few days ago I had to search on the web how to make sublimeREPL to run as IDLE 3 runs, and i made it. </p>
<p>The problem right now is that in the lesson i am doing right now they are teaching me how to use tkinter but in the videos the guy codes:</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter import *
colorchooser.askcolor()
</code></pre>
<p>and it works, but when i code that , it doesn't work. the error says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last): File "", line 1, in 
  NameError: name 'colorchooser' is not defined</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I need to code :</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter import colorchooser
colorchooser.askcolor()
</code></pre>
<p>and it works.</p>
<p>I just need to know why do I have to do it like this?, and why doesn't it work for me in the first way?</p>
<p>I not a English Speaker I tried my best.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>With</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter import colorchooser
</code></pre>
<p>you are importing the (sub-)<strong>module</strong> <code>colorchooser</code> (plus its variables and functions) from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages" rel="nofollow"><strong>package</strong></a> (which is a structured module) <code>tkinter</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Packages are a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using “dotted module names”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the module <code>tkinter</code> is structured as follows:</p>
<pre><code>tkinter/
    colorchooser/
        askcolor()
        ...
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>from tkinter import *</code> you are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package" rel="nofollow">importing all <strong>methods</strong> and <strong>variables</strong></a> from <code>tkinter</code> (in fact all public objects not starting with <code>_</code>), <strong>but not its submodules</strong>, this is why the two methods are not the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the statement <code>from sound.effects import *</code> does not import all submodules from the package sound.effects into the current namespace</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package" rel="nofollow">source</a>)</p>
<p>You can, however (even though many would say <code>from ... import *</code> is bad practice)</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter.colorchooser import *
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>from tkinter import * doesn't work because you need the entire tkinter directory. 
This is why you must specificy colorchooser module for your program to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am not sure where you saw that , but <code>colorchooser</code> has always been a module inside <code>tkinter</code> and it does not get imported when you do -</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter import *
</code></pre>
<p>You have to specifically import it using -</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter import colorchooser
</code></pre>
<p>As you already observed.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Seems like the python version in video is different (probably older) than yours. Does this work for you: <code>from tkinter import *</code> <code>tkinter.colorchooser.askcolor()</code>? Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3.5/library/tkinter.html</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which video where you watching?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the version on de video it is 3.3.3 and i usin 3.4.3, i tried if form tkinter import * tkinter.colorchooser.askcolor() and it doesn't work--&gt; NameError: name 'tkinter' is not defined</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also i realize that if I run the first one on the IDLE 3  it works . I understand all your answers but this confuses me xD.</span>
