<p>I want to get a sequence of DNA as a string and i need to split the string into parts of a list.And each part must contain same characters only.And final output must be a list according to the order of the original sequence using python 3.4</p>
<p>Ex:-  <code>infected ="AATTTGCCAAA"</code>
I need to get the output as followed</p>
<pre><code>Modified.  = ['AA','TTT','G','CC','AAA' ]
</code></pre>

<pre><code>def fchar(ch,mi):

<p>It's what that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.groupby</code></a> is for :</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import groupby
&gt;&gt;&gt; infected ="AATTTGCCAAA"

&gt;&gt;&gt; [''.join(g) for _,g in groupby(infected)]

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried anything? Seems like a simple task.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry i couldn't mention that i need to implement an algorithm to do this task</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ceylon ,This is my code ,, I think it will help you..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanx a lot,, actually i needed only the algorithm to implement this,, so code means a lot</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CeylonSpace , You Are welcome !!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">good solution +1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanx sir .It is also working..I need to know  whether groupby is a built in package in python.?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ThilinaChathuranga Welcome, <code>group</code> by is not a built in function  your need to import it from <code>itertools</code> module which is one of python default modules.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kasramvd : thanx a lot,, it seems easy. But actually i need to make an algorithm and implement what i need.because it is a pastpaper question which asked for the algorithm.So i can't  import and use predefined functions.Anyway thanx</span>
