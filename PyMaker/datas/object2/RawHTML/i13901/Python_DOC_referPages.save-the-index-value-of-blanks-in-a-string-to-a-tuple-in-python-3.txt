<p>How can I save the index position of spaces in a text sentence to a tuple  so I can reconvert the sentence back after removing the strings?</p>
<p>For example in this text the are spaces which causes an error as there are no space in the ascii alphabet. So I want to remove the spaces, convert and then reformat spaces back to original position.</p>
<pre><code>import string

text = "This is the text I wish to convert"

alpha = [c for c in list(string.ascii_lowercase)]
alphaTup = tuple(alpha)

myConvert = list(text.lower())

blanks = myConvert.index(' ')
print(blanks)
# This doesn't work
for item in myConvert:
    #find index of item in alphaTup and return value at index + 1
    newLet = alphaTup[alphaTup.index(item) + 1]
    print(newLet)
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to know the indices of all the blanks, I suppose using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow"><code>enumerate</code></a> could be helpful:</p>
<pre><code>blank_indices = [i for i, c in enumerate(text) if c == ' ']
</code></pre>
<p>(This gives a <code>list</code> instead of a <code>tuple</code>, but it's not hard to get the <code>tuple</code> if you really need it...)</p>
<p>With that said, looping over a string character-by-character, is not the best way to accomplish <em>most</em> tasks in python.  It's hard for me to tell exactly what transform you're trying to perform on the string, so I'm not sure how to advise better ...</p>

<span class="comment-copy">can you give us an example about what you are trying to achieve?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">space is certainly a valid letter in the standard ascii alphabet ... so not sure what you mean</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ozgur          Just doing a cipher transform, so take the sentence and convert each word to consist of the next letter in the alphabet. So the word 'this' would be 'uijt'</span>
