<p>At the moment I'm using python on a Raspberry. My goal is that the picture, that the raspberry takes from a PiCamera should be save on the desktop with different names. 
Example : 
It take a photo and safe it as image1. The Next image should be safe as image2 (without using a loop that takes 5 photos in a row.</p>
<p>Here is my Code that I use at the moment : </p>
<pre><code>import time                                                             
from picamera import PiCamera                                           


cam = PiCamera()                                                         
fname = (time.strftime("%Y-%b-%d_%H:%M:%S"))                            

cam.resolution = (1920, 1080)                                           
cam.framerate = 30                                                  

cam.capture('/home/pi/Desktop/image' + str(fname) +'.jpg')      
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming that <code>image1.jpg</code>, <code>image2.jpg</code>, <code>image3.jpg</code> and so on, are created exactly in this order you could get name of newest (i.e. having greatest number) following way:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.chdir('/home/pi/Desktop/image')
images = [i for i in os.listdir(os.getcwd()) if i.lower().startswith('image')]
if images:
    newest = max(images,key=os.path.getmtime)
else:
    newest = 'image0.jpg'
</code></pre>
<p>If there is not image at all, I set <code>newest</code> to <code>image0.jpg</code> string (however I do not create such file). Then we need to extract number from that name, it can be done for example following way:</p>
<pre><code>number = int(''.join([i for i in newest if i.isdigit()]))
</code></pre>
<p>Above line assumes that all <code>image</code> names are correct and follows pattern: <code>image_.jpg</code> where <code>_</code> is number. Finally we could create name for new image:</p>
<pre><code>newimagen = 'image'+str(number+1)+'.jpg'
</code></pre>
<p>Now you could use it in your <code>capture</code> method argument:</p>
<pre><code>'/home/pi/Desktop/'+newimagen
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What's not working with this code? It will save a unique picture given the current time stamp? is that not enough? Except you should ditch the extra parenthesizes around <code>time.strftime()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't want that the picture called like the current time but with numbers. Due to my goal, it should save pictures from 1 object from different sides</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much. It works.</span>
