<p>I am writing a program to calculate the mass of a given molecule. I have defined every element as an integer. I need to be able to type in a chemical formula like NaCl and have it print out the sum of the atomic masses of Na and Cl. So far I have things set up so that I can type in a chemical formula and it turns it into a list of elements, so if I typed in NaCl it would give me ['Na', 'Cl']. Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>import re
Na = 22.99
Cl = 35.45
input = raw_input()
inputList = (re.findall('[A-Z][^A-Z]*', input))
</code></pre>
<p>Firstly I need to know how to tell the computer I am inputting variables that I previously defined, not strings. Then I want to make it assign each item from the list to its own variable. Something like</p>
<pre><code>e1 = Na
e2 = Cl
</code></pre>
<p>My main issue is that at the moment my input is treated as a string. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I believe what you want is a dictionary, like so:</p>
<pre><code>atomic_wt = {'Na':22.99, 'Cl':35.45}
</code></pre>
<p>Later, when you have your inputs, you can access them in a loop:</p>
<pre><code>for element in inputList:
    elem_wt = atomic_wt[element]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow"><code>sum()</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow"><code>map()</code></a> functions to add up the appropriate values from a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; elements = {'Na':22.99, 'Cl':35.45}
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = ['Na', 'Cl']
&gt;&gt;&gt; answer = sum(map(elements.get, result))
&gt;&gt;&gt; answer
58.44
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using a dictionary, you can easily take string input and handle it:</p>
<pre><code>elements = { 'Na': 22.99,
             'Cl': 35.45
           }  # You can extend this dictionary to include more elements

print elements.get(raw_input('Enter an element symbol:   ', 'invalid'))  
"""
use the .get method to return a placeholder value, 
representing that the *input* value doesn't exist in the dictionar
"""

<span class="comment-copy">Dictionary is absolutely what you want to use here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">those are floats :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EL3PHANTEN which is why you should look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">decimal</a> if you want it to be more accurate :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JGreenwell True</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, I like this, but it returns two separate numbers. How do I get it to add these numbers?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">make a variable before the loop. Then in the loop -&gt; variable += atomic_wt[element]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EL3PHANTEN I am not quite sure what you mean.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wes1099 variable = 0, then inside the for loop, variable += atomic_wt[element]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EL3PHANTEN oh ok, I get it now. I ended up just appending elem_wt to a list before the loop restarted, then after the loop I can print the sum of that list. Now I need to figure out how to tell it to multiply the weight of an element by a number if I input something like Na2Cl...</span>
