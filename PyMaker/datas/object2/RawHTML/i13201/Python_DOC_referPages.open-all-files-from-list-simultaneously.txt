<p>I need to modify a (<em>variable</em> but small) number of files, and I wonder if there is a Python syntax that would allow me to open them in a <code>with</code> statement. E.g. something like</p>
<pre><code>file_names = ("file_a", "file_b", "file_c")

with open(file_names) as files:
    for file_ in files:
         file_.write("Hello file!")
</code></pre>
<p>The length of <code>file_names</code> in this example will vary.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Actually, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement" rel="nofollow"><code>with</code></a> does support such syntax:</p>
<pre><code>with open("file_a", "r+") as fa, open("file_b", "r+") as fb, \
        open("file_c", "r+") as fc:
    for f in (fa, fb, fc):
        f.write("Hello file!")
</code></pre>
<p>To use <code>with</code> on a variable number of context managers, you would need at least Python 3.3 and <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.ExitStack" rel="nofollow"><code>contextlib.ExitStack</code></a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just to note you're going to need to open the files with some form of write access for <code>.write</code> to work...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jon: Thanks, corrected.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Key word is variable number of files, though...</span>
