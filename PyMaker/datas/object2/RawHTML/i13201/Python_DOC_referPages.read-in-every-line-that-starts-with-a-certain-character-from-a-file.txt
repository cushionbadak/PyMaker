<p>Hi i'm just learning python and i am trying to read in every line in a file that starts with an 'X:'. I don't want to read the 'X:' itself just the rest of the line that follows.</p>
<p>This is what i've got so far:</p>
<pre><code>with open("hnr1.abc","r") as file: f = file.read()
id = []
for line in f:
    if line.startswith("X:"):
        id.append(f.line[2:])
print(id)
</code></pre>
<p>It doesn't have any errors but it doesn't print anything out.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try this:</p>
<pre><code>with open("hnr1.abc","r") as fi:
    id = []
    for ln in fi:
        if ln.startswith("X:"):
            id.append(ln[2:])
print(id)
</code></pre>
<p>dont use names like file or line</p>
<p>note the append just uses the item name not as part of the file</p>
<p>by pre-reading the file into memory the for loop was accessing the data by character not by line</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for line in f:
        search = line.split
        if search[0] = "X":
            storagearray.extend(search)
</code></pre>
<p>That should give you an array of all the lines you want, but they'll be split into separate words. Also, you'll need to have defined storagearray before we call it in the above block of code. It's an inelegant solution, as I'm a learner myself, but it should do the job!</p>
<p>edit: If you want to output the lines, simply use python's inbuilt <em>print</em> function:</p>
<pre><code>str(storagearray)    
print storagearray    
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Read every line in the file (<code>for</code> loop)<br/>
 Select lines that contains <code>X:</code><br/>
 Slice the line with index <code>0:</code> with starting char's/string as <code>X: = ln[0:]</code><br/>
 Print lines that begins with <code>X:</code> </p>
<pre><code>for ln in input_file:
    if  ln.startswith('X:'):
        X_ln = ln[0:]
        print (X_ln)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You've not stated whether your code works or what errors your have</span>
<span class="comment-copy">shouldn't it be <code>id.append(line[2:])</code>? and please don't use <b>id</b> as the name as it's a builtin function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I changed it to <code>id.append(line[2:])</code> but it doesn't change any output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also if i wanted to read the content lines that started with "T:" but only the every first and second lines that begin with T:, how might i go about that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just keep a counter as they are found - that is starting to become a state machine - and that is a much bigger discussion</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@gkusner: The name <code>line</code> is fine, but you should not use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>id</code></a> as an own variable name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this might answer the question, you should <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/55506638/edit">edit</a> your answer to include some explanation for why this solves the issue in the question. This makes it more valuable to those who come across the same issue later on.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your code doesn't work because it doesn't answer the original question. <i>i am trying to read in every line in a file that starts with an 'X:'. I don't want to read the 'X:' itself just the rest of the line that follows.</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Karel, the code will print all lines,  that starts / begins  with 'X:'  prints complete line not just 'X:'</span>
