<p>One of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html" rel="nofollow">new features</a> in python 3.5 is type hinting inspired from <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">this project</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>typing: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/" rel="nofollow">PEP 484</a> â€“ Type Hints.</p>

<p>I want to test it, but it does not work as expected.</p>
<pre><code>import typing

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance: int = 0) -&gt; None:
        self.balance = initial_balance
    def deposit(self, amount: int) -&gt; None:
        self.balance += amount
    def withdraw(self, amount: int) -&gt; None:
        self.balance -= amount
    def overdrawn(self) -&gt; bool:
        return str(self.balance &lt; 0)

my_account = BankAccount(15)
my_account.withdraw(5)
print(type(my_account.overdrawn()))
</code></pre>
<p><em>results in:</em></p>
<pre><code>&lt;class 'str'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I would expect an error because I am expecting a bool as return. I tested it on python:3.5 (docker) and local. Did i miss something, to make it work? Does this typing not work at runtime (like python app.py)?</p>

<p>See the fifth paragraph of the abstract in the PEP you link to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While these annotations are available at runtime through the usual <code>__annotations__</code> attribute, <em>no type checking happens at runtime</em> . Instead, the proposal assumes the existence of a separate off-line type checker which users can run over their source code voluntarily</p>

<p>In order to get <code>static</code> checks, consider a project like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>mypy</code></a>, on which PEP 484 was based on. </p>
<p><strong>No checking will be performed on runtime</strong> is <strong><em>explicitly</em></strong> declared in the PEP to ease fears of some transition to a static looking Python. </p>
<hr/>
<p>As Daniel pointed out, you can view the attributes in the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__annotations__</code></a> attribute in a form of:</p>
<pre><code>{'return': bool}
</code></pre>
<p>for function <code>overdrawn()</code>. </p>
<p>If you want you can create your own small type checking function to perform little runtime checks utilizing this <code>dict</code>. Play around with it. Additionally, if you're up for the read, take a look at my answer on type hints <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32557920/what-are-type-hints-in-python-3-5/32558710#32558710">here</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"<i>no type checking happens at runtime.</i>" It's right in the first section.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">okay sorry thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">did not see this sorry</span>
