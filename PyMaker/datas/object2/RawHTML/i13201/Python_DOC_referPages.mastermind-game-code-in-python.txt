<p>I am creating a mastermind style game for python, so far I've modified one I found online and have fixed most of the errors but it wont run in python, for example it wont accept the <code>random.randint()</code> expression which I found online. </p>
<p>Mainly it just wants checking over and I would appreciate it if you point out any mistakes you find and maybe post some advice?</p>
<p>Here is my code: </p>
<pre><code>print("-----------------------------------MASTERMIND-----------------------------------")

colours = ['B', 'R', 'Y', 'G', 'O']

secretCode = ('BYRG')

i = 0
while i &lt; 4:
    colour = random.randint(0, 5)
    secretCode.append(colours[colour])
    i = i+1
print("Secret: "), secretCode

fullMatches = 0
guessNum = 1
while (fullMatches &lt;= 4):
    fullMatches = 0
    partialMatches = 0
    secretCodeCopy = secretCode[:]
    guess = []
    print("Guess:"),  guessNum

    i = 0
    while i &lt; len(secretCode):
        print("Enter your 4 colour guess from:")
        print(colours)
    colour = raw_input()
    guess.append(colour)
    i = i+1

    i = 0
    while i &lt; len(guess):
        if guess[i] == secretCodeCopy[i]:
            fullMatches = fullMatches + 1
            secretCodeCopy[i] = 'X'
            guess[i] = 'Y'
        i = i+1

i = 0
while i &lt; len(guess):
    j = 0
    while j &lt; len(secretCodeCopy):
        if guess[i] == secretCodeCopy[j]:
            partialMatches = partialMatches + 1
            secretCodeCopy[j] = 'X'
            guess[i] = 'Y'
        j = j+1
    i = i+1

print(fullMatches,)
print(" blacks")
print(partialMatches,)
print(" whites")
if fullMatches == 4:
    print("You guessed it in",)
    print(guessNum)
guessNum = guessNum+1

<p>You use the randint() method correctly, but you can't append a char to a string. Your first while loop for example will work if you change code as follows:</p>
<pre><code>import random

print("---------------------------------MASTERMIND-----------------------------------")

colours = ['B', 'R', 'Y', 'G', 'O']

secretCode = 'BYRG'

i = 0
while i &lt; 4:
    colour = random.randint(0, 5)
    secretCode += colours[colour]
    i = i+1
print("Secret: "), secretCode
</code></pre>

<p>There's a bunch of problems in your code:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you need to add <code>import random</code> (before the first print statement)</p></li>
<li><p>change <code>secretCode = ('BYRG')</code> to <code>secretCode = []</code></p></li>
<li><p>fix indentation</p></li>
<li><p>in the second while change <code>fullMatches &lt;= 4</code> to <code>fullMatches &lt; 4</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly this has not been written by someone very fluent in python. First thing you should learn, perhaps, is to use <code>xrange</code> to implement a for loop, instead of while loops with explicit variable initialization and increment, e.g. the first while can be written as:</p>
<pre><code>for i in xrange(0, 4):
    colour = random.randint(0, 5)
    secretCode.append(colours[colour])
</code></pre>

<p>You used the <code>random.randint()</code> correctly, but you need to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>import</code></a> the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random</code></a> module.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the code, type:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Judging by the fact that you didn't even <code>import random</code>, I'm going to guess that you're trying to make a Python app before learning Python - which, as you've found out, really doesn't work. I recommend the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official Python tutorial</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TigerhawkT3: Don't be so harch, although I agree that he should read some more, but let's help him with his random at least (which you maybe did)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's a bunch of indentation errors, might have been caused by pasting ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Judging by the parentheses with every <code>print</code>, I'd say the OP is using Python 3, which uses <code>range</code> instead of <code>xrange</code>.</span>
