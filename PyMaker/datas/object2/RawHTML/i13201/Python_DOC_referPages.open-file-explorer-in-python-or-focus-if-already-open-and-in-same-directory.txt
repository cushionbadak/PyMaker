<p>In Python I'd like to open a file explorer to a specific directory, or if it is already open in another window, bring focus to that window.  Currently I'm doing this:</p>
<pre><code>os.startfile(path, 'explore')
</code></pre>
<p>But it opens as many File Explorers as calls to <code>os.startfile</code>.  Is it possible in Python to focus on an existing one?</p>

<p>Stumbled upon this question looking for the exact opposite of what you want, to open the explorer multiple times on the same directory.</p>
<p>Coming from the documentation</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.startfile" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.startfile</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When operation is not specified or 'open', this acts like double-clicking the file in Windows Explorer, or giving the file name as an argument to the start command from the interactive command shell: the file is opened with whatever application (if any) its extension is associated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so just doing </p>
<p><code>os.startfile(path)</code> </p>
<p>or </p>
<p><code>os.startfile(path, 'open')</code> </p>
<p>would do exactly what you want as long as the opened explorer is still in the directory you started with. I don't know if I am correct though as my answer assumes you are on win7 os and using python 2.7.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You'll need to use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pywin32</code></a> to interface with the appropriate Windows subsystem to find out what Windows Explorer windows are open, if any, and what directories they're currently focused on.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The shell API offers such functionality. No need for any hacking.</span>
