<p>For my practice Controlled Assessment in Computer Science, I have to do a "Safety Quiz" in which all the questions have to be given randomly each time the quiz is started. The questions and their respective answers are below:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>What is CEOP?<br/>
  Child Exploitation and Online Protection<br/>
  Criminal Exploration and Online Protection<br/>
  Child Exploitation and Organised Protectors  </p></li>
<li><p>When you get an email from someone you do not know, what should you do?<br/>
  Delete it and mark as spam<br/>
  Reply and say hello<br/>
  Forward to your friends  </p></li>
<li><p>How secret should you keep your passwords?<br/>
  Never give out passwords except to your parents<br/>
  Give them only to your best friends<br/>
  Give them to strangers  </p></li>
<li><p>When an online contact who frightens you asks to meet you in person what should you do?<br/>
  Report to CEOP<br/>
  Arrange to meet them<br/>
  Arrange to meet them with your best friend</p></li>
<li><p>If an email asks you to enter your bank account details because of a problem with your account what should you do?<br/>
  Contact the bank to check if they sent the email<br/>
  Reply to the email<br/>
  Enter your bank account details  </p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>My first thought was put all the Questions into a list but then I realized I had no idea how to make each question appear in random order and also how to assign the answers to the questions in the list. </p>
<p>I know how hard this must be to understand but any Hints, Tips and helpful comments are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>You should combine questions and answers into one object. You could use a dictionary or a named tuple per question for example, or create custom class to model a question with appropriate answer.</p>
<p>Then put those objects into a list and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.shuffle" rel="nofollow"><code>random.shuffle()</code></a> to change the order.</p>
<p>Using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" rel="nofollow">named tuple</a> for example, would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import random
from collections import namedtuple

Question = namedtuple('Question', 'text answers')

questions = [
    Question('What is CEOP?', (
        'Child Exploitation and Online Protection',
        'Criminal Exploration and Online Protection',
        'Child Exploitation and Organised Protectors')),
    Question('When you get an email from someone you do not know, what should you do?', (
        'Delete it and mark as spam',
        'Reply and say hello',
        'Forward to your friends')),
    # ...
]

random.shuffle(questions)
for question in questions:
    print(question.text)
    for answer in question.answers:
        print(answer)
    print()
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Question()</code> object keeps a question title and the possible answers together. You could add a 3rd field that records which one of the answers is correct, so you can verify the answer picked by whomever takes the quiz.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to StackOverflow. You should really provide some code snippets that the community can solve. Otherwise there are so many ways to realize your problem. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic">this</a> for more information.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay that makes sense but could you expand on how to link the questions to the answers in a list. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dop: See the updated example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Would it be possible to make each question into a function an include each function inside the list? That way each question and answer would be contained in each function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dop: of course. Functions are just objects. That is not a common way of organising this however. Use classes and put a method on the class to do the work instead.</span>
