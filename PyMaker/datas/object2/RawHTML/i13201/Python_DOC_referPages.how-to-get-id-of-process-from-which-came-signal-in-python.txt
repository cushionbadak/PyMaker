<p>Please see following Python code:</p>
<pre><code>def Handler(signum, frame):
    #do something
signal.signal(signal.SIGCHLD, Handler)
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to get process ID from which signal came from?
Or is there another way to get process ID from which signal came from without blocking main flow of application?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>os.getpid()</code> returns the current process id. So when you send a signal, you can print it out, for example.</p>
<pre><code>import signal
import os
import time

def receive_signal(signum, stack):
    print 'Received:', signum

signal.signal(signal.SIGUSR1, receive_signal)
signal.signal(signal.SIGUSR2, receive_signal)

print 'My PID is:', os.getpid()
</code></pre>
<p>Check <a href="https://pymotw.com/2/signal/" rel="nofollow">this</a> for more info on signals.</p>
<p>To send pid to the process one may use <code>Pipe</code></p>
<pre><code>import os
from multiprocessing import Process, Pipe


def f(conn):
    conn.send([os.getpid()])
    conn.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    parent_conn, child_conn = Pipe()
    p = Process(target=f, args=(child_conn,))
    p.start()
    print parent_conn.recv()   # prints os.getpid()
    p.join()
</code></pre>

<p>You cannot directly. The signal module of Python standard library has no provision for giving access to the Posix <code>sigaction_t</code> structure. If you really need that, you will have to build a Python extension in C or C++.</p>
<p>You will find pointers for that in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html" rel="noreferrer">Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter</a> - this document should also be available in your Python distribution</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the response! But I want identify pid of process which sending signals on receiver side.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use something like <code>Pipe</code> then. I will add some code to the answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">dkol, thanks a lot!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Serge, thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems to me that this should be the accepted answer.</span>
