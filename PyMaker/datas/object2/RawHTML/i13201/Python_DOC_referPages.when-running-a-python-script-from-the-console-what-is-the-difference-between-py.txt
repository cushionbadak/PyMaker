<p>I have been reading about python, and I have certain doubts when using the shebang line. When I run:</p>
<pre><code>py file_name.py
</code></pre>
<p>It executes the script using the python version that I have indicated in the shebang line, but when I execute,</p>
<pre><code>python file_name.py
</code></pre>
<p>The last version of Python is used instead of the one that I have specified. I would like to know the difference between using <code>python</code> and <code>py</code> when running a script from the command line. My shebang line was  <code>#! python3.4</code></p>
<p>Does using either <code>python</code> or <code>py</code> have different implications or eventually both are the same?</p>

<p>"python.exe" is the actual interpreter. You have one for each version of Python on your system. Which version gets executed when you run "python" on the command line, depends on your <code>PATH</code> environment variable and your current working directory. </p>
<p>"py.exe" is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher" rel="nofollow">Python Launcher</a>. You probably only have one, even if you have multiple Python installs. Mine is in <code>C:\Windows</code>. It looks at the script, decides what version it's using, and delegates the actual execution to the proper interpreter.</p>

<p>To see what version of Python are in use for each command, run these two commands:</p>
<pre><code>python -c "import sys;print(sys.version)"
py -c "import sys;print(sys.version)"
</code></pre>
<p>If both show the same version, then on your system they are both <em>currently</em> the same. <strong>However, one or the other might be updated.</strong> I personally recommend to rely on neither, and to call the Python version that you want explicitly in your scripts.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>python scriptname.py</code> means <i>"run <code>scriptname.py</code> using the interpreter that <code>python</code> starts"</i>. I've never used <code>py</code>, but another option is to set an explicit shebang (e.g. <code>#! /usr/bin/env python3</code>) and make the script executable, then you can run it directly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have used that piece of code to check the version that is run, and that's the reason I have asked the question. When I use <code>py</code> the version that I had specified was used, but not when using <code>python</code>. I would like to know those small difference between both although at first glance both seem the same.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can also do <code>python --version</code> from the command line.</span>
