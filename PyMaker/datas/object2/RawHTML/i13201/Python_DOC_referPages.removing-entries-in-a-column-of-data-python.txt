<p>I have an excel spread sheet of data for which i am opening in python. The spreadsheet has a heading and all the data values in each column, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>Time
00:07
00:15
...
</code></pre>
<p>I have opened the file and split it into columns (each with a heading and the data below):</p>
<pre><code>for line in open ('name_of_file'):
    column = line.split(',')
    time = column[0].split(',')
    print(time[0])
</code></pre>
<p>this prints out a list such as:</p>
<pre><code>Time
00
01
02
</code></pre>
<p>I was wondering whether there is a way of removing the first entry in these printed columns?</p>

<p>You can use the <code>csv</code> module to help you along, and then skip the first line:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('name_of_file') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    next(reader) # skips the first line, the header
    for row in reader:
       print(row[0]) # The first column
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Also, you are splitting a line by <code>,</code>, then expecting that any of the resulting values will contain <code>,</code>. That's not going to happen (unless you're using <code>csv</code> to parse and a column contains quoted commas or somesuch). You'd need to provide sample input data to work with here.</span>
