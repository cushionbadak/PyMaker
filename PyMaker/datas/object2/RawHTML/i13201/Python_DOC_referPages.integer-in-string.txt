<p>Write a function named enterNewPassword. This function takes no parameters. It prompts the user to enter a password until the entered password has 8-15 characters, including at least one digit. Tell the user whenever a password fails one or both of these tests.</p>
<p>I have come up with somewhat of a solution but cannot seem to find if a digit is involved in the input. This is what I have come up with so far. </p>
<p>Can you please help me how to check if there is a digit in the password in the input? There are question marks where I feel I should put something. Thank you!</p>
<pre><code>def enterNewPassword():

    password = input("Enter a password: ")

    if len(password) &lt; 8:

        print("Your password does not contain 8-15 characters.")

    if len(password) &gt; 15:

        print("Your password contains more than 15 characters.")

    if ??? not in password:

        print("Your password does not contain a digit.")

    if ??? in password and 8 &lt;= len(password) &gt;= 15:

        print("Good password!")

enterNewPassword()

<p>If you want to check for a digit in a string you can use the any() method.</p>
<pre><code>any(c.isdigit() for c in password)
</code></pre>
<p>any will pretty much return True if the condition that is being checked returns True at least once, in this case with the "c.isdigit()"</p>
<p>The isdigit() is a method available in your string object, so you are pretty much checking each character is a digit with that call. Here is a doc on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit" rel="nofollow">isidigit</a> as well. </p>
