<p>I am having some issues importing which results in a module not found error:</p>
<p>Directory structure of project:</p>
<pre><code>- MySite
    config.py
    - MySite
          __init__.py
</code></pre>
<p>Within <strong>init</strong>.py I do the following:</p>
<pre><code>import config
</code></pre>
<p>I get an error:</p>
<pre><code>ImportError: No module named config
</code></pre>
<p>I am currently reading this book: <a href="https://exploreflask.com/configuration.html" rel="nofollow">https://exploreflask.com/configuration.html</a> which suggests a similar sort of setup.</p>
<p>Do I have to include <code>__init__.py</code> under the root directory <code>MySite</code>?</p>

<p>Per the language documentation (found here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages</a>) when you're importing a package that is in another directory like <code>- MySite</code>, depending on your Python version (3.2 or earlier) you need to include <code>__init__.py</code> in the directory itself, including the root. Also, when you import, you need to include the directory the package is in, as though they were a package themselves, like so: </p>
<pre><code>import MySite.config
</code></pre>
