<p>I am currently struggling with a question related to Python File I/O. The question I that I fail to be able to complete is this:</p>
<pre><code>Write a function stats() that takes one input argument: the
name of a text file. The function should print, on the screen, the
number of lines, words, and characters in the file; your function
should open the file only once. 
</code></pre>
<p>I must also eliminate all puncuation to properly get all of the words.The function should print like so:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;stats('example.txt')
line count: 3
word count: 20
character count: 98
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Please review the Python documentation about I/O <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, Built-in Functions <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and Common <code>string</code> operations <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are many ways to get this done. With a quick go at it, the following should get the job done based on your requirements. The <code>split</code> function will eliminate spaces when it converts each line to a <code>list</code>.</p>
<pre><code>def GetFileCounts(in_file):
    char_count = 0
    word_count = 0
    line_count = 0
    with open(in_file) as read_file:
        for line in read_file:
            line_count += 1
            char_count += len(line)
            word_count += len(line.split(' '))
    print "line count: {0}\nword count: {1}\ncharacter count: {2}".format(line_count, word_count, char_count)
</code></pre>
<p>You may want to refine your requirements defintion a bit more as there are some subtle things that can change the output:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your definition of a character?

<ul>
<li>only letters?</li>
<li>letters, spaces, in word punctuation (e.g. hyphens), end of lines, etc.?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As far as your question goes,you can achieve it by:</p>
<pre><code>fname = "inputfile.txt" 
num_lines = 0
num_words = 0
num_chars = 0 
with open(fname, 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        words = line.split() 
        num_lines += 1
        num_words += len(words)
        num_chars += len(line)
</code></pre>
<p>There are lots of free tutorial online for python. Please refer those throughly. You can find reference books <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/python/info">here</a> </p>

<p>Are you open to third party libs?</p>
<p>Have a look at: <a href="https://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/" rel="nofollow">https://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/dev/</a></p>
<p>It has all of the features you want implemented pretty well.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>@nagato , i think yout with <strong>num_chars += len(line)</strong> you come all from the file , character's and blank space , but thank for your code , i can my to do...</p>
<p>My...</p>
<pre><code>def char_freq_table():
   with open('/home/.....', 'r') as f:
   line = 0
   word = 0
   character = 0
   for i in f:
     line = len(list('f'))
     word += len(i.split()) 
     character =  i.replace(" ", "")  #lose the blank space
   print "line count: ", line
   print "word count: ", word
   print "character count: ", len(character) # length all character

char_freq_table()

<span class="comment-copy">What did you have so far? Please include your code so far with your question, we are not here to do your entire assignment/homework question for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The furthest I have gotten is opening the text file in python, I just finished a 4 hour tutor session which costed a lot of money as I didn't realize the hourly rate, but the tutor was unable to help me start off at all. I have also been unable to think up any way to go about this question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you even figured out how to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>read</code></a> from the opened file object? Also have you read the documentation on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str</code></a> type and methods it has such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>splitlines</code></a>? Since you are counting things you might want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>len</code></a>, too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would get a new tutor.</span>
