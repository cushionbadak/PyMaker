<p>There is a <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers" rel="noreferrer">list of classifiers</a> that we can define in <code>setup.py</code> to categorize our python package in <a href="https://pypi.python.org" rel="noreferrer">PyPI</a>. Among those there are "<code>Natural Language</code>" classifiers for a few languages. When should those classifiers be included in a project's setup.py? Is it for packages related to Natural Language Processing or they should be used when the package's source code is written in a corresponding language?</p>

<p>Although PyPI limits the use of classifiers for those in its list, there is no explanation on how to use each classifier on the list. <a href="https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PyPA's sample project</a> gives you a hint to some of them (lines 78 to 99), and also says using classifiers at all is optional!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0301/#distutils-trove-classification" rel="nofollow noreferrer">concept behind classifiers</a> is better cataloguing the packages. This is also clear <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#classifiers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. I quote and emphasize:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the list of classifiers is often used to declare what Python versions a project supports, <strong>this information is only used for searching &amp; browsing projects on PyPI</strong>, not for installing projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, it helps PyPI organize packages, so they can be found through search and browsing at PyPI's website.</p>
<p>If your package has anything to do with a natural language in the list, I strongly suggest you to include it as a classifier. It may help your package being found and better distributed.</p>
<p>By the way, classifiers <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#additional-meta-data" rel="nofollow noreferrer">should not</a> be used if your package is to be compatible with Python versions prior to 2.2.3 or 2.3.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot for taking the time to explain what is a classifier and how they are used. I'm still not sure when it should be used though. For example, if there is a python package that does spell checking for Greek, is this an appropriate case to use the "Natural Language :: Greek" classifier?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, for sure, if it helps identifying that package's functionalities. We can think the other way around: what are the inappropriate cases to use a certain classifier on a package? I think the package you described is still very appropriate for the Natural Language classifier.</span>
