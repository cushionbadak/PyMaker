<p>Let's say I have this:</p>
<pre><code>d_list = [ {'id':1, 'Name': 'Hannah', weight:150}, {'id':2, 'Name':'Andrew', weight:200}, {'id':3, 'Name':'Joe', weight:180}, {'id':3, 'Name':'Joe', weight:180}]
</code></pre>
<p>How can I possibly remove say the dictionary with id 3? (so I the dictionary list will contain id 1, 2 and 4) or people that weight over 180 (so I won't have id 2 anymore)</p>
<p>I've tried everything from easy things like </p>
<pre><code>for d in d_list:
    if d['weight'] &gt; 180:
        d_list.pop(d)
</code></pre>
<p>To other things I found on google but to no avail. I'm sorry if that's been posted before or if it seems super easy but I've been looking for hours for something to help me and nothing did.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>as it is not a good idea to delete from a list you are iterating over i suggest the following list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>d_list = [item for item in d_list if item['weight'] &lt;= 180]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>pop() for arrays takes an integer as an argument, not an object. Use </p>
<pre><code>d_list.remove(d)
</code></pre>
<p>instead.</p>

delete d_list[index]

<span class="comment-copy">Hi,thanks for the suggestion, I've actually tried that code in my main program and it did nothing. Not sure what I did wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">did you assign the list comprehension to <code>d_list</code>? or did you use it inside a function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and by the way: your code is not correct python (unless you assiged <code>weight</code> to someting): you need to use <code>'weight'</code> as a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh yea, my bad, I wrote that example purely random, truth is my program is somewhat more complex. I have a function that takes the parameters the dictionary list and the value I want to compare other key's values with so I know what to delete  Also, fun thing, if I use .remove it will always skip 1 element in between, say I want to remove first 8 dictionaries, 2, 4, 6 and 8 won't get removed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">'2, 4, 6 and 8 won't get removed': that's what happens if you modify a list as you are iterating over it...</span>
