<p>I want to use indentations for code control, and have two questions.</p>
<p>1) Is it possible to force python ignore 'unexpected indent' errors?
Code like this raises 'unexpected indent' exception.</p>
<pre><code>def test():
    print ('hello')
        print ('again!')
</code></pre>
<p>Is here any flag or another trick to execute above code as normal?</p>
<p>2) How I can get indention level in my program? Is something like that possible:</p>
<pre><code>import introspectionmagic
def a():
    l = introspectionmagic.get_indent_level_of_function_call ()
    print ('level =', l)
def test():
    a()
        a()
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>level = 1
level = 2
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>IndentationErrors are syntax errors; they happen at compile time, not run time. So you can't do anything in code to ignore them; you'd need to change the parser somehow.</p>
<p>You might consider using Python's context managers. These enable running specific code when entering a block; this might fit your use case, even if the actual enter code is pretty trivial. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html" rel="nofollow">contextlib</a> module for some examples.</p>
