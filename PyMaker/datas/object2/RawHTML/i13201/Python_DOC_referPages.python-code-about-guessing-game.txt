<p>I have a little problem with my code, i'm trying to make a guess game, actually it is from a book, but i can't figure out what is wrong with it...</p>

while guessesTaken &lt; 6:
    print('Take a guess..')
    guess = input()
    guess = int(guess)

    guessesTaken = guessesTaken + 1

    if guess &lt; number:
        print('Your number guess is too low, guess again')

    if guess &gt; number:
        print('Your number is too high! guess lower or something!')

    if guess == number:
        guessesTaken = str(guessesTaken)

<p>Few changes in your code tho, instead of calling <code>str</code> you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string-formatting" rel="nofollow"><code>format()</code></a></p>
<pre><code># A guess game program made in python
import random

guessesTaken = 0

print('Hello! What is your name, may i ask?')
myName = input()

number = random.randint(1, 20)
print('Well, {}, I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20'.format(myName))

while guessesTaken &lt; 6:
    print('Take a guess..')
    guess = input()
    guess = int(guess)

    guessesTaken += 1 # Instead of calling the variable itself then adding 1

    if guess &lt; number:
        print('Your number guess is too low, guess again')

    if guess &gt; number:
        print('Your number is too high! guess lower or something!')

    if guess == number:
        print('Good job, {}! You guessed the right number in {} guesses!'.format(myName,guessesTaken))

</code></pre>
<p>Also, your <code>break</code> was placed incorrectly because it will be executed before sending the <code>print</code> that you want, thus ending your code prematurely.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>number = str(number)</code> That's your issue. After that, number is a string, so you can't compare it to a number. Move the call to <code>str</code> inside the call to <code>print</code>.</span>
