<p>Hi im trying to create a program where a user input would be stored in a dictionary/class (really new to this unsure of the terminology). </p>
<p>but basically i would like to have 3 dictionaries/classes at the begining of my code which will store the information of three teams e.g. team name, then how many points the have gained over the past 3 weeks. </p>
<p>the user will then enter the next weeks points to be stored into the class/dictionary which will in turn removed the previous 3rd week. </p>
<pre><code>Premiership = {
    "Arsenal": ['points': 23,20,19],
    "Chelsea": ['points': 15,14,11],
    "Man utd": ['points' : 20, 17, 14],
}

Championship = {
    "Derby county": ['points': 23,20,19],
    "QPR": ['points': 15,14,11],
    "Leeds Utd": ['points' : 20, 17, 14],
}

League one = {
    "Sheffield utd": ['points': 23,20,19],
    "Barnsley": ['points': 15,14,11],
    "Bradford city": ['points' : 20, 17, 14],
}
</code></pre>
<p>so they would select the league by:</p>
<pre><code>selection = raw_input('please choose a league: ')
</code></pre>
<p>then once they have done that i want to allow the user to update the score and get rid of one</p>

<p>Your syntax is a bit off on how the dictionaries are built.  You Sub contain an invalid syntax list and should look closer to:</p>
<pre><code>Premiership = {
    "Arsenal": {'points': [23,20,19]},
    "Chelsea": {'points': [15,14,11]},
    "Man utd": {'points' : [20, 17, 14]},
}
</code></pre>
<p>A better way may be to change your formatting a slight bit, as with the current scenario the "points" field isn't providing any benifit</p>
<pre><code>Premiership = {
    "Arsenal": [23,20,19],
    "Chelsea": [15,14,11],
    "Man utd": [20, 17, 14],
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can than access the content in the Premiership dictionary as follows</p>
<pre><code>Premiership["Arsenal"][0] = &lt;&lt;new value&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You will than need to figure out your logic in how you rotate your list values</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Not sure what is the actual problem.. Anyway, looks like you should take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorials</a>.</span>
