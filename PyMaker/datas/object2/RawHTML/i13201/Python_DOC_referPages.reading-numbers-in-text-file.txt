<p>I am a beginner in python learning how to read and manipulate data in text files. </p>
<p>Lets say I have a text file <em>grades.txt</em> :</p>
<pre><code>.25 45 67 89
.75 23 45
</code></pre>
<p>I want to create a program that averages the grades for each line and multiplies that by the weight which is always the first number in each line. </p>
<p>It then should add the weighted total for all of the lines and print a the final grade. </p>
<p>How would I do this if I didn't know the number of grades in a text file or if I had different weights? </p>
<p>Currently I can only do it if I already know how many grades there are going to be.</p>
<p>Code so far:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    file = open("grades.txt", "r")
    for line in file:
        weight, gradeOne, gradeTwo, gradeThree = line.split()
        grade = (int(gradeOne) + int(gradeTwo) + int(gradeThree)/3

        print(float(weight) * grade)

main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>line.split(' ')</code> to return a list of grades where the weight is <code>list[0]</code>. </p>
<p>Then you can get rid of the weight, and cycle through the list in a for loop. </p>
<p>You add all the grades, then divide by the length of the list of grades.<br/>
Don't accidentally include the weight!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>After splitting the string, use <code>map()</code> to turn each item into a <code>float</code>. Use <code>*</code> unpacking to assign the first item to <code>weight</code>, and the rest to a <code>list</code> called <code>grades</code>.</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    file = open("grades.txt", "r")
    for line in file:
        weight, *grades = map(float, line.split())
        print(weight * sum(grades)/len(grades))

main()
</code></pre>
<p>You can then use handy functions like <code>sum()</code> and <code>len()</code> to find the average. <code>map()</code>, <code>float()</code>, <code>sum()</code>, and <code>len()</code> are all <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">Python built-in functions</a>.</p>

<p>This will work in Python 2.7 as well as 3.x.</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    total_grade = 0
    with open('grades.txt', 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            split = line.split(' ')
            grades = map(int, split[1:])
            line_grade = (sum(grades) / len(grades)) * float(split[0])
            print line_grade
            total_grade += line_grade
    print total_grade

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
