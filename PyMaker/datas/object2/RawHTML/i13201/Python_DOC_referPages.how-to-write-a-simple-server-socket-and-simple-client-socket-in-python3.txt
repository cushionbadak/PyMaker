<p>The title basically says it all. I want the absolute, most barebones, simplest implementation of a server socket, and a client socket. Im sure there are questions similar to this, but I have not found anything that works for me.  If possible, please have the server socket send the message "hi" to the client socket which receives this and prints it out. Vice-versa would also be nice just so I can see a client sending to a server and how it works. Thanks! </p>

<p>The documentation has pretty much what you're asking for: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#example" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#example</a></p>

<p>besides <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" rel="nofollow">Doc of Python</a>, <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_networking.htm" rel="nofollow">tutorialspoint</a> is also a good place to start learning</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why was this post downvoted? This is well within the field of allowed questions of the site. Its specific, its too the point. Yes, it does have alot of room for use interpretation and variation is programming method but the end goal is specifically defined and a nonspecific procedure is as well. For the person who downvoted my post, and the two answers, I'd like to understand why. Thanks...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh, thats what I was looking for. I checked the documentation earlier however and I couldn't find it. I guess I need to start looking harder... Thanks so much, sorry I should have found that on my own.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! That also helps, again, I should have found this on my own. I used tutorialspoint a bit for when I was learning java. I really need to work on my research skills. Next time I'll google more before I ask questions here!</span>
