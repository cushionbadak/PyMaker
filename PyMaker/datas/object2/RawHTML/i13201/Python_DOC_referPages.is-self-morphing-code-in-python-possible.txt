<p>The following code is written in the morph.py file:</p>
<pre><code>with open("morph.py", "r+") as f:
     old = f.read() # read everything in the file
     f.seek(0,2) # rewind
     f.write("1") # write the new line before
a="BAD"
a1="Worked"
print a
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that the morph.py file will be rewritten, and the text "Worked" will be printed. </p>
<p>This is not the case, I think it has to do with how Python interpreter loads the files. The only thing that makes sense is that the whole file is loaded, and then run.</p>
<p>Can somebody shed some light? Is it even possible to have self morphing code in python?</p>

<p>Not in the way you're trying to do it.</p>
<p>Before Python starts executing any piece of code, it compiles it into a bytecode representation, which is much faster to execute than reading line-by-line. This means that after Python has compiled the file, no changes to the file will be reflected in currently-running code.</p>
<p>However, you can manually load code from strings by using <code>compile</code>, <code>exec</code>, or <code>eval</code>. You can use this to create a program that is passed its own source code, alters and returns it, and executes the modified source code.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When I run the file the first time it outputs:</p>
<pre><code>BAD
</code></pre>
<p>When I run it a second time it outputs:</p>
<pre><code>Worked
</code></pre>
<p>Any subsequent times it will give an error:</p>
<pre><code>... name 'a11' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>When you run python on a file, it will load the file, then convert it to bytecode, then execute the bytecode. The file has already undergone conversion when you change the file, so you see no effect.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I voted to close a simple typographic error: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.lseek" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.SEEK_SET == 0</code></a>, not <code>2</code>. Just use the predefined constants instead of a magic number. (See also: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/imp.html#imp.reload" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>imp.reload</code></a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The seek function is doing what I expect it to do. If I run the code the second time, it outputs "Worked". How does Python run the files? Does it load the whole file in memory? It seems a bit nonsensical since there might be a bunch of if statements that will never be ran.</span>
