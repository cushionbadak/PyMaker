<p>I'm trying to convert my Python 2 script to Python 3. How do we do Regex with Unicode?</p>
<p>This is what I had in Python 2 which works It replaces quotes to « and »:</p>
<p><code>text = re.sub(ur'"(.*?)"', ur'«\1»', text)</code></p>
<p>I have some really complex ones which the "ur" made it so easy. But it doesn't work in Python 3:</p>
<p><code>text = re.sub(ur'ه\sایم([\]\.،\:»\)\s])', ur'ه\u200cایم\1', text)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>All strings in Python3 are unicode by default. Just remove the <code>u</code> and you should be fine. </p>
<p>In Python2 strings are lists of bytes by default, so we use <code>u</code> to mark them as unicode strings. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<p>Since Python 3.0, the language features a str type that contain
  Unicode characters, meaning any string created using "unicode rocks!",
  'unicode rocks!', or the triple-quoted string syntax is stored as
  Unicode.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Unicode HOWTO</a> This doc will help you.</p>
<p>so, you just do want every you do in Python2, and it will works, no extra effects.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You do not need <code>u</code> in Python 3 as all strings are Unicode by default. Omit the <code>u</code> prefixes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Klaus D. IMO not a duplicate. Referenced question is for python 2.x</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. Removing <code>u</code> fixed the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What about if you're writing code that is supposed to work in both Python 2 and 3?</span>
