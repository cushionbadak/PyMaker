<p>I was wondering if it is possible to write a script to remote into numerous servers to install FTP and then configure the setting? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance!  </p>

<p>One pretty simple way of doing this would be to use ansible (python) <a href="https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-vsftpd" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-vsftpd</a> that said ansible support for windows is a bit iffy. </p>
<p>Or maybe you could just use Python standard FTP lib to do what you need (it's already part of Python install)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">definitely powershell, much simpler, if you are talking about windows, also you might consider using configuration management tools, like DSC, ansible, etc</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python has <a href="http://www.fabfile.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Fabric</a> to run commands on many servers (using SSH)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, it's possible. Or were you looking for someone to point you at/give you an already-written script?</span>
