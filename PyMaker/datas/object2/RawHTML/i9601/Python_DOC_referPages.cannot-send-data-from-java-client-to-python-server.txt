<p>I'm using <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17440933/5460216">this method</a> to send data from a Java client and receiving it on a python server. The data sent is a simple string of length 10 but I'm not able to receive it on server side. It shows a blank output for received data even when the connection is established properly. I've checked <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33654514/communication-javaclient-with-pythonserver">this</a> question and so I've reprogrammed my server to first receive 2 bytes and then receive the string but it's not working. Can anyone explain? I've put some comments to explain the output.</p>

<p>Server.py</p>

<pre><code>import socket
import time

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
print "Socket Created..."
s.bind((str(socket.INADDR_ANY), 2609))
print "Socket bound to INADDR_ANY with port 2609..."
s.listen(5)
print "Socket listening for connections..."
print "Waiting for client to connect..."
(c, remote_addr) = s.accept()

print "Connection From" + str(remote_addr) + " accepted"
rec = 'pppppppppppppppppp'

print 'rec = ' + rec               #Properly prints the initialized string
print 'lenght is ' + str(len(rec)) #prints length = 18
print "Receiving Data..."
leng = c.recv(2)
print "Data received..."
print leng                         #Does not print Anything

rec = c.recv(1024)

print rec                          #Does not print Anything

print 'lenght is ' + str(len(str(rec)))  #Length is 0
c.close()
print "Client socket closed..."
s.close()
print "Server Socket closed..."

<p>As the rest of your code on the sende side is unknown, I cannot identify the problem for sure, but there may be two possible reasons I can imagine:</p>
<h2>Sender side</h2>
<p>You use the code as stated in your <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17440795/send-a-string-instead-of-byte-through-socket-in-java/17440933#17440933">link</a>. If you do not receive anything, this may indicate that the <code>OutputStream</code> is bufferedand nothing is send, <strong>yet</strong>, although you called <code>write(...)</code>. Try to <code>flush()</code> it and see if you receive something.</p>
<h2>Receiver side</h2>
<p>In Python 3 <code>recv</code> returns a bytes object as stated in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.recv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The return value is a bytes object representing the data received.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Python 2, you get a string, as stated in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html#module-socket" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The return value is a string representing the data received.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, as you send your strings from a Java client, which encodes in <code>UTF-8</code>, you should decode the bytes or string again at the receiver side with <code>data.decode('utf-8')</code> to get a Unicode string.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Which version of Python do you use?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@thatguy : python 2.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The idea of flushing worked. You saved my day!!!! :D</span>
