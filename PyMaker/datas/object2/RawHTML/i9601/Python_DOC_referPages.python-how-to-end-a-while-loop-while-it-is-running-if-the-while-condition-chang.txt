<p>I need some help with code in a text based game I am trying to make. My game uses health, and the code starts off with "while health&gt;0:", and in another point in the game, when health eventually =0, the loop still continues. How do I make the loop end when health=0, without finishing the whole loop. </p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>health=100
while health&gt;0:
  print("You got attacked")
  health=0
  print("test")
</code></pre>
<p>Should the code not be stopping when health=0, and not print "test"? How to I get it to stop when health=0? The code I wrote deducts health based on  the users actions, so the times when health=0 can vary. I want to end the code whenever health=0 Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>The condition is only evaluated at the start of <em>each iteration</em>. It does not get checked <em>in the middle of an iteration</em> (e.g. as soon as you set to <code>health</code> to zero).</p>
<p>To explicitly exit the loop, use <code>break</code>:</p>
<pre><code>while health&gt;0:
  ...
  if some_condition:
    break
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>break</code> statement, like in C, breaks out of the smallest enclosing <code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loop.

<p>You should use 'break' statement to come out of the loop</p>
<pre><code>health=100
while health&gt;0:
  print("You got attacked")
  # decrement the variable according to your requirement inside the loop
  health=health-1 
  if health==0:
    break
  print("test")
</code></pre>

<h1>Cleaner implementation</h1>
<pre><code>health = 100
while True:
    if (health &lt;= 0): break
    print ("You got attacked!")
    health = 0
    print ("Testing!")
</code></pre>
<p>Outputs:</p>
<pre><code>You got attacked!
Testing!
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The <code>health&gt;0</code> check only happens at the beginning of each iteration, so <code>health=0</code> won't take into affect until after <code>print('test')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. Throughout my code i will keep deducting health based on the users actions(their input), and i want to to end whenever health=0, which can change based on what decisions the user makes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should know whenever a user's health will change, simply add an <code>if health=0 : break </code> statement after each time the user's health changes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I thought of doing that, but i though there would be a more efficient way to do it. Ill do that anyway it shouldnt be a problem. Thank you!</span>
