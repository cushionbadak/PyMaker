<p>I read that <code>sys.maxsize</code> is the largest value Python 3's int can hold.
However, it seems not to be the case; I can put much bigger number and it still does not overflow.</p>
<p>What is the limit that <code>int</code> can hold in Python 3? I am asking because I am converting a string to an integer and I am wondering if I need to worry about a possibility of overflow when doing the conversion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sys.maxint constant was removed, since there is no longer a limit
  to the value of integers. However, sys.maxsize can be used as an
  integer larger than any practical list or string index. It conforms to
  the implementation’s “natural” integer size and is typically the same
  as sys.maxint in previous releases on the same platform (assuming the
  same build options).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Depends on how much memory is available to the Python interpreter on your systems (they can be any size that free memory allows).</span>
