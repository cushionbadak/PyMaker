<p>This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>my_dict = {'Anthony Hopkins': ' Hannibal, The Edge, Meet Joe Black, Proof', 'Julia Roberts': ' Pretty Woman, Oceans Eleven, Runaway Bride', 'Salma Hayek': ' Desperado, Wild Wild West', 'Gwyneth Paltrow': ' Shakespeare in Love, Bounce, Proof', 'Meg Ryan': ' You have got mail, Sleepless in Seattle', 'Russell Crowe': ' Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man, American Gangster' .....}

dictrev={}

for i in mydict:
    for j in mydict[i] :
        if j not in dictrev:
           dictrev.setdefault(j, []).append(i)
print (dictrev)
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that when I debug I saw that the program reads only one character values (this line <code>for j in mydict[i] :</code> and I need the first value (there are multiple values).</p>
<p>Any suggestions what is the problem
Thank you very much for your help</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Could you please format your code like this:</p>
<pre><code>do whatever
</code></pre>
<p>You do that by typing enter two times, then for each line of code indenting four spaces. To type normally after that, start a new line and do not type the four spaces at the start of it.</p>
<p>If I understand what you are asking, you want to swap the key and value of the dictionary, and you are getting an error while doing so. I cannot read your unformatted code (no offense), so I will provide a dictionary swapping technique that works for me.</p>
<pre><code>my_dict = {1: "bob", 2: "bill", 3: "rob"}
new_dict = {}

for key in my_dict:
    new_key = my_dict[key]
    new_value = key
    new_dict.update({new_key:new_value})

print(new_dict)
</code></pre>
<p>This code works by having the original dictionary, <code>my_dict</code> and the uncompleted reversed dictionary, <code>new_dict</code>. It iterates through <code>my_dict</code>, which only provides the key, and using that key, it finds the value. The value that we want to be a key is assigned to <code>new_key</code> and the key that we want to be a value is assigned to <code>new_value</code>. It then updates the reversed dictionary with the new key/value. The final line prints the new, reversed dictionary. If you want to set <code>my_dict</code> to the reversed dict, use <code>my_dict = new_dict</code>. I hope this answers your question.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As has been pointed out in the comments, the values in your <code>dict</code> are strings, thus iterating over them will produce single characters. Split them into the desired tokens and it will work:</p>
<pre><code>dictrev={}  # movie: actors-list  (I assume)

for k in mydict:
    for v in mydict[k].split(', '):  # iterate through the comma-separated titles
        dictrev.setdefault(v, []).append(k)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If what you want is the reverse your dictionary values (separated by commas), the following may be the solution that you're looking for:</p>
<pre><code>my_dict = {
    'Anthony Hopkins': ' Hannibal, The Edge, Meet Joe Black, Proof',
    'Julia Roberts' : ' Pretty Woman, Oceans Eleven, Runaway Bride'
}
res_dict {}

for item in my_dict:
    res_dict[item] = ', '.join(reversed(my_dict[item].strip().split(','))).strip()
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>strip()</code></a> used to remove spaces at the beginning / end of each value</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>split()</code></a> used to split values (using <code>,</code> separator)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your question isn't very clear - please provide examples of what your output is and exactly what you expected</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>for j in mydict[i]</code> will iterate over whatever value is associated with the key <code>i</code>. If this value is a string, it will iterate over it one character at a time. What do you want it to do? Also, you will probably have a problem with <code>newdict.setdefault(v, []).append(k)</code> because you don't declare <code>k</code> or <code>v</code> in the code you show. Please show all relevant code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Provide an example of <code>mydict</code>, <code>dictrev</code>, as well as your expected output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's your <code>mydict</code> content?</span>
