<p>I am trying to install multiprocessing in my conda environment. From anaconda's website: <a href="https://anaconda.org/auto/multiprocessing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://anaconda.org/auto/multiprocessing</a>, to install multiprocessing I ran in my conda env:</p>
<pre><code>conda install -c auto multiprocessing=2.6.2.1
</code></pre>
<p>However, I got this error:</p>
<pre><code>UnsatisfiableError: The following specifications were found to be in conflict:
  - multiprocessing 2.6.2.1*
  - python 3.5*
</code></pre>
<p>Why is this so? Is multiprocessing not compatible with <code>python 3.5</code>? If so, is there a way to install a specific version of multiprocessing in conda environment that is compatible with python 3?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://anaconda.org/auto/multiprocessing/files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://anaconda.org/auto/multiprocessing/files</a> , <em>that version of</em> <code>multiprocessing</code> was indeed not written to be compatible with Python 3.</p>
<p>The fact that its page links to Google Code also means that it's long abandoned since that site has closed down a few years ago, and it's luck that even the archive is still there.</p>
<p>Speaking of which:</p>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-multiprocessing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-multiprocessing/</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a back port of the multiprocessing package introduced via
  PEP-371 and Python 2.6. This is essentially for meta-fork of the
  original pyprocessing project found at:
  <a href="http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it's functionally equivalent to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>multiprocessing</code> in the standard library</a> introduced in Python 2.6, and you should use that.</p>
<p>The <code>conda info</code> for it says the same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Summary: Backport of the multiprocessing package to Python 2.4 and 2.5</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><i>"Is multiprocessing not compatible with python 3.5?"</i> - "The following specifications were found to be in conflict" is saying just that.</span>
