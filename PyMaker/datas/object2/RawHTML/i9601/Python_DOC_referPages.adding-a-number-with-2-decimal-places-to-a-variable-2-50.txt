<p>There are two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>You loose the decimal places as soon as you convert it to an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>int</code></a> in <code>int(current)</code>.</li>
<li>If you always want two decimal places you have to use some sort of string formatting.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would advise just to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.format</code></a> with "2" decimal places (here enforced by the <code>.2f</code>):</p>
<pre><code>'Your current total cost is £ {:.2f} '.format(current)
</code></pre>
<p>If you're working with "money"-like variables you should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>decimal.Decimal</code></a> instead of floats, just so you don't need to take care of the "inexactness" of floating point numbers.</p>

<p>You are converting your float current bill amount to int in this line</p>
<pre><code>print("Your current total cost is " + "£" + str(int(current)))

<p>Instead use this command to print your current bill amount.</p>
<pre><code>print("Your current total cost is " + "£" + "{0:.2f}".format(round(current,2)))

<p>output</p>
<pre><code>Your current total cost is £5.50

<p><code>int</code> turns a number into a whole number. For example,<code>int(2.1) = 2</code> </p>
<p>Your last line should have just <code>str(current)</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">remove int(current) and use str(current) directly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well just remove the int()</span>
