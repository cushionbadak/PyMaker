<p>I was able to print in a file with python.
I have a dictionary with this form:</p>
<pre><code>dict['name']=x
dict['list']="\n".join(mylist)
</code></pre>
<p>When I print on file I don't have a single row but I have the same number as number of "\n".</p>
<p>How can I have a file of this form:</p>
<pre><code>name1 item1
      item2
      item3
name2 item1
      item2
name3 item1
      item2
</code></pre>
<p>...</p>
<p>Thanks for answers</p>
<p>Edit with that code I have this:</p>
<pre><code>name1 item1
item2
item3
name2 item1
item2
name3 item1
item2
</code></pre>
<p>Intead I want the same that I have when in excel I press ALT + ENTER</p>
<p>Edit2:</p>
<p>If I have a CSV file I want this:</p>
<pre><code>CELL A:1 with name1
CELL B:1 with item1\nitem2\nitem3
CELL A:2 with name2
CELL B:2 with item\nitem2
...
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming a dictionary mapping strings to lists. </p>
<pre><code>d = {'a': [1,2,3], 'b': [1,2,3]}

for k in d:
    name = k
    for item in d[k]:
        print('{:&lt;5} {:&lt;5}'.format(name, item))
        name = ''
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>a     1
      2
      3
b     1
      2
      3
</code></pre>
<p>To print to a file with this, we'll open the file and then print to it using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print</code></a></p>
<pre><code>with open('filename.txt', 'w+') as f:
    for k in d:
        name = k
        for item in d[k]:
            print('{:&lt;5} {:&lt;5}'.format(name, item), file=f)
            name = ''
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>'{:&lt;5} {:&lt;5}'</code> is a basic use of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#formatspec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">format specification mini-language</a>.  All it's really saying is "I want the two arguments to <code>format</code> to be formatted to width five, left aligned and separated by a space".  I suggest you look around online for examples of <code>format</code>, it can be very powerful when you know how to use it.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Oh, I didn't see that you were working with a <code>csv</code> file.  You need to use quote characters so the file knows that the newlines are not the start of new rows</p>
<pre><code>import csv

d = {'a': [1,2,3], 'b': [1,2,3]}

with open('filename.csv', 'w+', newline='') as f:
    w = csv.writer(f, quotechar='"')
    for k in d:
        name = k
        item = '\n'.join(i for i in d[k])
        w.writerow([str(k), item])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you show us your write statement to the file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">dict['list']=" ".join(mylist). Or do you need the /n as your question title suggests?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that is a nice edit to show what you want. When you add what @sudobangbang asks for, please also add what it does now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JeremyKahan I don't want the list separated by space. I want the same in excel when I press ALT+ENTER. Is it possible?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now I will try. Can you explain me?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@all_key_the I'd be happy to explain.  Which part don't you understand?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It isn't what I want. This doen't work in a file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand the part of  {:&lt;5} {:&lt;5}. Unfortunely I started with python 3 weeks ago</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What version of python are you on?  if you're using python 3, you can print to a file from the <code>print</code> function</span>
