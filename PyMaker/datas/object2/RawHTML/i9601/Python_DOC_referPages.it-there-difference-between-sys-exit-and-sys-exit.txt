<p>I am aware of some facts about <code>sys.exit()</code>. However, I have seen some usage of <code>sys.exit(_("some error msg blablabla"))</code>, is there any differences between them?</p>

<p>One would be use to exit out and display a message on the console, so if you are for example running a game and let's say you have a menu:</p>
<p>Option 1 - Play
Option 2 - Options
Option 3 - Exit </p>
<p>If the user selects option 3 you could then call sys.exit() but what if you wanted to show a nice message to engage them say sys.exit('Thank you for playing I hope you come back soon') basically that will be displayed after the player selects option 3.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><i>Where</i> have you seen that? Is in in something using <code>_</code> for i18n (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/5893946/3001761">stackoverflow.com/a/5893946/3001761</a>, #2)? Have you read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have read the official doc, the stackoverflow post is useful, thx.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you pass a string (or anything other than an <code>int</code> or <code>None</code>), then <code>sys.exit</code> will set the system exit status to 1 (failure).  So you wouldn't use it to show “a nice message”, but you could use it to display an error message explaining why you're exiting the program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you pass the value of 0 which is an integer then is considered “successful termination” so you can show a nice message, and yes anything other than that will be a failure.</span>
