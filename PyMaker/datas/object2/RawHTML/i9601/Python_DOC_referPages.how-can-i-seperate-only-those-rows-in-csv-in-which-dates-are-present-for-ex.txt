4) Many of us might find that example too difficult

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you need is regex, </p>
<pre><code>import re
re.search(r'\d+/\d+/\d+','The date is 11/12/98')
</code></pre>
<p>To incorporate in code you can do:</p>
<pre><code>import re
new_file  = open('/new/file.csv','w+')

for line in open('/path/to/csv'):
    if re.search(r'\d+/\d+/\d+',line):
        new_file.write(line)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As mentioned by @Jean-Fran√ßois, your file is a simple text file, it is not a csv file. To achieve the output that you want, you can try with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>regex</code></a> like below: </p>
<pre><code>import re

with open('out.txt', 'w') as out:
    with open('my_file.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            if re.search('\d+\/\d+\/\d+', line):
                out.write(line)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the content of <code>out.txt</code> is:</p>
<pre><code>1) 2/14/16, 7:19 PM - +91 9823547956: Hi all...
2) 24/14/16, 5:15 PM - +91 8026549795: have a good day
</code></pre>
<p>When using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>with statement</code></a>, you do not need to close your files explicitly (by calling <code>file.close()</code>), because it is done automatically by the end of the block.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>regex</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this isn't a csv.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A CSV file should have the same fields in every line. It's a simple table.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you don't need the parentheses, since you don't extract the group. and you should close your files after using them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, referred some other post for Regex. Copied stuff blindly, but tested.</span>
