<pre><code>from subprocess import run

<p>Is this only for python 3.5?
I'm trying on python 3.4 and it says it cant import.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That is correct. From the Python documentation<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">1</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The run() function was added in Python 3.5; if you need to retain
  compatibility with older versions, see the Older high-level API<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#call-function-trio" rel="nofollow noreferrer">2</a>

<span class="comment-copy">yes, it has been added only in 3.5. Use <code>call</code> in 3.4</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Note that it says new in 3.5 at bottom</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Here are the subprocess docs for 3.4 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3.4/library/subprocess.html</a></span>
