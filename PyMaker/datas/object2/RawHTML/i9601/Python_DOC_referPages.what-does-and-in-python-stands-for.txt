<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I try some samples in python console. And was confused for the following:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (1 and None)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (1 and None) == None
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; (1 or None) == None
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; (1 and 2) == 2
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; (2 and 1) == 2
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; (2 and 1) == 1
True
</code></pre>
<p>I was confused for what is the why (1 and None) does not return any thing is line 1? It should be None? And why (2 and 1) equals to 1 but not 2. Sorry for new with Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In python, 
empty string, dict, tuple, list are False.
The others are True</p>
<p><code>(1 and None)</code> is same as <code>if 1 is False return 1 else None</code>
that is why (1 and None) return None </p>
<p>same reason == &gt; (2 and 1) return 1 so, it's not 2.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@JRodDynamite It prints None! But why 1 and 2 will print 2, I think is should be 1 &amp; 2 which return 0....</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>1 and 2</code> is not the same as <code>1 &amp; 2</code>.</span>
