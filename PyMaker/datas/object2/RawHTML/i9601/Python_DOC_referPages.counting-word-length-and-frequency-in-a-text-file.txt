<p>I am running Python 3.4.X</p>
<p>I would like to create function which takes a string as input (where the string is the name of a file) and returns a dictionary. The dictionary should have key/value pairs where keys are integers that correspond to word lengths and the values are the number of words that appear in the file with that length. I just really have no idea how to do this and I would greatly appreciate any help with this. Thank you!</p>
<p>I want the final output to look something like this { 3:5, 4:2, 5:1, 8:1, 10:1}</p>

<p>Here is a quick example that you can try. The example assumes that the file read has a new word at each line</p>
<pre><code>def create_dict(name):
  ret = {}
  if name:
    with open(name,'r') as fd:
        for line in fd.readlines():
            line = line.replace("\n","")
            if ret.get(len(line),None) == None:
                ret[len(line)] = 1
            else:
                ret[len(line)] += 1
  return ret
</code></pre>
<p>returns <code>{8: 1, 2: 1, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 1}</code> for the following inout file data</p>
<pre><code>hello
world
from
python
to
test
scenario
</code></pre>
