<p>Apologies, I am new to Python.</p>
<p>I am trying to import a list of products from a file in this format:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>02154367, "Item 1", 1.45</p>
<p>38418495, "Item 2", 0.6</p>
<p>82530174, "Item 3", 0.95</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I need them in python in this format:</p>
<p><code>[[02154367,"Item 1",1.45],[38418495,"Item 2",0.6],[82530174,"Item 3",0.95]]</code></p>
<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can read the <code>CSV</code> files with <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pandas</a> <code>read_csv</code> function. This method creates a dataframe which is an appropriate structure for data processing. But for your desired format, you can transform it to the list of lists.</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('file.csv', header=None)
data = df.values.tolist()
print data
# [[2154367L, ' "Item 1"', 1.45], [38418495L, ' "Item 2"', 0.6], [82530174L, ' "Item 3"', 0.95]]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">csv module will do exactly that for you. Look at the documentation (except for the int/float =&gt; string bit, and integers cannot be represented with leading 0!)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure... Read the file, parse the file line by line, store the line in a list, store that list in a master list, read the next line, and repeat with a loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use the <code>csv</code> module.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is not a problem for <code>pandas</code>.  There's no reason to start whipping out the big data tools to do file I/O</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the reply, but as I'm in school I can't download other modules. Is there any way I can do this with the 'csv' module? The documentation has confused me a bit. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can check <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19838380/building-list-of-lists-from-csv-file" title="building list of lists from csv file">stackoverflow.com/questions/19838380/…</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickHaugh Perfectly fine to do that. Read this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-answer">stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-answer</a> <i>"Make sure your answer provides that – or a viable alternative."</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickHaugh There is no evidence that the problem is a toy one.</span>
