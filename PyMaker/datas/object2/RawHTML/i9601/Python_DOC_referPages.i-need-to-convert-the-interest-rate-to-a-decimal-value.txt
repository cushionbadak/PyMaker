<p>I have the following which should return a value of the interest where it should be divided by 100. How do I implement this?</p>
<pre><code>import math

p = int(raw_input("Please enter deposit amount: \n"))
r = float(raw_input("Please input interest rate: \n")) /100
t = int(raw_input("Please insert number of years of the investment: \n"))
interest = raw_input("Do you want a simple or compound interest ? \n")

B = p*(1+r)^t 

if interest == "simple":
print (float(A))
else:
print(float(B))

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try something like this (Hint you don't need to <code>import math</code> for something like this): </p>
<pre><code>from decimal import *

p = Decimal(raw_input("Please enter deposit amount:"))
r = Decimal(raw_input("Please input interest rate as a percentage:")) /100
t = int(raw_input("Please insert number of years of the investment:"))
n = 1 # You should really be asking how many times is the interest compounded per year? If the user chooses compound...

A = p*(1 + r)**t
B = p*(1 + r)**(n*t)

while(True):
  interest = raw_input("Do you want simple or compound interest?")
  if(interest.lower() == "simple"):
    print(A)
    break
  elif(interest.lower() == "compound"):
    print(B)
    break

<span class="comment-copy">Note that you should use <code>**</code> Python's exponation operator and not <code>^</code> which is bitwise XOR: <code>B = p*(1+r)**t</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What exactly are you having trouble with?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not just <code>r = float(raw_input("...")) / 100</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Side-note: <code>float</code> is a terrible type to use for monetary calculations. I <i>strongly</i> recommend <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">using <code>decimal.Decimal</code> for monetary calculations</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Duvall912: Did you also replace the use of <code>^</code> with <code>**</code> to get actual exponentiation? And can you specify what "didn't work" means? "didn't work" is possibly the least helpful statement you can make when it comes to solving a problem. <b>Edit</b>: Your update makes it clear you didn't fix the issue with <code>^</code>; <code>^</code> is bitwise-xor, not the power operator. Also, no need to convert to <code>float</code> again in the <code>print</code>s; the value is already <code>float</code>.</span>
