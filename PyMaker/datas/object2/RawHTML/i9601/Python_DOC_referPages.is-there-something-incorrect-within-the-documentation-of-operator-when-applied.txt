<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here</a> is the description of the old style string formatting, within which octal and hexadecimal values conversion are prescribed.
I've experimented with the syntax, however something unexpected occurred.</p>
<p>Code <code>'%#07x' % 1223</code> and <code>'%#07o' % 1223</code> had the similar format of results, which were <strong>'0x004c7'</strong> and <strong>'0o02307'</strong> respectively. However the associated description about octal values mismatched with the behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The alternate form causes a leading zero ('0') to be inserted between left-hand padding and the formatting of the number if the leading character of the result is not already a zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All code are executed within the Interactive interpreter of <strong>CPython</strong> with the version <strong><code>3.5.2</code></strong>. </p>
