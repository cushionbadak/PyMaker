<p>I need to redefine the following code so that any line breaks in the row data (that would show up as a blank line) show as <code>'\n'</code> in the written file.</p>
<p>However, <code>'\n'</code> needs to be written after each row to show up as a blank line.</p>
<p>Each row apparently needs to be encoded as 'utf-8' to avoid errors. </p>

<p>I'm guessing it is to do with the <code>\</code> being an escape character in Python. <code>\\</code> is interpreted to be the actual <code>\</code> string. So your code should be as follows:</p>
<pre><code>with open('csvfile.csv', 'w') as csvOutput:

    testData = csv.writer(csvOutput, delimiter='|', escapechar=' ', quoting = csv.QUOTE_NONE)


    for row in data:
        newRow = [row[x].encode('utf-8') for x in xrange(len(row))]
        testData.writerow(newRow)
        testData.writerow('\\n') #Note the final row with \\
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Try <code>testData.writerow('\\n')</code> if you want to get <code>\n</code> in the output file..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where are the linebreaks you want to escape? Are there any in the actual row content, meaning <code>row[x].replace('\n', '\\n').encode('utf-8')</code>? Or do you mean that the empty row between each row should have an escaped linebreak, meaning <code>testData.writerow(['\\n'])</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I just tried @101's suggestion for replacing line breaks in the row content which worked. Feel free to format as an answer if applicable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the response. However, this appears to keep the blank lines in the row data. In the initial comments, someone mentioned <code>'\\n'``, and row[x].replace('\n', '\\n').encode('utf-8')</code> successfully replaced the blank lines with '\n'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If the newlines is in the <i>data</i> itself, you'll have to replace those on your own with literal <code>\n</code> sequences. You can do the replacement as you generate the new rows.</span>
