<p>I am relatively new to python and have to write a code for a "Countdown" based game; the program would basically ask the user for a word, see whether it is located in a file of words, and if it <strong>isn't</strong> print (<em>directly after</em> the word input by the user) "is invalid". </p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WmrfD.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here is the portion of code relative to this (I would supply the whole thing but I'm actually in France so it's in French...)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EXtjA.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">And here is what I see on my screen now, relative to what I have been asked for.</a></p>
<p>I'm also new to this forum so apologies in advance if this post isn't as polished as others!</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance to anyone willing to help, it's greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>You could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>def wordcheck(word):
    if ...:
        return word + " is valid"

    else:
        return word + " is invalid"

print("Proposed word: {0} ".format(wordcheck(input())))
</code></pre>
<p>Where "if ..." is you checking if the word is valid</p>

<p>So, Python is a general purpose language, and just as any other language, it has nothing to do with the I/O capabilities - those are up to the ambient you are running it. </p>
<p>he built-in "input" has fixed behavior - and unless you change the terminal behavior for things like "turning  echo off", it will just proceed to the next terminal line when the user press the return key.</p>
<p>Under Windows, the usual way to get more control over the terminal is to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/msvcrt.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">msvcrt</a> library - not you'd have to build your own "input" function based on the several character-reading functions there. Actually if you are on Windows, that is likely the way your teacher wants you to follow.</p>
<p>On any other platform, the high-level way to do it is to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">curses</a> library.</p>
<p>I hope you can find your way from there.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">is it essential to have it on the same line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One could certainly argue that no it isn't! However, it's what my professors have asked for unfortunately...so yes!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and definitely in python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yep, Python 3.2.5</span>
<span class="comment-copy">wasnt aware python could do this, ill have a look for you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That might just do the trick; I'll check! Thank you!</span>

<span class="comment-copy">i just tried this, and it works but doesnt give the invalid string on the same line but on the next line which i believe isnt exactly what you were looking for</span>
