<p>In Python, how to read a file content only (not including attribute and filename), like using InputStream in Java?
I need a method that works for various file formats</p>
<p>I've tried this</p>
<pre><code>with open(filePath, "rb") as imageFile:
    str = base64.b64encode(imageFile.read())
    M=str.decode()
    print(M)
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is, I will get error for any object after that block</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The most basic way is like so:</p>
<pre><code>with open("filename.txt") as f:
    contents = f.read()
</code></pre>
<p>The variable contents will now contain a string of everything in the file. More information is in the Python Documentation (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html</a>).</p>
