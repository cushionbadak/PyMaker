<p>I'm fairly new to the language and am wondering if it's possible to see the functions that are being used in a certain Python 3 module?</p>
<p>Specifically the ones in the "ipaddress" module, thanks!</p>

<p>Generally, this type of information can be found in the languages docs.</p>
<hr/>
<p>As mentioned by John in the comments, implementations can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.5/Lib/ipaddress.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.5/Lib/ipaddress.py</a></p>

<p>In addition to getting the source code online, if you have a standard Python install it should be already sitting in an easily found location on your hard-drive. In my case it is found as a file in <code>C:\Python34\Lib</code>. Needless to say, if you go this route you need to be careful to not modify (or, even worse, delete) the file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by <i>see the functions that are being used</i>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think OP wants to see the implementation source code, which is linked from the top of the docs page you posted.  Specifically here: <a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.5/Lib/ipaddress.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.5/Lib/ipaddress.py</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, sometimes <code>inspect.getsource</code> can be helpful :-).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should consider adding the relevant parts of those links <i>directly</i> in your answer, @tehp.</span>
