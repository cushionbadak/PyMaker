<p>When using Sphinx and autodoc to document a Python project, you can use <code>:Example:</code> to include a code sample in your module/class/function docstring, which Sphinx will kindly syntax highlight for you. Something like so.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; rng = Range(0, 1000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; rng
[0, 1000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(rng)
1000
&gt;&gt;&gt; rng.start = 500
&gt;&gt;&gt; rng.start
500
&gt;&gt;&gt; rng.end
1000
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>I copied and pasted this from the Python interpreter. Is there any way to have Sphinx or autodoc execute the code and capture the output automatically for the documentation?</p>
<p>My main concern is copy-and-pasted code/output getting out-of-sync with the actual current code behavior.</p>

<p>The standard library includes <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>doctest</code></a>, which can identify, execute and verify interactive examples from text files or docstrings. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">What precisely are you trying to achieve? If you want to execute and validate that code, look into <code>doctest</code>. If not, please clarify what you <i>do</i> want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe See update. I'll have to take a look at doctest.</span>
