<p>I'm having trouble of finding a way to randomly retrieve a specific object from a list which contains multiple lists. I have tried from random import choice but I didn't manage to get "b" for example, instead I got the whole list with index 0. </p>
<p>Second question, how do I count how many "b" there are in the list l? When I use l.count it always says 0 since it counts how many "b"s there are in the list l and not the lists in the list l, as I understood it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>l = [["f","g","h","j"],["a","b","c","d"]]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import random

l = [["f","g","h","j"],["a","b","c","d"]]

random_elm = random.choice(
    random.choice(l)
)
</code></pre>
<p>From <code>choice</code> method in the standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is <code>list</code> the programming language you are using?  If not, then please tell us what tool/language for this question.</span>
