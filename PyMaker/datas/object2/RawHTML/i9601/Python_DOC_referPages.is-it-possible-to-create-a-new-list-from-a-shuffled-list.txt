<p>When I run the above, it returns as 'None'. I am trying to create a new list once it has been shuffled.</p>
<p>I want to create another list that has been created randomly and may resemble <code>["c", "a", "b"]</code></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>random.shuffle</code> is re-organizing the original list - you are only working with one list.</p>
<p>Try something like</p>
<pre><code>OriginalName = ["a", "b", "c"]
ShuffleList = list(OriginalName)  # making a new list copy

random.shuffle(ShuffleList)
</code></pre>
<p>Now you have two lists, the original and shuffled.</p>
<p>Side note: make sure to use snake case (<code>original_name</code> instead of <code>OriginalName</code>). It's Python convention.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Create the new list first, then shuffle that.</p>
<pre><code>shuffled = OriginalName[:]
random.shuffle(shuffled)
print shuffled
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.sample</code></a> for this</p>
<pre><code>import random
l = list(range(5))
print(random.sample(l, len(l)))
</code></pre>
<p>prints something like</p>
<pre><code>[4, 0, 2, 1, 3]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I want another list, that has been created randomly, and will resemble something like <code>["c", "a", "b"]</code>. Is this possible?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, <code>ShuffeList</code> is a copy of your original list, which is then shuffled in the answer.</span>
