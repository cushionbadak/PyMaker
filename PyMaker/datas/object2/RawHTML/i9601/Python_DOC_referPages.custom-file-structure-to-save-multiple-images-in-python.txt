<p>I am experimenting with packaging of data, and since most of my data is stored as image/graphs and other similar data; I was planning to find a more efficient way to store these images.</p>
<p>I did read about saving them in a DB as blob; and some others are more inclined to save them in the file system; but what I would like is to have the images to not be visible outside the application. This is essential because when I run analysis on instruments; I am not interested in showing users all the images, but only the ones related to their particular instrument.
Plus it is convenient to pack data in one single file, compared to a folder with 20-30 images in it.</p>
<p>I was thinking to store the images in a custom structure, a sort of a bin file, using python; unless there is something that already cover that functionality. In my search I didn't notice any specific struct to save images, while the most common solutions were either a folder in the file system or the DB approach.</p>

<p>If you can convert your images to raster arrays, you can store them in an HDF5 file: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29724553/add-raster-image-to-hdf5-file-using-h5py">Add raster image to HDF5 file using h5py</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">can't you use normal .zip file ? Python has standard module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zipfile</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/archiving.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">other compressions</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could perhaps use pandas and store the images in a Panel: <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Panel.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/…</a>  then just save the data structure to disk. Or you could perhaps go with a TIFF stack:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19544568/create-a-multiframe-tif-file" title="create a multiframe tif file">stackoverflow.com/questions/19544568/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Zip file may work, after all I can just extract a specific image in temp and display it in the app</span>
