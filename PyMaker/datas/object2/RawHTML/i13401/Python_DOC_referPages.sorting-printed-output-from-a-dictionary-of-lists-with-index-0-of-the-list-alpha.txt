<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a dictionary that contains the following info:</p>
<pre><code>my_dict = {
'key1' : ['f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'],
'key2' : ['b', 'a', 'e', 'f', 'k'],
'key3' : ['a', 'd', 'c' , 't', 'z'],
'key4' : ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
}
</code></pre>
<p>I want to know how can I sort the printed result in alphabetical order using the index 0 of the list. If index 0 of two lists are the same, it will consider in sorting the next index which is index 1.</p>
<p>The output should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>Officer 'a', 'b' with 'key4' ate 'c' with 'd' and 'e'.
Officer 'a', 'd' with 'key3' ate 'c' with 't' and 'z'.
Officer 'b', 'a' with 'key2' ate 'e' with 'f' and 'k'.
Officer 'f', 'g' with 'key1' ate 'h' with 'i' and 'j'.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just <em>sort the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#looping-techniques" rel="nofollow">dictionary items</a> by value</em>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import operator
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; for key, value in sorted(my_dict.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1)):
...     print("Officer '{1}', '{2}' with '{0}' ate '{3}' with '{4}' and '{5}'.".format(key, *value))
... 
Officer 'a', 'b' with 'key4' ate 'c' with 'd' and 'e'.
Officer 'a', 'd' with 'key3' ate 'c' with 't' and 'z'.
Officer 'b', 'a' with 'key2' ate 'e' with 'f' and 'k'.
Officer 'f', 'g' with 'key1' ate 'h' with 'i' and 'j'.

<span class="comment-copy">Hey alecxe! One question: Why did you use 1 inside itemgetter()?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JuandelaCruz this is because <code>items()</code> would give you tuples where the first element (with 0 index) is a key and the second (with index 1) is a value. This way we are asking <code>sorted()</code> to use the dictionary values as a sorting key.

Hope that helps.</span>
