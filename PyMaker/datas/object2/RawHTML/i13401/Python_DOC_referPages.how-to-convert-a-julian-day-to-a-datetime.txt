<p>I want to get date and time format in python from Julian day. I have an hdf file <code>t1.15008.0239.mod07.hdf</code> and I have tried to convert Julian day <code>'15008'</code> to <code>datetime</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>def julday_to_masehi(julday):
    file_date= julday
    file_date = datetime.strptime(file_date, '%y%j')
    file_date = file_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    return file_date

julday = '15232'
datetimee = julday_to_masehi(julday)
print(datetimee)
</code></pre>
<p>and the result is <code>2015-08-20</code>.</p>
<p>But I also need the time. If I try <code>julday = '150080239'</code> and change
the to code to: <code>file_date = file_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')</code>, then
I get an error.</p>
<p>So how can I convert Julian day <code>'150080239'</code> into python
<code>datetime</code> in format <code>'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>date, time = jul_date_time.split('.')
hour = int(time[:2])
minute = int(time[2:])
</code></pre>
<p>You already showed you can handle the date; this lets you construct a Python time -- and datetime -- from the pieces of the input string.</p>
<p>Is that what you need?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You might want to peruse the Python datetime documentation.  It's currently at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html</a>.  There are a lot of good manipulation methods there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25831416/4279">"julian day" may mean different things in different cases</a>. What result do you expect for <code>00232</code> and <code>100232</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read the description of <code>%H</code>, <code>%M</code> time formats</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">no, the time '0239' is julian day. oh i;m sorry i forget to show the piece of the code. i just send part of the date like this julday = '15232' and send it to funtion like this:datetimee = julday_to_masehi(julday). Of course it just return the date like '20150820'.i think  it's need to change the code of function file_date = datetime.strptime(file_date, '%y%j'), but i don't know how?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please add the missing code to your question; it's hard to read in this format.  Also, please describe how you know the time of day.  I thought that "15008" is supposed to be 2015, 08 Jan (8th day of the year).  You'll have to describe your inputs in detail if you want a proper solution.</span>
