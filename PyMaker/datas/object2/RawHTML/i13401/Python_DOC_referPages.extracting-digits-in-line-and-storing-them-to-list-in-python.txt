<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text file which produces the string " Created Form XX," where XX is an integer. I would like to extract only the integer and save that to a list to be used later in my python program.</p>
<p>Below is code for what I have been able to do so far but am not able to display the digits</p>
<pre><code>import re
with open("filename.txt") as f:
  for line in f:
    if "form" in line:
      re.findall('\d+', line)
</code></pre>
<p>How do I print the output of the last line of code and assign to a list?</p>
</div>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow"><code>re.findall</code></a> returns a list of matched values (in your case list of numbers that got matched). You should assign the list back to a variable (so that you can use it later on) - </p>
<pre><code>nums = re.findall('\d+', line)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to print this list, you can simply do -</p>
<pre><code>print(nums)
</code></pre>
<p>For if you want to print each matched element in a separate line , you can use a <code>for</code> loop or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow"><code>str.join()</code></a> -</p>
<pre><code>for i in nums:
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>You can keep a list at the top, that stores all the numbers you found the file, and extend that list with the <code>nums</code> list. Example -</p>
<pre><code>import re
numslist = []
with open("filename.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        if "form" in line:
            nums = re.findall('\d+', line)
            numslist.extend(nums)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What does <code>re.findall</code> return?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">has your line always the same format ? " Created Form XX" ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @AnandSKumar, that worked</span>
