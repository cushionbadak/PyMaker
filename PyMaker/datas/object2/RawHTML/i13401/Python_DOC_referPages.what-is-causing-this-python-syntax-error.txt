<p>I'm totally new to Python, and I'm trying to run my server but I'm getting this syntax error from the project I'm working on.</p>
<pre><code>    def find_shortest_path(start: GraphNode, end, path=[]):
                                ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>To be clear, I didn't write the code, I'm just supposed to style the project but I don't know how else to <em>see</em> the app without running it in the server.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm using...Python 2.7.10 (when I run python -V) I don't know what version the app uses?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JustusEapen can you provide more information about what app it is? I suspect if you install python3 and use that to start the django app, it will work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">installing Python 3 on my machine? I can give you more details on the app offline if you have time...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok I'm installing python3. Thanks all.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That worked! Thank you!</span>
