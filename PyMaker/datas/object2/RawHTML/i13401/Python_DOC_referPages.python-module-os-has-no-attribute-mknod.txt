<p>I want to create a new file in Python for that I am using <code>mknod</code> command, but getting error as:</p>
<pre><code>os.mknod();
AttributeError: module 'os' has no attribute 'mknod'
</code></pre>
<p>I am using windows and attributes other than <code>'mknod'</code> are working.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>os</code> offers functionality that is closely related to the OS you're using. If most other attributes can be accessed from <code>os</code> (meaning you haven't got a <code>os.py</code> file in the current dir masking the standard module) an <code>AttributeError</code> will 99% signal an unsupported function on your Operating System.</p>
<p>This is what the case is with <code>os.mknod</code> on Windows. Creating named pipes in <code>Windows</code> has, as far as I can understand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe#In_Windows" rel="nofollow">very different semantics</a>.</p>
<p>Either way, if you are trying to use <code>mknod</code> to create named pipes you'd probably be better using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.mkfifo" rel="nofollow"><code>mkfifo()</code></a> (again, only <code>Unix</code> supported) . If you're using it to create ordinary files, don't, use <code>open()</code> which is portable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Print <code>os.__file__</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">To expand vaultahs comment: You might have an own file called <code>os.py</code> which shadows the built-in package.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm - a guess - are you on Windows...?  As you're talking about <code>os</code> calls, The Operating System you're working on is essential information...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you trying to create a filesystem node without specifying a name?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">first: you must have <code>os.py</code> in your path that shadows builtin module; second: why you are using mknod for the file? use <code>open</code>; third mknod without parameters? and what is this semicolon at the end? ;)</span>
