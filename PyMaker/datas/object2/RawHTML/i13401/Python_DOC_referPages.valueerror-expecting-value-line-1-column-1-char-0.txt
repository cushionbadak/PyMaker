<p>Checked the other answers for similar problems, but couldn't find anything that solved this particular problem.  I can't figure out why I'm getting error, because I don't believe I'm missing any values.  Also, I think it's odd that it says line 1 column 1 (char 0) - any of you wonderful people have any ideas?</p>

<p>you are trying to parse the response JSON. but you didn't event sent the request.
you should send your <code>Request</code> and then parse the response JSON:</p>

<p>From what I've seen in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">both the docs</a> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">or v. 2</a>) and at the URL above, the issue is that you are trying to parse JSON which is not JSON. I suggest wrapping your call to <code>json.loads</code> in a try... except block and handle bad JSON. This is generally good practice anyway.</p>
<p>For good measure I looked up the <a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/0a1266ef1b5d/Modules/_json.c" rel="nofollow">source code for the <code>json</code> module</a>. It looks like all errors from Py2k point to value errors, thought I could not find the specific error you mention.</p>
<p>Based on my read of <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/829b49cbd2e4b1d573470da79ca844b730120f3d/Lib/json/decoder.py" rel="nofollow">the JSON module</a>, you'll also be able to get more information if you use <code>try...except</code> and print the properties of the error module as well. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you verified that the value of <code>response</code> contains JSON?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh jeez, no! Rookie mistake.  I guess that api url isn't active any longer..</span>
