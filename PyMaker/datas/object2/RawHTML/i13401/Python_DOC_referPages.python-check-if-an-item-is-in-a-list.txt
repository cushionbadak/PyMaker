<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Sorry, I'm very much a beginner to python. What I want to do is see which list an item is in. What I have is some lists set up like:  </p>
<pre><code>    l1 = [1,2,3]  
    l2 = [4,5,6]  
    l3 = [7,8,9]  
</code></pre>
<p>And let's say I want to find which list the item 5 is in.
What I'm currently doing is:  </p>
<pre><code>    if l1.index(5)!=False:
        print 1
    elif l2.index(5)!=False:
        print 2
    elif l3.index(5)!=False:
        print 3
</code></pre>
<p>But this doesn't work. How would I do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>in</code> operator to check for membership:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 in [1, 3, 4]
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 in [1, 3, 5]
True
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<pre><code>if l1.index(5)!=False:
    print 1
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>index()</code> method does not return True or False, it returns the index.  So you would change this to:</p>
<pre><code>if l1.index(5) &gt;= 0:
    print 1
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!! Didn't know about that operator before</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What if it's not in the list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's what the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> are for : ).  Actually, it will raise a ValueError.  Switching back from Java I was thinking it would return -1.  At least the part about not comparing the returned value to a boolean literal is correct and helpful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why leave the incorrect part?</span>
