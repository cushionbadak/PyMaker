<p>I'm trying to do a query in sqlite with python, but when I do the research in my database it's just return the last input. Like this</p>
<pre><code>def Busca(self):
        conn = sqlite3.connect('teste.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        valorAtual = str(self.comboBox.currentText())
        if valorAtual == "CNPJ":
            sqlqry = 'SELECT * FROM OrdemServico WHERE CNPJ =' + self.lineEdit_9.text()
            c = cursor.execute(sqlqry)
            retorno = str(c.fetchone())
            retorno = retorno.replace("'","")
            self.textEdit.setText(retorno)
</code></pre>
<p>So this query in sqlite browser returns three values, but in python it just return one.</p>
<p>Does anybody know why?</p>

<p>I suggest you read the documentation carefully to see what you are trying to do: </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.fetchone" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.fetchone</a></p>
<p>Also, here is a blog post around what you are trying to do that uses 'fetchone'. You are pretty much <strong>not</strong> handling your result set properly.</p>
<p>This isn't using the exact module you are using, but the idea is the same.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should use <code>retorno = str(c.fetchall())</code> to get all the results. It would be nice to read the docs as people suggested in the answers. Good luck!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I need to use fetchall()</span>
