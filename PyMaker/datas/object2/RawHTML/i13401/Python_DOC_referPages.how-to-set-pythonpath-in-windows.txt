<p>I tried to run a .py file by typing <code>python twitterstream.py &gt; output.txt</code> in the command prompt of windows 10. It then said</p>
<pre><code>fatal python error: Py_Initialize: unable to load the file system codec
File "C:\Python27\Lib\encodings\__init__.py", line 123 raise CodecRegistryError,\
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>From what I saw through a google search, the solution may be to change the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> env variable. However, I had <code>PYTHONPATH</code> set to <code>C:\Python27</code> for both the user and system variables, but I still get the same error in the command prompt</p>
<p>I also read <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue11288" rel="nofollow">http://bugs.python.org/issue11288</a>, and tried to change all <code>PYTHONPATH</code> system variable which originally pointed to <code>C:\Python27</code> and changed it to <code>C:\Python34</code> but that didn't solve the problem</p>
<p>I then followed <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows</a>, but when I type <code>py</code> it says <code>Python 2.7.9 ..</code>, but for <code>py -3</code> I get a popup saying <code>python.exe has stopped working</code> and </p>
<pre><code> fatal python error: Py_Initialize: unable to load the file system codec
File "C:\Python27\Lib\encodings\__init__.py", line 123 raise CodecRegistryError,\
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>also, <code>py hello.py</code> says <code>from python 2.7.9 ...</code>, but changing <code>#! python</code> to <code>#! python3</code> gives the same error I said before</p>
<p>Even if I set <code>PATH</code> AND <code>PYTHONPATH</code> user variables to <code>C:\Python34;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;C:\Python34\Scripts</code>, along with the <code>PythonPath</code> system variable to <code>C:\Python34;C:\Python27;C:\Python27\Scripts;C:\Python34\Scripts</code>, but the error was the same as before</p>

<p>For some reason by typing only the "py" file name in the command prompt it worked for me. So I typed myScript.py  and it ran correctly. Before this I typed "python myScript.py" and it produced the same error that you experienced. I have the environment variables set <code>PYTHONPATH=c:\python27</code> and <code>PYTHONHOME=c:\python27</code>. I hope this helps.</p>

<p>At the start of your program include the line</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python3

<p>Windows will use this to run your code in Python 3.4 rather than 2.7</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It seems you have <code>PYTHONHOME</code> set to <code>C:\Python27</code>. Generally there's no reason to set either <code>PYTHONPATH</code> or <code>PYTHONHOME</code>, not with the official Python distributions. Unset these variables. There are better ways to manage <code>sys.path</code> for a particular installation that don't cause such conflicts.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i don't see <code>PYTHONHOME</code> as an environment variable. And when you say unset, you mean delete them? When I tried that on <code>PYTHONPATH</code>, I got the same error as before</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I can reproduce the error if I first enter <code>set "PYTHONHOME=C:\Python27"</code>. This overrides Python's default <code>sys.prefix</code>, by which it finds its standard library. Python 3 obviously can't use Python 2's standard library. In the command prompt enter <code>set PYTHON</code>. Does this list <code>PYTHONHOME</code> or just <code>PYTHONPATH</code>? If it's just <code>PYTHONPATH</code>, that should not cause that error when running <code>py -3</code>. Something else is wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when I enter <code>set PYTHON</code> it says <code>Environment variable PYTHON not defined</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That means neither <code>PYTHONHOME</code> nor <code>PYTHONPATH</code> is set. In that command prompt do you get the error for <code>py -3</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but even if I try that on <code>twitterstream.py</code>, I get the same error. I also got that error for <code>hello.py</code> as explained in that python documentation page I linked to</span>
<span class="comment-copy">don't run it as python twitterstream.py, just run twitterstream.py from the command prompt and it should launch python3 instead of the default 2.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok with that, I don't get the error message anymore. However, I don't think it worked properly because there should be some content in <code>output.txt</code>, but it is still blank. The code for <code>twitterstream.py</code> is <a href="https://github.com/uwescience/datasci_course_materials/blob/master/assignment1/twitterstream.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/uwescience/datasci_course_materials/blob/master/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">do you get the correct output without piping output to your text file?  Windows tends to leave the output file empty until the process finishes, so if it takes a long time it can look like its failed (esp if running from task schedular)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when I run <code>twitterstream.py</code> in Ninja, in the output I see some HTML content, which I assume is the correct output. However, <code>output.txt</code> is still empty</span>
