<p>I am new to Python and I have programmed a very basic program which opens a pre-made file reads it, then closes it, through normal Python syntax:</p>
<pre><code>f = open("file", "r+")
f.read()
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>However, once run, this program produces no output.</p>
<p>Is there a problem with my syntax, or is there an error in my PyCharm installation?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is supposed to happen. <code>f.read()</code> does not print things to the screen. It returns them, just like <code>open()</code> returns <code>f</code>.  If you want to print things, you need to call the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print()</code></a> function (under Python 3) or use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-print-statement" rel="nofollow"><code>print</code></a> statement (under Python 2).</p>
