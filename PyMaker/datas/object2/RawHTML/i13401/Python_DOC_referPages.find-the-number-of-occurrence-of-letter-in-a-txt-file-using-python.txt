<p>I need to read the letter from a .txt file and print the number of occurrence in txt file. so far i have been able to print the content in one line but having issue with the count, can someone please guide.</p>
<pre><code>infile = open('grades.txt')  
content = infile.read() 
for char in content:
        print (char, end=' ')
</code></pre>
<p>this will read the letter from the txt file but i am not able to count the occurrence. </p>
<p>using below counter gives me 1 </p>
<pre><code>print (char.counter(char))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> for this</p>
<pre><code>with open('grades.txt') as f:
    print(Counter(f.read()))
</code></pre>
<p>Example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is a test that has letters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Output</p>
<pre><code>Counter({'t': 7,
         ' ': 6,
         's': 5,
         'a': 3,
         'h': 3,
         'e': 3,
         'i': 2,
         'l': 1,
         'r': 1})
</code></pre>
<p>Or to only include letters</p>
<pre><code>from string import ascii_letters
with open('grades.txt') as f:
    print(Counter(i for i in f.read() if i in ascii_letters))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit</strong><br/>
Without the use of any other libraries, the manual way to do the same thing as above:</p>
<pre><code>from string import ascii_letters
d = {}
with open('grades.txt') as f:
    for letter in d.read():
        if letter in ascii_letters:
            if letter in d:
                d[letter] += 1
            else:
                d[letter] = 1
</code></pre>
<p>If your file looks something like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A A+ B B- B B+ B+ A A- B+</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the modification to the above code would be</p>
<pre><code>d = {}
with open('grades.txt') as f:
    for grade in d.read().split():
        if grade in d:
            d[grade] += 1
        else:
            d[grade] = 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here you go. Hopefully your professor will ask you to explain your work.</p>
<pre><code>grades = open('grades.txt').read().split()
for grade in sorted(set(grades),
                    key=lambda x: ord(x[0])*3-('+'in x)+('-'in x)):
    print ('{} students got {}'.format(grades.count(grade), grade))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">well, why should it give you anything else? <code>char</code> contains a single char, so obviously its count will be <code>1</code>.... you need to count the entire string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">we are not allowed to use counter yet, thank you for the help.</span>
