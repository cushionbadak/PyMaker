<p>You have two questions. Pun only one question per StackOverflow question. This   addresses only the first one.</p>
<p>To capture the stdout or stderr output from a program you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output" rel="nofollow">subprocess.check_output()</a>.</p>
<p>"Run command with arguments and return its output."</p>
<p>Example:  </p>
<pre><code>  import subprocess

  output = subprocess.check_output("dmidecode")
  print(output.decode("utf-8"))  # Convert from bytes to string
</code></pre>
<p>When you have the output available you can ask the question how to parse it, and what you want to do with the parsed data.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Better to give more explanation. Show them original array format and your commands(at-least sample)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can refer the following stackoverflow link <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13814428/python-linux-dmidecode-how-to-obtain-hw-info-by-parsing" title="python linux dmidecode how to obtain hw info by parsing">stackoverflow.com/questions/13814428/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have no idea what the first program has to do with the second program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My question is how to execute external command and capture the output and parse it? To the above code i mentioned?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I got output but i want to parse the values of first 3 values and display the output one-by-one.@Mikko Ohtamaa</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@rohit_777: For parsing the output open a new StackOverflow question with the sample output and what you want to do with the data</span>
