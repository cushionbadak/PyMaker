<p>I am trying to make a url email crawler. I want to pull a line from a text file, use it once and delete it. </p>
<p>Here is my code.</p>
<pre><code>with open('urls.txt', 'r') as f:
    first_line = f.readline()
    print first_line

with open('urls.txt' , 'w') as file:    
    file.write("0")
</code></pre>
<p>I an new here and I realize my code looks funny and I'm not sure why. </p>
<p>This is for an email scraping script I found online. It is set to enter the urls as rawdata. I want it to take the first line from a txt file that will include the urls and delete after each use and continue to run the script until the list is empty.</p>
<p>[code]
    #!/usr/bin/python</p>
<pre><code>import sys
import urllib2
import re

with open('urls.txt', 'r') as f:
   first_line = f.readline()

def getAddress():
    url = raw_input('What Site?')
    http = "http://"
    https = "https://"

    if http in url:
    return url
    elif https in url:
        return url
     else:
        url = "http://" + url
        return url

def parseAddress():
    try:
        website = urllib2.urlopen(getAddress())
        html = website.read()

        addys = re.findall('''[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-    9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?''', html, flags=re.IGNORECASE)

    print addys

except urllib2.HTTPError, err:
    print "Cannot retrieve URL: HTTP Error Code: ", err.code

    print "Cannot retrive URL: " + err.reason[1]

<p>Here is one way to do it;</p>
<pre><code># Read the file as a list of strings, each string is a line.
with open('urls.txt', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Delete the first line.
del lines[0]

# Write the rest back to the file.
with open('urls.txt' , 'w') as f:
    f.writelines(lines)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Given your expanded question, you seem to want to iterate over a list of URLs? If I understood this correctly, a better way to do it would be:</p>
<pre><code># Read the file as a list of strings, each string is a line.
with open('urls.txt', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Add http:// if necessary:
lines = ['http://'+ln if not ln.startswith('http://') else ln for ln in lines]

# loop over all the URLs
for url in lines:
    parseAddress(url)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">why do you want to delete the line? It's a heavy operation on a file. There may be a better way to achieve your goals</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what are you actually trying to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In the edited question you read a line from a file but never use it? You seem to use <code>raw_input</code> instead? Additionally, your edited code isn't correctly indented.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is deleting all lines of the txt file and adding a 0 on line 1.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@curphey It is true that this overwrites the file: that is how files work. As for the 0, I suggest that you look at what the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#the-del-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">del statement</a> does. In this case it deletes the first string from the list of strings that is called <code>lines</code>.</span>
