<p>I'm trying to save the answers from a GUI that has radio buttons that has different value ranging from A, B and C, but when I'm trying my code it completely rewrite the first letters and not going to the next line. </p>

<p>Every time your code does this:</p>
<pre><code>textfile = open("studentexam.txt", "w")
</code></pre>
<p>you are opening the file afresh and overwriting what was there before. The same as File | Save does in an application, except that your code doesn't ask "Are you sure?". Use mode <code>"a"</code> instead of <code>"w"</code>.</p>
<p>From the documentation for <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">open()</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most commonly-used values of mode are 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), and 'a' for appending.</p>

<p>ps. try to avoid duplication of the code when each function does same functionality ... if possible of course.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>open("studentexam.txt", "a")</code>.  Use mode <code>"a"</code> to append.  Read more here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=open#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=open#open</a> mode <code>"w"</code> truncates and overwrite your file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i need the letters to be save like a\n b\n c\n d\n e\n</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>textfile.write("A\n")</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you need to open and close your file for each function call separately? Maybe better solution would be opening file once at start and closing at end?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i'd try "a" sir but mode a continuously adding letters, i need to make my text file blank after the rerun. Is it possible sir?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what approach or functions I could use to make my file became blank again after opening ? because it continuously writing letters. I need to make it that in every end of the run it will save. but if the user run it again it will became blank so it doesn't continue</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One way: Provide another function attached to a button called <i>Clear file</i> that opens the file in mode <code>"w"</code> and immediately closes it again without writing anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can i attach the function that i will make into the submit button or i will make a different button for the clear files sir ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Up to you. I don't really know exactly what your program is supposed to do. That is why I said in my comment that is was <i>one way</i> to do it. Your question was about <i>how</i> to clear the file: you know that now. But only you can say <i>when</i> you want that to happen.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ask a new question, including your program with the fixes so far, say what is happening and what you want to happen. Comments are not handy for this.</span>
