<p>I'm doing one of my first assignments and I can't find out how to put parentheses around a variable when I go to print it.</p>
<p>I've tried
(xs)
{xs}
[xs}
But none get parentheses around it</p>
<pre><code>(print)("Hello user! Welcome to the program!")
 name = input("What is your name?")
(print)("Hello", name)
x = input("What is your favorite number?")
y = int(x) // 2
xs = str(x)
ys = str(y)
z = ("Did you know that half of your favorite number" + ' ' + xs + ' ' + 'is' + ' ' + ys + '?')
</code></pre>
<p>print(z)</p>
<p>For the 2nd to last line of code I want it to say Did you know that half of your number (5) is 2?</p>
<h1>5 is just an example number but I want it in parentheses!</h1>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do it like so:</p>
<pre><code>z = ("Did you know that half of your favorite number" + ' (' + xs + ') ' + 'is' + ' ' + ys + '?')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you just need to add the pharentesis in the right place, something like this:</p>
<p>z = ("Did you know that half of your favorite number" + ' (' + xs + ') ' + 'is' + ' ' + ys + '?')</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am not exactly sure if that is what you need but you just have to concat <code>"("</code> and <code>")"</code> around your variable.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; y = "number"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print ( "(" + y + ")" )
(number)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Put second last line as <code>z = "Did you know that half of your favorite number" + ' (' + xs + ') ' + 'is' + ' ' + ys + '?'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do yourself a favor and follow a good tutorial to learn the language.Your code has far too much parenthesis in it. Read about string formating here: <a href="https://pyformat.info/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pyformat.info</a> and google python f-string  if you are indeed on python 3.6+  - if you simply googled "how to print a number in a string python" you would have gotten thousands of solution to this problem. Tutorial: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a>  .. printing starts where strings are explained: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#fancier-output-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">better to use <code>str.format()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">of course, I'm just modifying his code.. it's easier for him/her!</span>
