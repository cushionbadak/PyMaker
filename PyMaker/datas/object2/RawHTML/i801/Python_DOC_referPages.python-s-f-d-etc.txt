<p>I am new to python and I was on this website: <a href="https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types</a> 
suddenly, at the bottom there are these characters like %f %d %s %.
Does anyone know what it means???</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is the Exercise:</p>
<p>As it says, <strong>%s</strong> (of string) is to replace a string, <strong>%f</strong> (of float) is to replace a float, and <strong>%d</strong> (of integer) is to replace an integer</p>
<pre><code># change this code
mystring = "hello"
myfloat = 10.0
myint = 20

# testing code
if mystring == "hello":
    print("String: %s" % mystring)
if isinstance(myfloat, float) and myfloat == 10.0:
    print("Float: %f" % myfloat)
if isinstance(myint, int) and myint == 20:
    print("Integer: %d" % myint)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! @Tomothy32</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just a heads up, don't use this notation. <code>.format()</code> and f-strings are preferred in Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that Python also supports a newer style of string formatting that doesn't use <code>%</code> via its built-in string <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>format()</code></a> method.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright I'll take note of that.</span>
