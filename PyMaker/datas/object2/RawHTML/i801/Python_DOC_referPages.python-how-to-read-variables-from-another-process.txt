<p>So i'm building a custom machine learning simulation and wanting to read certain values from a training process, in another one to visualize real time training data.</p>
<p>So for example, the training simulation has an array of values under a data structure. Let's say the data structure is an instantiated class called <code>data</code>. Inside this class, there is a list of values, let's call it <code>values</code>.</p>
<p>This simulation has a training loop, so while that training loop is going, I would like to run another script that can query <code>data.values</code> and do something with it.</p>
<p>Is this possible? - Ideally I would like to keep my simulation code as is so as to not add necessary bulk.</p>

<p>You can use a message queue for that. Add the value to the queue in your loop process and read and visualize with the other application. Take a look at <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RabbitMQ</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">The first thing that comes to my mind "have you tried a fork?", I might be wrong though</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you can setup communication between your processes using a socket. Did you read this : <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/ipc.html</a> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Eggplant what do you mean by a fork?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Antwane I think a socket would be the way to go, but I would also like a route where I can effectively read the memory from one process to another soas to be a more general solution. But for my problem, this may be the way to go.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The solution suggested by @SBylemans (RabbitMQ) could also be really useful. You should have a look at it ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm, this seems promising. I'll have to try it out when I'm able. Thanks for the recommendation.</span>
