<p>I have tried a number of posts/suggestions on here on converting time zone objects and have failed.  I hope someone can point me to an easy way to do this.</p>
<p>I have a string/datetime of <code>2017-05-11T16:24:56-04:00</code>
I can parse it a number of ways, dateutil, etc, into a datetime object.
when printed i get</p>
<p><code>datetime.datetime(2017, 5, 11, 16, 24, 56, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -14400))</code></p>
<p>so it gets a tzoffset.</p>
<p>Trying any conversion doesn't seem to update the actual time portion, just the zone information.</p>
<p>How do I convert this string to my local time zone (EST, or offset -5hrs).</p>
<p>edit: trying astimezone() gets me this:</p>
<pre><code>dt.astimezone()                                                                   
Out[18]: datetime.datetime(2017, 5, 11, 16, 24, 56, 
tzinfo=datetime.timezone(datetime.timedelta(-1, 72000), 'EDT'))
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>When you convert it using <code>tzinfo</code> you only change the suffix of the output string (e.g. with tzutc()): <code>2017-05-11 16:24:56+00:00</code></p>
<p>If you want to print it in your time zone, first create the datetime object using the actual timezone it represents:</p>
<pre><code>dt = datetime(2017, 5, 11, 16, 24, 56,
              tzinfo=tzoffset(None, -18000))
# 2017-05-11 16:24:56-05:00
</code></pre>
<p>And then convert it to the desired timezone using:</p>
<pre><code>mydt = dt.astimezone(tzutc())
# 2017-05-11 21:24:56+00:00
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@Norrius tried that, didn't work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Norrius perhaps it is working... I think i've mistaken not working, for it realizing i'm at -4 hours because of daylight savings :( trying to confirm.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i've been trying that and i think it works, my issue is i'm creating the datetime via parsing a string.  which seems to work with dateutil parser, but having issues getting it converted... however, i think my issue is i didn't realize i'm in UTC-4 due to daylight savings EDT (not EST which is -5).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@warath-coder, I'm happy it works for you. I'm not sure if you need help with anything else. Are you having issues with parsing the string to a datetime object?</span>
