<p>Using the read() and open() functions whilst using Python 3.7</p>
<p>Is there a reason that <code>open()</code> is documented but <code>read()</code> is not?</p>

<p>Because <code>read()</code> is NOT a built-in function, as it's not present as <code>builtins.read</code>. Instead, it's a method of <code>_io.BufferedReader</code> class. That means you have to create an object of that class (usually with the built-in function <code>open()</code>), and call <code>read()</code> for the object.</p>

<p>Because <code>read()</code> is a method of a <code>file-object</code></p>

<p><code>read</code> is not a Python as others have said. It's a method that you will find for many I/O object such as file objects, http requests, and more.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">read is not a built in function. There's a read method on file objects though</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then why can I utilise it in a Python 3.7 installation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How are you using it? Show us sample code</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>open()</code> is an in-built function, whereas <code>read()</code> is not. It's but a function on file handler. You do <code>&lt;file_handler&gt;.read()</code> not just <code>read()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sample code provided.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where can I find this documented on the Python website? I expect on doing a Google search 'Python open() function' to find the right official docs listed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user1554264, About <code>open</code>: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user1554264, In <code>open</code> documentation, you can follow <code>file-object</code> documentation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user1554264, <code>file-object</code> glossary contains <code>io</code> module documentation (which contains description of  <code>*IOBase</code>s, <code>*Reader</code>, ...)  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#module-io" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#module-io</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So am I correct in saying I would not be able to call read() before open() as I have not instantiated an object of that class?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user1554264 Or more precisely, you don't <i>have an instance</i> (note: <code>sys.stdin</code> is an object that has <code>read()</code>, which is automatically opened)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm learning from a Python book that was recommended to me, however the language the author uses is fairly concerning - 'Line 7 prints a little message, but on line 8 we have something very new and exciting. We call a function on txt named read. What you get back from open is a file, and it also has commands you can give it.' It doesn't feel exhaustive or technical enough, in other words feels like I'm learning the wrong stuff from it.</span>
