<p>I am new to Selenium. The web interface of our product pops up a EULA agreement which the user has to scroll down and accept before proceeding. This happens ONLY on initial login using that browser for that user. </p>
<p>I looked at the Selenium API but I am unable to figure out which one to use and how to use it.</p>
<p>Would much appreciate any suggestions in this regard.</p>
<p>I have played around with the IDE for Chrome but even over there I don't see anything that I can use for this. I am aware there is an 'if' command but I don't know how to use it to do something like:</p>
<p>if EULA-pops-up:
   Scroll down and click 'accept'</p>
<p>proceed with rest of test.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You may disable the EULA if that is an option for you, I am sure there is a way to do it in registries as well :</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application there should be a file called master_preferences.</p>
<p>Open the file and setting:</p>
<p>require_eula to false</p>

<p>If you use the <code>kantu</code> <a href="https://a9t9.com/kantu/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">selenium ide</a> you have the very useful variable <a href="https://a9t9.com/kantu/docs/#!errorignore" rel="nofollow noreferrer">!errorignore</a></p>
<p>With this, your test case can look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>store | true | !errorignore</li>
<li>now the code to close the EULA <em>(if the eula is not found, the script just continues because it ignores this issue)</em></li>
<li>store | false | !errorignore</li>
<li>main test case script starts here</li>
</ul>

It will be to your benefit to complete your <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tour">tour</a> and check out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a>.  Namely, your question should provide specific code in a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> to help us help you, as it stands it is too broad.  In any case, in Python it is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-eafp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">easier to ask for forgiveness</a>, so you can build a code to specifically handle the EULA and wrap it around <code>try... except...</code> block.  In which even if the EULA doesn't show up, it won't block the rest of your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What exactly do you mean by "which one to use"? The options you are trying to decide between aren't clear to me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You've tagged your question with python - share your code tries up until know, the community will help you finish it - it's an easy enough task. Also add the relevant html of the popup, to get its specific elements.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think OP is asking about an EULA pop up in their product, not Chrome itself.</span>
