<p>I'm calling subprocess.run to execute an external program outside. However the program requires administrative rights, I run the program using administrator but the python console prompts me for a password, but doesn't let me input the password and exits the program.</p>
<p>I've tried using <code>subprocess.popen</code> and <code>subprocess.call</code>, I've also tried running the program without administrative rights but pycharm will throw me a operation requires elevation error.</p>
<pre><code>def runExecutables():
    directory = r"C:\Users\Billy\Desktop\SURVEY_PROGRAM_WINDOWS_ENGLISH.exe"
    #subprocess.Popen(directory)

    subprocess.run(['runas', '/user:Administrator', directory])
    #prog.stdin.write(b'password')
    #prog.communicate()
</code></pre>
<p>I should be expecting, either the executable to run, or a prompt that pops up asking for the password to be inputted, proving to me that the executable is indeed being run. I am just getting a python prompt to enter the pass for administrator and it does not wait for me to enter the password before finishing the process.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>With Popen, you have to pipe in stdin and flush the input</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import subprocess

p = subprocess.Popen(['runas', '/user:Administrator', 'calc.exe'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE)
p.stdin.write(b'YourPassword\n')
p.stdin.flush()
stdout, stderr = p.communicate()
print("-----------")
print(stdout)
print("-----------")
print(stderr)
</code></pre>

<p>I have avoided this problem by approaching it using command prompt rather than using subprocess.</p>
<pre><code>def runExecutables():
     os.system(r"start C:\Users\Mastodon\Desktop\SURVEY_PROGRAM_WINDOWS_ENGLISH.exe")
</code></pre>
<p>Using command prompt alleviates some of the problems that subprocess would inflict. I am unclear as to what the advantages of using subprocess are. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">that solution, doesn't execute the program when I run it in pycharm. It still prints the prompt of entering the password except this time it spits out random characters after the prompt.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">have to tried executing it from cmd prompt first. See if "runas /user:Administrator C:\Users\Billy\Desktop\SURVEY_PROGRAM_WINDOWS_ENGLISH.exe" works fine in your cmd prompt</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yea i ran the program in cmd, i did runas, i got the prompt for the password, and the executable was run</span>
