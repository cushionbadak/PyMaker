<p>I am trying to use two string inside the following list and want to use one string two times. I mean I do not want to write one word twice inside my list or tuple.</p>
<p>My output is - </p>
<p>Hi, Maggie. Maggie I will go to market to buy pencil and book.</p>
<p>Hi, Lulu. Lulu I will go to market to buy pencil and book.</p>
<p>But my error is : tuple index out of range
Is it possible to write maggie / lulu one time inside my tuple and use it in two places?</p>
<p>My code is:</p>
<pre><code>first_tuple = ("magi","book","pencil")
second_tuple = ("lulu","copy","eraser")

together = (first_tuple, second_tuple)
New_List = list(together)


for i in range (len(New_List)):
    print ("Hi, {}. {} I will go to market to buy {} and {} .".format(*New_List[i]))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use</p>
<pre><code>print ("Hi, {0}. {0} I will go to market to buy {1} and {2} .".format(*New_List[i]))
</code></pre>
<p>The numbers in braces are an index into the list of format parameters. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a> for details.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, that worked, thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If I want to use: %s like:                 print ("Hi, %s[0]. %s[0] I will go to market to buy %s[1] and %s[2] ." %(New_List[i]))           --my code is not working. What can I do solve this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hapy Repeating the same item twice and using index numbers is not possible with the old, printf-based <code>%</code>-formatting language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok got it thank you</span>
