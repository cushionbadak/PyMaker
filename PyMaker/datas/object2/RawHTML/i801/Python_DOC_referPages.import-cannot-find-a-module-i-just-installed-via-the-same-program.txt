<p>I am writing a python installer script that needs to install 2 additional modules via pip inside the script, then import and use those modules to finish the installation in the same script. The pip call works fine, but when I attempt to import the module (<em>winshell</em>) I just installed, I get an error that it cannot import another module (win32con) which is part of the second module I installed (<em>pywin32</em>).</p>
<p>If I re-run the script after the error, everything works like it should, so I know the actual pip installs are working correctly. I seems like the running python script just doesn't know about some of the installed modules until the program is re-run. Is there a way to make a running script "update" the modules it sees available without having to re-run the program? </p>
<p>Here is the simplified code:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import sys
try:
    from pip import main as pipmain
except ImportError:
    from pip._internal import main as pipmain

def create_shortcut():
    print 'Creating shortcut...'
    import winshell

    link_filepath = os.path.join(winshell.desktop(), "Start.lnk")
    with winshell.shortcut(link_filepath) as link:
        link.path = sys.executable
        link.description = "Shortcut to startup"
        link.arguments = r"C:\temp\my_program.py"

def install_requirements():
    print 'Installing requirements...'
    pipmain(['install', '-r', 'wheelhouse/requirements.txt', '--no-index', '--find-links', 'wheelhouse'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    install_requirements()
    create_shortcut()
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the error:</p>

<p>This is a possible solution that I would recommend you to check:</p>
<p>try installing <code>pypiwin32</code> using <code>pip install pypiwin32</code></p>
<p>This problem does not seem to be related to your code, but rather to the module installation itself. I still find it weird since it works well when you run it the second time, but still worth giving a try</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you install new modules during a program's execution, you need to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.invalidate_caches" rel="nofollow noreferrer">invalidate the module finder caches</a> to make sure the import system sees the new modules:</p>
<pre><code>import importlib
importlib.invalidate_caches()
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>be careful that never chose the file name same as your library or modules name.
for example if I want to use of requests and import it, if I chose my file name 'requests'
when Run the code will raise error </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you give more details about your code? and also the exact error message you get ! It would help understand better what the issue might be</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you edit with the exact error? The question is way too vague</span>
