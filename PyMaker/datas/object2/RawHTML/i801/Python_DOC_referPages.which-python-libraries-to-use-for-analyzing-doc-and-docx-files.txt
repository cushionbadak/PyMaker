<p>I am writing a doc and docx parser. It is necessary to obtain various metadata about the document of these formats. For example, for docx, I need to get the XML code and continue to work with the tags. Tell me the solutions that will help solve my problem? Solutions like python-docx are not suitable, because they work only with text.</p>

<p>If you need raw <code>docx</code> data, you'll probably work with it low-level, i.e. open file with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zipfile</code></a> and read meta with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">xml etree</a></p>
