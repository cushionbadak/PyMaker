<p>I have code that checks if there's any space or is it just empty. I tried remaking the =, "", '',  ==. But I didn't succeed. What's the problem? When I'm entering the password its always says the error, that I have in print function.</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    password = getpass.getpass("~ Please pick a password, for user - {n}\n".format(n=name))
    fontas = " "
    fontas2 = ' '
    if fontas and fontas2 in password:
        print("~ Password can't contain a spaces!\n")
        continue
    else:
        break
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT*
I'm adding a GIF. Which Shows you how this works now, when i changed a code a bit.</p>
<p>First try I'm trying to make a space, after I'm not typing anything, And the last time i put normal keyword - ffawt</p>
<p>*I Cannot add GIF Files, So I'm uploading link in Gyazo platform.</p>

<p>I hope this helps:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    Password = input('Enter a password: ')
    if " " in Password or len(Password) == 0:
        print("~ Password can't contain a spaces!")
        continue

    #if 'if' statement evaluates to True
    print(Password)
    break
</code></pre>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>Although this will 'Get the job done', There are other ways to evaluate if a string is empty in python! </p>
<p>An empty string will evaluate to a boolean value (False):</p>
<pre><code>Password = ""
if not Password:
      print("isempty")
&gt;&gt;&gt; isempty
</code></pre>
<p>That being said, The code above can be refactored as:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
      Password = input('Enter a password: ')
      #Make 'falsy' evaluation of password
      if not Password or " " in Password:
          print("~ Password can't contain a spaces!")
          continue

     #if 'if' statement evaluates to True
      print(Password)
      break
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should be using a regular expression. A regular Expression can check for <code>" "</code> in strings.E.g.</p>
<pre><code>fontas = password.match(' ')
if fontas:
    print('Match found: ', fontas.group())
else:
    print('No match')
</code></pre>

<p>To check if the provided string is empty, or contains any spaces do this</p>
<pre><code>while True:

    password = getpass.getpass("~ Please pick a password, for user {n}\n".format(n=name))
    fontas = " "
    if fontas in password:
        print("~ Password can't contain a spaces!\n")
        continue
    elif password == '':
        print("~ Password cannot be empty!\n")
        continue
    else:
        break
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I believe this is what you want:</p>
<pre><code>if password and (" " in password):
    print("BAD")
else
    print("GOOD")
</code></pre>
<p>it first check if there is a password at all, then check if there is a space</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>fontas</code> and <code>fontas2</code> are the same, you can just do</p>
<pre><code>if ' ' in password:
    print("~ Password can't contain a spaces!\n")
    # ...
</code></pre>
<p>A full example:</p>
<pre><code>import getpass

# ...

name = 'Alex' # considering a user called Alex

while True:
    password = getpass.getpass(
        "~ Please pick a password, for user - {n}\n".format(n=name))
    fontas = " "
    if fontas in password:
        print("~ Password can't contain a spaces!\n")
        continue
    elif not password:

<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand the point of <code>if fontas</code>. The value can't change</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That makes absolutely no sense. Firstly there's no difference between <code>" "</code> and <code>' '</code>. Secondly, if there was, it should be an <code>or </code> combination, not <code>and</code>. Thirdly you aren't checking if both values are in the password with that, which should be <code>fontas in password and fontas2 in password</code>.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">If password would be - " Rauna51" it would be error because of space right? but What if input is empty? - "" Blank? I use the Fontas = '' Sorry for space beetwhen ' ' in the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's an empty string in <b>every</b> string, empty or not: <code>"" in ""</code>, <code>"" in "password"</code>, <code>"" in "pass word"</code> are all true.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that's working. Thanks :)!</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>len(Password) == 0</code> isn't a very nice check for an empty string, and the resulting error message doesn't actually match the problem with the input.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe The print message does not match 100% with the logic but he wanted a block that: checks if there's any space ` if " " in Password` in the password string, is just empty <code>len(Password) == 0</code>. How would you update this block</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You did not explian to OP what is wrong with his code. You should not compute the length to check for emptiness. I would not be surprised if this is getting downvoted</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BlueSheepToken, Thanks for bringing this to my attention :)! I have made some edits to predicate string emptiness logic on Falsy evaluation rather than string length. This should handle the edge cases more smoothly</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why would that be necessary? <code>fontas2 in password</code> is fine, and more efficient than a regex, it's everything else that's the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't help at all.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Obviously it's not, otherwise you wouldnt be running into this kind of issue. If you are handling passwords you probably want to check for more than just spaces, so a Regular Expression would be very useful anyways.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's no point in the first part of that condition; if it's an empty string, it definitely won't contain a space!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't help, well I don't understand what's the problem behind these codes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You see, you did a code, which see's if there's any space, but it won't check if the code is null, empty.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want to check if no password has been provided, check the edited answer.</span>
