<p>I was wondering how I would be able to plot values from two lists that I split from a text file, into a scatterplot?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try -    </p>
<pre><code>def read_earthquake_lat_long_mag(filename):
    ifile= open(filename, "r")
    lines= ifile.readlines()
    data=[tuple(line.split()) for line in lines]
    return data[1:3]
(lat, long, mag) = read_earthquake_lat_long_mag("earthquake_all_month.csv")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Open the file; split each line into <em>words</em>; if a word is a <em>number</em> keep it; <em>add</em> the numbers in each line to the result.</p>
<pre><code>def read_earthquake_lat_long_mag(filename):
    result = []
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        for line in file:
            numbers = []
            line = line.strip()
            line = line.split()
            for word in line:
                if word.isdigit():
                    numbers.append(word)
            if numbers:
                result.append(numbers)
    return result
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>By best guess would be using regular expression <strong>[0-9]+</strong>
this would check for number in the text. I dont know which language you are using but java has a function called <strong>match</strong>. You match it with the <strong>regular expression</strong> and the <strong>text</strong> and you will get the answer </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think that it should work. I tried it. I dont know if you are using comma or dot.</p>
<p><code>data=[tuple(re.findall(r'\d+,\d+', line)) for line in lines]</code></p>
<p>You need to import re at the top of you python script.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You can test the <i>words</i> in the text using - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to start using <code>with</code> when working with files: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually everything you read from a file is a string. If you want numbers you have to convert the strings to numbers. You can just discard any input that makes the conversion fail ant you will have just the numbers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should include a few (5-10?) lines of the file you are parsing - enough to test solutions. Also include the expected result for the example file.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank You, but this wouldn't work unfortunately. I got the following error: ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2) I think it is because of the index in return data[1:3], and when it is zero I still get the words when all I want is numbers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would need that file to help you out.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank You. I'm now trying to graph this function!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank You, this worked</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My code is as follows and I get an error: import re def read_earthquake_lat_long_mag(filename):     ifile= open(filename, "r")     lines= ifile.readlines()     data=[tuple(re.findall(r'\d+,\d+', line)) for line in lines]     return data[0:3] # Ending solution import matplotlib.pyplot as plt %matplotlib inline  (lat, long, mag) = read_earthquake_lat_long_mag("earthquake_all_month.csv")  plt.scatter(long, lat) plt.title("Earthquake Locations") plt.show()  print(read_earthquake_lat_long_mag("earthquake_all_month.csv"))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">^^^ I was wondering if you could help me with one more thing. How would I turn the following into a scatter plot graph?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure - you will  need to convert the strings to floats then spend some time with the <code>matplotlib</code> documentation to figure out the best way to visuliize your data. There are <b>lots</b> of examples in <a href="https://matplotlib.org/2.1.1/gallery/index.html#pyplot-examples" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Gallery</a> but I suggest you spend time with the <a href="https://matplotlib.org/2.1.1/tutorials/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Matplotlib Tutorial</a> so you will know how it works.  There are many SO q&amp;a's regarding plotting with Matplotlib.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The question has a <code>python</code> tag.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using python, thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">May be this code will help. import re; txt = "The rain23.44 in Spsdf3.43ain" x = re.findall("[0-9]+\.[0-9]+", txt). This will return all the decimal numbers within a text as an array i assume.</span>
