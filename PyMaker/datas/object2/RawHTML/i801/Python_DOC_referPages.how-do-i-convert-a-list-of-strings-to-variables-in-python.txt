<p>For example, if I have S=['a','b','c'], I want to have 3 variables a_value=0, b_value=0, c_value=0. Maybe I am approaching it a wrong way, but at the moment that is what I am trying to do!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can assign the list items with commas</p>
<pre><code>S=['a','b','c']
S[0], S[1], S[2] = 0,0,0
print(S)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
[0, 0, 0]
</code></pre>

<p>Python allows you to dynamically create global (not local) variables by setting them in the dictionary returned by the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#globals" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>globals()</code></a> function. Using your list would look like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>S = ['a', 'b', 'c']
for v in S:
    globals()[f'{v}_value'] = 0

print(a_value)
print(b_value)
print(c_value)
</code></pre>
<p>which prints</p>
<pre><code>0
0
0
</code></pre>
<p>as expected. Note that the scope of a "global variable" in Python is the module in which the <code>globals()</code> function is called - this may be different than what you would expect coming from other languages.</p>
<p>As mentioned in comments, there is almost always a better approach that leads to nicer code that is easier to debug.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">a_value, b_value, c_value = ['a', 'b', 'c']?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, dynamic variable names is always approaching it the wrong way. Maybe looking for a dict, <code>values = {'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0}</code> where you can access <code>values[x]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The section of the docs that you linked says:  <i>Note:The contents of this dictionary should not be modified</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wim, thanks - updated to use <code>globals()</code>.</span>
