<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to make a class who's instances are choices from a set of choices. E.g. the instance is a game piece chosen from a set of game pieces.</p>
<p>I thought a good way to go about this is to store the game pieces in the class and when a class instance is initialised, it is set to a certain piece.
The below code doesn't work as I've found out, what's the best way to go about this?</p>
<pre><code>class MyClass():
    choices=["foo","bar"]
    def __init__(self,choice):
        self.var=choices[choice]

myinstance=MyClass(0)
print(myinstance.var) #I wan't this to be "foo"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can just do:</p>
<pre><code>class MyClass():
def __init__(self,choice):
    self.choices=["foo","bar"]
    self.var=self.choices[choice]

myinstance=MyClass(0)
print(myinstance.var) # It should work now
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps! :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I see I completely misunderstood how the class variables work. Coincidentally, is this overall a good way to approach the problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, this is a good way. If you want, you can declare the choices using a class Enum (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html</a>)</span>
