<p>I'm using Mac 10.13.6 with Python 3.7.  I use PyCharm for development.  Although I can run commands fine in the PyCharm management console, when I try and run the same commands in a terminal, I get errors complaining taht I don't have Django installed.  For instance</p>
<pre><code>localhost:mainpage_project davea$ python manage.py runstats
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "manage.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django'

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "manage.py", line 14, in &lt;module&gt;
    ) from exc
ImportError: Couldn't import Django. Are you sure it's installed and available on your PYTHONPATH environment variable? Did you forget to activate a virtual environment?
</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps I defined my PYTHONPATH incorrectly, but I set it to my Python executable</p>
<pre><code>localhost:mainpage_project davea$ which python
/usr/local/bin/python

localhost:mainpage_project davea$ echo $PYTHONPATH
/usr/local/bin/python
</code></pre>
<p>What should be the value of PYTHONPATH?  I'm able to run the command fine within PyCharm, it's only in the terminal that things start throwing errors.</p>

<p>In pycharm you have Django installed (Check for an environment folder). </p>
<p>In order to use it in the terminal outside of pycharm either find the environment folder and activate it (source /bin/activate).</p>
<p>If a virtual environment does not exist, use this guide to create one: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html</a></p>
<p>You could also (NOT RECOMMENDED!) install it system wide: 
    pip install django</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Navigate to where you are attempting to run from and set your PTYHONPATH to that directory:</p>
<pre><code>export PYTHONPATH=.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your terminal you could navigate to your pycharm project venv folder and do :</p>
<pre><code>cd mainpage_project/venv
source bin/activate
</code></pre>
<p>Then you run your script:</p>
<pre><code>(venv) localhost:mainpage_project davea$ python manage.py runstats
</code></pre>
<p>You could also install python system wide (not recommended) and then run your script:</p>
<pre><code>pip install django
</code></pre>
<p>Then you run your script:</p>
<pre><code>localhost:mainpage_project davea$ python manage.py runstats
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you use a python env when you code in pycharm or the modules are installed for your global python ? Did you try to run <code>pip install django</code> in your terminal ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think I do use a virtual environment, at least in my main project directory I have a "venv" sub-directory.  Is that what you mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, then in this case you have 2 different instances of python the one in pycharm is using your venv with the django module installed, the one in your terminal is using system wide python without django installed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Running "source /bin/activate" did allow me to run my command in a terminal.  So if I wanted to set up a cron to run my command periodically, would I always have to run the "source /bin/activate" first before any "python manage.py command" command?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes! here is a reference for cron and virtualenvs: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3287063/1067213">stackoverflow.com/a/3287063/1067213</a></span>
