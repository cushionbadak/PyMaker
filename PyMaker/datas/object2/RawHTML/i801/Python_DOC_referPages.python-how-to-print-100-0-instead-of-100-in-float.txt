<p>I am solving a Python exercise about class:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Define a class called Bank that accepts the name you want associated
  with your bank account in a string, and a float that represents the
  amount of money in the account. The constructor should initialize two
  instance variables from those inputs: name and amt. Add a string
  method so that when you print an instance of Bank, you see “Your
  account, [name goes here], has [start_amt goes here] dollars.” Create
  an instance of this class with "Bob" as the name and 100.0 as the
  amount. Save this to the variable t1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wrote the following:</p>
<pre><code>class Bank:
def __init__(self, name, amt):
    self.name = name
    self.amt = amt

def __str__(self):
    return "Your account, {}, has {} dollars.".format(self.name, self.amt)

 t1 = Bank("Bob", 100.0)
 print(t1)
</code></pre>
<p>And the result I get is "<code>Your account, Bob, has 100 dollars.</code>" </p>
<p>But the correct answer is "<code>Your account, Bob, has 100.0 dollars.</code>"</p>
<p>How can I do to fix it? Thank you!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can change your <code>format</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def __str__(self):
    return "Your account, {0}, has {1:.1f} dollars.".format(self.name, self.amt)
</code></pre>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language" rel="noreferrer">Format Specification Mini-Language</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Or <em>hack</em> it:</p>
<pre><code>return "Your account, {}, has {}.0 dollars.".format(self.name, self.amt)
</code></pre>
<p>Or use <code>float</code>:</p>
<pre><code>return "Your account, {}, has {} dollars.".format(self.name, float(self.amt))
</code></pre>
