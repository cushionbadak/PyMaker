<p>In <strong>init</strong> method in a class I want to read keys as self.key from a dict kwarg and assign values to them. Look at code to understand.</p>
<pre><code>class Abc:
    def __init__(self,**kwarg):
        for key,value in kwarg.items():
            self.key = value
obj = class(name = 'josh', age = 23, country = 'UK')
print(dir(obj))
</code></pre>
<p>obj has only key attribute. I get it why it has key. But I don't know how to read keys to self.key? I think you can get the question.
What I except is obj must have name, age, country attributes</p>
