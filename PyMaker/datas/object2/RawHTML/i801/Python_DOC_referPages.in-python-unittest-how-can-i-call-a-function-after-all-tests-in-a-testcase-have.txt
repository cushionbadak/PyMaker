<p>Im running some unittests in Python and would like to call a function after all of the test cases have been run. </p>
<pre><code>class MyTestCase(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.credentials = credentials

    def tearDown(self):
        print("finished running " + self._testMethodName)

    def tearDownModule(self):
        print("finished running all tests")

    def test_1(self):
        #do something

    def test_2(self):
        #do something else
</code></pre>
<p>setUp and tearDown are running before and after each individual test. Yet i would like to call a function after all tests are finished running (in this case test_1 and test_2). </p>
<p>From the documentation looks like the tearDownModule() function should do it, yet this doesnt seem to be called. </p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#setupmodule-and-teardownmodule" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tearDownModule</code></a> is for use on the module scope, not as a method.  Instead, you probably want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.tearDownClass" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tearDownClass</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>class MyTestCase(TestCase):

    @classmethod
    def tearDownClass(cls):
        ...

<span class="comment-copy">You mean <code>def teardown_class</code>??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I actually tried this but forgot the decorator! Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can i pass 'self' into this function? Basically i need to access a variable which i'm updating in every tearDown call.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, you shouldn't.  It's best to avoid any mutable state between test units.</span>
