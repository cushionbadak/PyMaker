<p>I'm setting up a small python age system which would ask user to enter his age, and the system should pick a group for user age. For exmpl. If user writes 19 He would be in "Started Niqa" group. I would like to ask what should i use? Float, int, input, number for age and numbers? What does float, int, input used for? I'm new to python, and i would like to learn something new.
P.S You could add some basic sites for me to read. :) I'm using ATOM Editor, Python 3.

<h1>Age types</h1>
<pre><code>age = input("Please enter your age.")

if age &lt;= 18:

    age_group = 'Young Niqa'

elif (age &gt;= 18) and (age &lt;= 21):

    age_group = 'Starter Niqa'

elif (age &gt;= 21) and (age &lt;= 40):

    age_group = 'Experienced Niqa'

elif (age &gt;= 40) and (age &lt;= 100)

age_group = 'Professionall Niqa'

elif(age &lt;= 100) and (age &lt;= 9999)

age_group = 'Dead Niqa'

print(str(name) + "Your age group is -" + age_group)

<p>Invalid Syntax error.</p>

<p>You may want to read up on the basics of different data types in Python and programming languages in general, particularly the difference between <code>float</code> and <code>int</code>.  In short though, <code>int</code> means an integer, whereas floats are non-integer numbers.  Unless you're dealing with a kid who says stuff like "I'm seven and a half!", then people typically give their ages as integers.</p>
<p>Note however that <code>input</code> returns a string typed by the user.  So even if the user typed <code>7</code>, that comes back as the string <code>7</code>, not the integer.  You need to convert the string to an integer.</p>
<pre><code>age = input("Please enter your age: ")

age = int(age)

if age &lt;= 18:
    age_group = 'Young Niqa'
elif (age &gt; 18) and (age &lt;= 21):
    age_group = 'Starter Niqa'
elif (age &gt; 21) and (age &lt; 40):
    age_group = 'Experienced Niqa'
elif (age &gt;= 40) and (age &lt; 100):
    age_group = 'Professional Niqa'
elif(age &gt;= 100) and (age &lt;= 9999):
    age_group = 'Dead Niqa'

print("Your age group is: " + age_group)
</code></pre>
<p>Some other problems I fixed in your code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two of your <code>elif</code>s were missing colons</li>
<li>They also had bad indentation</li>
<li>...and one spelling error</li>
<li><code>&lt;= 100</code> should be <code>&gt;= 100</code></li>
<li>And although this isn't a bug, you have some ages belonging to more than one group.  In these cases, the first match is the one taken, with the rest ignored.  Still, I changed some "&lt;=" and "&gt;=" to "&lt;" and "&gt;".</li>
</ul>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Most of the programming languages like C, C++, Java use braces { } to define a block of code. Python uses indentation.</p>
<p>A code block (body of a function, loop etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation is up to you, but it must be consistent throughout that block.</p>
<p>As @koralp mentioned, your last 2 elif statements are not properly indented. They should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>age = input("Please enter your age.")

if age &lt;= 18:

    age_group = 'Young Niqa'

elif (age &gt;= 18) and (age &lt;= 21):

    age_group = 'Starter Niqa'

elif (age &gt;= 21) and (age &lt;= 40):

    age_group = 'Experienced Niqa'

elif (age &gt;= 40) and (age &lt;= 100):

    age_group = 'Professionall Niqa'

elif(age &lt;= 100) and (age &lt;= 9999):

    age_group = 'Dead Niqa'

print(str(name) + "Your age group is -" + age_group)

<span class="comment-copy">Last two <code>elif</code> statements are missing <code>:</code> and <i>indentation</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is identation? i put : and i still have error - expected an indented block</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a>  start here for resarch ... you can also read this page - there are plenty of ressources in it:  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/python/info">stackoverflow.com/tags/python/info</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">your conditions can be streamlined: <code>elif (age &gt;= 18) and (age &lt;= 21):</code>  can be written as <code>elif 18 &lt;= age &lt;= 21</code> ... and you can even omit the lower border. If the person would have been 18 or lower the <i>first</i> if already had taken action and this one would not be checked at all ... so <code>Ã¬f age &lt;19: ...elif age &lt; 22: ...elif age &lt; 41: .... </code> would be shorter and smarter</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks :)))))))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welcome!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But after writing the age, it shows some error: <a href="https://gyazo.com/f07e532a69b071152f61e610bdc7caca" rel="nofollow noreferrer">gyazo.com/f07e532a69b071152f61e610bdc7caca</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh thanks, it was my code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yep, that error you got is due to "age" still being a string in your code.  Adding the <code>age = int(age)</code> line, like the one I have here,should fix it.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@user9745220 on line 35 and 37 of your code. Can you give spaces in the beginning of the line to match with line 33.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I found out that problem was the lines, i need to put a space between the start of "Proffessionall niqa" and "Dead Niqa" elif.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user9745220 if it worked can you select my answer :)</span>
