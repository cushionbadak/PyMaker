<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to take input from the user for an ip address and want to print out the no.segments by extracting "."(dots) from the input and copying  that"."(dots) to new string and print out the length using python</p>
<pre><code>Ip_address = input('enter an ip address')
segment = ''
for i in range(0, len(Ip_address)):
    if Ip_address[i] in '.':
        print(Ip_address[i],end='')
        segment = segment+Ip_address[i]

print(segment)
print(len(segment))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Not sure if this is what you are asking. But you can use the split method.</p>
<pre><code>Ip_address = "192.168.1.1"
octets = Ip_address.split(".") #['192', '168', '1', '1']
print(len(octets))
</code></pre>
<p>then you can do whatever you want with the segments</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is your definition of <i>segment</i>? Your source code currently prints each dot in the ip address, and then print all dots (i.e. <b>always</b> print 6 dots given a proper ip address) and print 3, which, once again, <b>always</b> prints 3.</span>
