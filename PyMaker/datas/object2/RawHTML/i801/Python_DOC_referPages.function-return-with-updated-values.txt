<p>I was trying to sort list elements inside a function without return when I try to print the list by its name it does not get sorted, but it is sorted inside a function.</p>
<p>I have to update the list inside the function without returning</p>
<pre><code>def sort(n):
    n.append(10)
    sorted(n)
n = [5,1,2,3]
print(n)
</code></pre>
<p>Expected : <code>[1,2,3,5]</code>
actual: <code>[5,1,2,3]</code></p>
</div>

<p>I'm sorry, I made a series of mistakes myself. It's a lesson for me too.  </p>
<pre><code>def isort(n):
    n.append(10)
    n.sort()  #I used n[:] = sorted(n), but it's superfluous.

n = [5,1,2,3]
isort(n)
print(n)

m = [7,9,3,13]
isort(m)
print(m)
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3, 5, 10]
[3, 7, 9, 10, 13]
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>sort</code> is an existed fuction in python, need to change it to other name. I changed to <code>isort</code>.  </li>
<li>We have to call the function <code>isort</code> to let it do its work.</li>
<li>We need to update the elements in the list to make the list update. <code>[:]</code> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/509211/5403468">Slice notation</a> here.</li>
<li>It's better to use different name between function argument and the call. (<code>n</code> and <code>m</code> here).</li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to DYZ, Primusa, and Tomothy32 :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You didn't call your <code>sort</code> function. Nor is it clear why you are appending <code>10</code> when you don't <i>want</i> to append <code>10</code>. Also, <code>sorted</code> doesn't work in-place.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">once i called the function i have to update the list inside.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DYZ: It isn’t. Maybe you’re thinking of <code>list.sort</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, the question states "I have to update the list inside the function without returning"</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>sorted(n)</code> doesn't change <code>n</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not just <code>n.sort()</code> instead of <code>n[:] = sorted(n)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tomothy32  Yeah... that's right. just call it inside. Thanks again :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know, but I can't find <code>sort</code>: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html</a>. I'm sure it's not a built-in, but instead a member of <code>list</code>.</span>
