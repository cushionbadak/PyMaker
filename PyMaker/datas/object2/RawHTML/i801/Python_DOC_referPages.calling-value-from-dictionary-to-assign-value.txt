<p>I want to be able to call from this dictionary, from input() below, and assign cost accordingly to colorCost. I cannot figure out the correct way to call from color_dict based on input().</p>
<pre><code>Color = input()
print('Choose a color: ')
colorCost = 
print('Cost of', Color, ': $', colorCost)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try the below snippet</p>
<pre><code>colorCost = color_dict[Color]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You probably want <code>colorCost = color_dict[Color]</code> though you have your input and first print statement backwards. This is a question about Python's basics, so you should spend time going through a Python tutorial. Is there something about Python's dictionaries in your tutorial that you do not understand?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You call by their keys. What you should do: colorCost = color_dict[Color]</span>
