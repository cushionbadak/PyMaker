<p>I'm going to fetch all the filenames and locations in the particular sub directory (if fit the pattern). These sub directories are located in the different locations with different depth (as it was discussed: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54011734/how-to-get-all-the-files-from-multiple-folders-with-the-same-names/54012093#54012093">how to get all the files from multiple folders with the same names</a>). </p>
<p>My problem: asap I find 'xyz' in the directory , I don't want to check if 'xyz' is a sub directory for any other directories on the same level (for an example, I don't want to check if 'D:/qwer/lkj' may contain 'xyz'.</p>
<pre><code>D:/qwer/xyz
D:/qwerty/qwertyui/xyz
D:/qwerty/zxc/zxc1/zxcv12/zx/xyz
</code></pre>
<p>The code:</p>
<pre><code>for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(path_to_main_search = 'D:\\'):
    if 'xyz' in dirpath:
      filenames = [fn for fn in filenames if fnmatch.fnmatch(fn, pattern)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can remove all directory names other than <code>'xyz'</code> from <code>dirnames</code> in-place so that they will not be traversed:</p>
<pre><code>for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(path_to_main_search):
    if 'xyz' in dirnames:
        dirnames[:] = ['xyz']
    if os.path.basename(dirpath) == 'xyz':
        # process filenames
</code></pre>
<p>Excerpt from <code>os.walk</code>'s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When <code>topdown</code> is <code>True</code>, the caller can modify the <code>dirnames</code> list in-place
  (perhaps using <code>del</code> or slice assignment), and <code>walk()</code> will only recurse
  into the subdirectories whose names remain in <code>dirnames</code>; this can be
  used to prune the search, impose a specific order of visiting, or even
  to inform <code>walk()</code> about directories the caller creates or renames
  before it resumes <code>walk()</code> again.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">do you want to check D:/qwerty/qwertyui/xyz for other things after finding D:/qwer/xyz ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, I want to continue search in D:/qwerty/ . For and example,  even if there were /qwerty/qwertyui2, and /qwerty/qwertyui3 i need to go there too. If 'xyz' are in /qwerty/qwertyui2 I want to find it too, but don't need to go to D:/qwerty/qwertyui/new/xyz</span>
