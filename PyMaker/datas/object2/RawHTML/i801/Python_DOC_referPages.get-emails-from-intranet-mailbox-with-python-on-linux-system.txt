<p>I am able to access emails from company intranet mailbox 'ABCName.company.com' with my credentials username and password within outlook on my local system by setting it as different account.</p>
<p>Also, I am able to get automated emails with python code as below:</p>
<pre><code>outlook = win32com.client.Dispatch("Outlook.Application").GetNamespace("MAPI")
folder_inbox = outlook.Folders("ABCName").Folders("Inbox")
messages = folder_inbox.Items
message = messages.GetFirst()
</code></pre>
<p>How can I connect to same ABCName mailbox from linux server with my credentials to get the emails? Linux server do not have outlook setup.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That code isn't connecting to a mail server. Outlook is a client-side email application that connects to a mail server and downloads messages using some protocol - IMAP, POP3, MAPI, etc. That code is simply reading the messages from the Outlook profile, which were already pulled off the server. Be aware that this code will not work on any other machines - including other Windows machines - without Outlook installed and configured for "ABCName" account. </p>
<p>Python runs on Windows and Linux, so assuming the script is configured correctly, it should run on either regardless of OS. You need an application that can read from a mail server, not a client-side email application. The modules you implement depend on protocols supported by the mail server. </p>
<p>For POP3, you can uses poplib:</p>

<p>For IMAP, you can use imaplib:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You're aware what the code you've got there is actually doing, right? That it's utilizing built-in function in the OS and software to communicate with its own product? What you're looking for is probably the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">imap</a> library. There is no other way to do this, unless you run outlook via Wine and python in Wine as well. Or just a virtual machine and communicate via <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/articles/os-python-kvm-scripting1/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">libvirt</a> or <a href="https://negotiator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">kvm</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Davis for reply. Can you please guide me towards minimum example to connect via imap- like where do I give mailbox name and its folder name? On your mentioned link for imap example is: import getpass, imaplib M = imaplib.IMAP4() M.login(getpass.getuser(), getpass.getpass()) M.select() typ, data = M.search(None, 'ALL') for num in data[0].split():     typ, data = M.fetch(num, '(RFC822)')     print 'Message %s\n%s\n' % (num, data[0][1]) M.close() M.logout()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This page has a lot of good information for the imaplib: <a href="https://pymotw.com/2/imaplib/#listing-mailboxes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pymotw.com/2/imaplib/#listing-mailboxes</a></span>
