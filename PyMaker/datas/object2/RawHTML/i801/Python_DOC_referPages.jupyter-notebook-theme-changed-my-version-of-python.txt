<p>I just changed my theme in jupyter notebook. However even though it's showing python 3. I input() does not work. Only raw_input().</p>

<p>You should install <a href="https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/kernel_install.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ipykernel</a> to manage multiple version of Python in Jupyter Notebook. Alternatively you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">venv</a></p>
