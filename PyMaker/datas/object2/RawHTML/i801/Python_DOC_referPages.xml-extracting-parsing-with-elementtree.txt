<p>I am trying to parse some XML data from this url: <a href="http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.xml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.xml</a> , return the Count value and sum the extracted values. </p>
<pre><code>import urllib as ur
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

url = input(('Enter location: '))
print'Retrieving:', url

data = ur.urlopen(url).read()
tree = ET.fromstring(data)
counts = tree.findall('.//count')

print('Count: ', sum(counts))
#print('Sum: ', sum_all)
</code></pre>
<p>I understand there is some basic issue here, but I've been trying and failing to amend my code without success. I am receiving a TypeError as follows: </p>
<pre><code>Enter location: 'http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.xml'
Retrieving: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.xml
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "extracting_xml.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    print('Count: ', sum(counts))
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'Element'

<p>The error you are getting is in the summation <code>sum(counts)</code>. Instead you should do:</p>
<pre><code>sum([int(el.text) for el in counts])
</code></pre>
<p>As the exception indicates you are trying to sum up found nodes of type <code>Element</code> which do not have addition operator defined. The nodes contain plain integers so converting the text of the node to <code>int</code> and then summing up is what you need to do.</p>
<p>Should you have floats in your nodes then you would use <code>float</code> constructor.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">perfect, thank you! just so I can make sure I understand, this amendment is 1. converting elements to integers 2. for the elements in counts?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Converting <code>text</code> value of object of type <code>Element</code> to <code>int</code>. In this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a> it is variable <code>el</code>.</span>
