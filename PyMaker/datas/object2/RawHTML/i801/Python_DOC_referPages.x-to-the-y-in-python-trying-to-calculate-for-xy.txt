<p>Obviously I am new to programming and Python so I am trying to learn.  Here is my question below I am trying to answer:</p>
<p>“We will pass in 2 values, X and Y. You should calculate X^y and output the final result”  what you see below is what I was provided.  I believe I am to use a nested loop to calculate it. </p>
<pre><code>import sys
X = int(sys.argv[1])
Y = int(sys.argv[2])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try <code>X ** Y</code>, unless you have some other requirement (like writing it by hand).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also use function for powering:</p>
<pre><code> math.pow(x, y)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To raise X to the Y in python, you want to use the exponentiation <code>**</code> operator:
this should do it:
<em>in terminal:</em></p>
<p>python</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5**4
&gt;&gt;&gt; 625
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">what is the error message?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When asking about code that produces an Exception you should always include the complete Traceback in the question. Copy the Traceback and paste it in the question, then format it as code (select it and type ctrl-k)</span>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>...I get an error.</code> you need to be specific about how/why your solution is deficient.
