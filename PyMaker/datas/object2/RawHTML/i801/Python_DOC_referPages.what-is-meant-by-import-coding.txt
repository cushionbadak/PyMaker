<p>I am working with <code>elffile</code> python module/library. There is one line of code that is giving the following error</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "elffile.py", line 36, in &lt;module&gt;
    import coding
ImportError: No module named coding
</code></pre>
<p>I could not find any python file or class named <code>coding</code>. Also, I didn't find anything on the internet regarding <code>import coding</code>.</p>

<p>Import is when you import modules to use in your coding.</p>
<p>If it cant find the module you probably have to install it. The easiest way to do this is to use pip.</p>
<p>Write: pip install coding (or pip3) and it will install the module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It means import the coding module. That's not part of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">standard library</a>, you probably need to install it: <code>pip install coding</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, @jonrsharpe. It worked for me.</span>
