<p>How do I make a specific line of code execute only once inside a while loop?</p>
<p>I want the line:
 <code>"Hello %s, please enter your guess: " %p1"</code> to run only once and not every time the player guesses wrong. </p>
<p>Is there are command or function I can use or do I have to structure the whole game differently? Is there a simple fix to the program in this form?</p>
<pre><code>import random

number = random.randint(1,9)

p1 = input("Please enter your name: ")

count = 0

guess = 0

while guess != number and guess != "exit":

    guess = input("Hello %s, please enter your guess: " % p1)

    if guess == "exit":
        break

    guess = int(guess)
    count += 1

    if guess == number:
        print("Correct! It Took you only", count, "tries. :)")
        break
    elif guess &gt; number:
        print("Too high. Try again.")
    elif guess &lt; number:
        print("Too low. Try again.")
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You <em>have to</em> ask for a new <code>guess</code> on every iteration - else the code will loop either endlessly (after first wrong guess) or finish immediately.</p>
<p>To change up the message you can use a ternary (aka: inline <code>if</code> statement) inside your print to make it conditional:</p>
<pre><code># [start identical]

while guess != number and guess != "exit": 
    guess = input("Hello {}, please enter your guess: ".format(p1) if count == 0 
                  else "Try again: ")

# [rest identical]
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/394809/does-python-have-a-ternary-conditional-operator">Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?</a></p>
<p>The ternary checks the <code>count</code> variable that you increment and prints one message if it is <code>0</code> and on consecutive runs the other text (because <code>count</code> is no longer <code>0</code>).</p>
<p>You might want to switch to more modern forms of string formatting as well: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.format</code> - works for 2.7 as well</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can create a flag variable, e. g. </p>
<pre><code>print_username = True
</code></pre>
<p>before the while loop. Inside the loop uncheck it after loop's first iteration:</p>
<pre><code>if print_username:
    guess = input("Hello %s, please enter your guess: " % p1)
    print_username = False
else:
    guess = input("Try a new guess:")
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A way to execute an instruction only x times in a while loop could be to implement a counter, and add an if condition that checks if the counter &lt; x before executing the instruction. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should ask for the username outside of the loop and request input at the beginning of the loop. </p>
<p>Inside the loop you create output at the end and request input on the next iteration. The same would work for the first iteration: create output (outside of the loop) and then request input (first thing inside the loop)</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">ternary is shorter - and <code>count</code> already works as discriminator - no need to create another flag. This is "easier" though.</span>
