<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've just started learning a bit of Python and I'm currently trying to implement a Python UI through HTML. Is there anything in vanilla Python that would allow for this, similar to how you can create UI's with Java and XML with JFX or will I have to use a framework such as Django? </p>
<p>I'm reluctant to use Django as there are many features that I do not need</p>
<p>Thanks,<br/>

<p>In vanilla python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/wsgiref.html" rel="nofollow">wsgiref</a> is very helpful for building the server-side of web-applications (possibly with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow">str.format</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#template-strings" rel="nofollow">string.Template</a> and/or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">json</a>) but if you want it more direct communication I would suggest <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.html" rel="nofollow">XML-RPC</a> (there are good js-clients out there).</p>
<p>It is also possible to execute Python Scripts right in your Website with <a href="http://www.brython.info/" rel="nofollow">Brython</a> or (with strong constraints) <a href="http://ironpython.net/" rel="nofollow">Ironpython</a></p>
<p>For Windows you can build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application" rel="nofollow">HTML Applications</a> with <a href="http://ironpython.net/" rel="nofollow">Ironpython</a> (have not tried but in theory it should work) or <a href="http://www.brython.info/" rel="nofollow">Brython</a> (if you dont want to require the user to have ironpython installed)</p>
<p>You can also use <a href="http://pyjs.org/" rel="nofollow">Pyjs</a> to build applications but while it uses html and javascript, i think it you dont see much of it.</p>
<p>There are HTML things in some ui-libraries like in <a href="https://wxpython.org/" rel="nofollow">wxpython</a> (I am quite sure you will find them in many libraries)</p>
