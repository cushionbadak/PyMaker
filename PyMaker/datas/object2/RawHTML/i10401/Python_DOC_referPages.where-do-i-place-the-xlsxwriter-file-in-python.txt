<p>I downloaded XlsxWriter zip file as I cannot use pip because of organisational restrictions. I extracted the zip file. Where inside the python directory should I place the XlsxWriter folder now ?</p>

<p>For most of the cases use <code>pip</code> to install Python modules. It is very easy.</p>
<p>Just do:</p>
<pre><code>pip install XlsxWriter
</code></pre>
<p>And then in your script you can do the following:</p>
<pre><code>import xlsxwriter

{...your code goes here}
</code></pre>
<p>If somehow you are not able to use pip, please follow <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-install-Python-packages-on-Windows-7/" rel="nofollow">this</a></p>
<p>After that close and re-open your IDLE and check.</p>
