<p>I need to open a thread whose target is defined in a different file.</p>
<p>I would like to pass the target name through a string containing, of course, the name of the function I want to run on thread.
Is that impossible, or am I missing something? </p>
<p>For instance, here is my code:</p>
<p>Here is the code that has the target function:</p>
<pre><code># command.py

def hello():
    print("hello world")
</code></pre>
<p>and here is the code I will run:</p>
<pre><code># run.py

import threading
import commands

funcname = "hello"

thread1 = threading.Thread(target= ... , daemon=True)
thread1.start()
</code></pre>
<p>What do i need to put as target?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread" rel="nofollow">python docs</a> the <code>target</code> has to be a callable object. From your example you should be able to just put </p>
<p><code>target=command.hello</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, but how do I "extract" the callable object hello from the string funcname?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3061/calling-a-function-of-a-module-from-a-string-with-the-functions-name-in-python">see this issue on StackOverflow</a>  You can do it like <code>getattr(commands, funcname)()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">or like <code>thread1 = threading.Thread(target=getattr(commands, funcname), ...)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That worked like a charm, thanks dude!</span>
