<p>Sorry if this is somewhere out there but I just couldn't find a solution to what I was looking for. I want to return the value of my dictionary without the quotations and can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.</p>
<pre><code>def read_wiktionary():
 answer = dict()
 f = open('wiktionary.txt', 'r')
 for line in f:
      word,value = line.rstrip('\n').split(' ')
      answer[word] = (value)
 return answer
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The quotation is just used as a separator between different keys and values so it cannot be removed.The quotation doesn't affect your values in the dictionary.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you read a file, everything is read as a string. To get a float value, you'll need to cast it to a float.</p>
<pre><code>def read_wiktionary():
    answer = dict()
    f = open('wiktionary.txt', 'r')
    for line in f:
        word, value = line.rstrip('\n').split(' ')
        answer[word] = float(value)
    return answer
</code></pre>
<p>As an aside, it's generally good practice to use <code>with</code> to open a file so that it will automatically be closed when it exits the block. From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file
  objects. This has the advantage that the file is properly closed after
  its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised on the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I would suggest:</p>
<pre><code>def read_wiktionary():
    answer = {}
    with open('wiktionary.txt', 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            word, value = line.rstrip('\n').split(' ')
            answer[word] = float(value)
    return answer
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you give an example of your expected output? Its difficult to be sure what you mean when you say without quotations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you print a string value, it usually prints with quotations to indicate it's a string. The actual value of the string doesn't contain those quotes. Can you clarify what you need <code>answer</code> for and what isn't working?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">&gt;&gt;&gt; freq = read_wiktionary() &gt;&gt;&gt; freq['the'] 56271872.0 &gt;&gt;&gt; freq['my'] 3277699.0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It should output like the above output, I'm getting the same outputs but with quotations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right Karin, but i am trying to return a dictionary value. Which I assumed would not return as a string.</span>
