<p>There is a <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/compare/compare.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">compare</a> package in R which contains a function of the same name, that compares two datasets under several aspects. So you can set different arguments to the <code>compare()</code> function and so define, which deviation of df2 from df1 should be accepted. So if you two equal datasets, but the one is longer because of covering a larger time period, so you can set <code>short=TRUE</code>.
The whole list of possible arguments is:</p>
<pre><code>compare(model, comparison,
        equal = TRUE,
        coerce = allowAll,
        shorten = allowAll,
        ignoreOrder = allowAll,
        ignoreNameCase = allowAll,
        ignoreNames = allowAll,
        ignoreAttrs = allowAll,
        round = FALSE,
        ignoreCase = allowAll,
        trim = allowAll,
        dropLevels = allowAll,
        ignoreLevelOrder = allowAll,
        ignoreDimOrder = allowAll,
        ignoreColOrder = allowAll,
        ignoreComponentOrder = allowAll,
        colsOnly = !allowAll,
        allowAll = FALSE)
</code></pre>
<p>I am wondering if Python has a similar package? So I need one function / package that can handle different cases of difference &amp; equality of two datasets. I didn't found an analogue two the compare function from R yet.</p>
<p>The most similar to compare from what I have found is <code>assert_frame_equal(df, expected, check_names=False)</code> function, which is not as broad as compare().</p>

<p>Well after months of working with Python I can present the answer to own question.</p>
<p>For comparing <strong>two arrays</strong> use functions from <strong>numpy</strong> package.</p>
<pre><code>numpy.array_equal(array1,array2)  # test if the same shape and values
numpy.array_equiv(array1,array2)  # test if shape consistent and all elements equal
numpy.allclose(array1,array2) # test if same shape, elements have close values
</code></pre>
<p>Documentation of these functions can be found <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>That's now what I needed, but maybe it can be hepful for somebody: 
for comparing <strong>two sequences of text</strong> use <strong>difflib</strong> package, which helps to compare HTML, .txt files etc. Documentation can be read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
