<p>I know 2 is a prime number, but when this code is ran it doesn't match the if statement condition <code>if n % x == 0</code>. but <code>2 % 2 == 0</code> so it should be a equal:    </p>
<pre><code>for n in range(2, 10):
    for x in range(2, n):
        if n % x == 0:
           print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
           break
    else:
    # loop fell through without finding a factor
         print(n, 'is a prime number')

<p>From the Python documentation of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-range" rel="nofollow"><code>range()</code></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a positive <em>step</em>, the contents of a range <code>r</code> are determined by the formula <code>r[i] = start + step*i</code> where <code>i &gt;= 0</code> and <code>r[i] &lt; stop</code>.</p>
<p>A range object will be empty if <code>r[0]</code> does not meet the value constraint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when <code>n = 2</code>, <code>range(2, n)</code> is an empty range, because <code>r[0]</code> is <code>2</code> and that doesn't meet the constraint <code>2 &lt; 2</code>. Therefore <code>for</code> loop never runs, so it never breaks, and as a result, the <code>else:</code> block is executed and reports that it's prime.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@AndrewL.It's <i>ironic</i> that you're posting a link to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops" rel="nofollow noreferrer">same place where the OP got the code</a> for his/her question :-) Which the OP should have mentioned.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What makes you think it ever tests <code>2 % 2</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KevinJ.Chase well at the time i thought that n was the  iteration from 2 to 9 in for x in range(2,n) and x = 2 and n = 2 would be excuted in the if statement condition</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The second parameter is called "stop" and the value used here is n. So I'd say it does stop at n. And since this is about Python 3, <code>range(2, n)</code> is not a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StefanPochmann I reworded it.</span>
