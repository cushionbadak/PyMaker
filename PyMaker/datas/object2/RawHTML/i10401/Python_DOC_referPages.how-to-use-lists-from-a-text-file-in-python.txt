<p>i have been trying to read/write values(lists) in a .txt file and using them later, but i can't find a function or something to help me use these values as lists and not strings, since using the <code>readline</code> function doesn't help.</p>
<p>Also, im don't want to use multiple text files to make up 1 list</p>
<p>example:</p>
<pre><code>v=[]
f = open("test.txt","r+",-1)
f.seek(0)
v.append(f.readline())
print(v)
</code></pre>
<p>in test.txt</p>
<pre><code>cat, dog, dinosaur, elephant
cheese, hotdog, pizza, sushi
101, 23, 58, 23
</code></pre>
<p>im expecting to the list <code>v = [cat, dog, dinosaur, elephant]</code> in separate indexes, but by doing this code (which is totally wrong) i get this instead
<code>v = ['cat,dog,dinosaur,elephant']</code> which is what i don't want</p>

<p>Sounds like you want to read it as comma separated values.</p>
<p>Try the following</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open('test.txt', newline='') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
</code></pre>
<p>I believe that will put you on the right track. For more information about how the csv parser works, have a look at the docs</p>

<p>To me, it looks like you're trying to read a file, and split it by <code>,</code>.<br/>
This can be accomplished by</p>
<pre><code>f = open("test.txt", "r+").read()
v = f.split(",")
print(v)
</code></pre>
<p>It should output</p>
<blockquote>
<p>['cat', ' dog', ' dinosaur', ' elephant\ncheese', ...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so forth.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I had no idea about CSV when i made this question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hey this works, altough, would this csv apply for another separation method? like <code>:</code> <code>;</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sure, just pop in the delimiter you want in the reader function, for example csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=':') to use : as a seperator</span>
<span class="comment-copy">after further testing and reading, i'm interested in how do i select 1 single row? or shouls i transform the <code>print(row)</code> into <code>v.append(row)</code> and thus select the desired list using <code>v[0]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tested this, it kinda works, but for some values it prints the <code>"</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aozyk And by <code>"</code> you mean...?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">character <code>"</code>, it looks like this <code>['cat,dog,dinosaur,elephant ...]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It would only do that if you had the <code>'</code> character inside your file. Do you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i just had something else typed, sorry :p, but it wasn't on the file.</span>
