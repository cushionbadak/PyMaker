<p>How do I check if a function b() is being called by a method?</p>
<pre><code>class hello():
    delete():
        b()
</code></pre>
<p>I want to use mock in a unit test.</p>

<p>If you are just looking for a way to mock objects <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> is probably the best way to do it.</p>
<p>To answer the first part of your question, there is indeed a way to get information about the caller function. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2529859/get-parent-function">This</a> might help you</p>

<p>Assuming you have a test environment you can in fire up the python(or the Ipython) shell and use the debugger to call the function:</p>
<p>if this is your function </p>
<pre><code>def multiplier(a,b):
    print a*b
</code></pre>
<p>then you can do this in the shell and debug the code:</p>
<pre><code>import ipdb
ipdb.runcall(multiplier, 10, 10)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What are your constraints? Can you modify <code>b</code>? Or monkeypatch it? Are you in fact asking aboud <a href="https://docs.python.org/devguide/coverage.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">coverage</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I can't modify b, I just need to check to see if its called when hello() is called with specific arguments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you read through the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">unittest.mock</a> documentation to see how to go about doing this? There are also several examples on how to mock methods and check if they are being called. If you have attempted this already, please share your code to help guide you in the right direction.</span>
