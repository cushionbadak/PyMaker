<p>(I'm a Python newbie, so apologies for this basic question, I for some reason couldn't find an answer to.)</p>
<p>I have a nested <code>if</code> statement with the <code>if</code> statement of an <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> block. In the <em>nested</em> <code>if</code> statement, if it it meets the criteria, I'd like the code to break to the <code>else</code> statement. When I put a <code>break</code> in the nested <code>if</code>, though, I'm not sure if it's breaking to the <code>else</code> statement.</p>
<p>I'd like to find the longest substring in alphabetical order of a given string, <code>s</code>. Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>s = 'lugabcdeczsswabcdefghij'
longest = 1
alpha_count = 1
longest_temp = 1
longest_end = 1
for i in range(len(s)-1):
    if (s[i] &lt;= s[i+1]):
        alpha_count += 1
        if (i+1 == (len(s)-1)):
            break
    else:
        longest_check = alpha_count
        if longest_check &gt; longest:
            longest = longest_check
            longest_end = i+1
        alpha_count = 1
print(longest)
print('Longest substring in alphabetical order is: ' + 
    s[(longest_end-longest):longest_end])
</code></pre>
<p>(Yes, I realize there's surely lots of unnecessary code here. Still learning!)</p>
<p>At this nested <code>if</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if (i+1 == (len(s)-1)):
            break
</code></pre>
<p>...if <code>True</code>, I'd like the code to break to the <code>else</code> statement. It doesn't seem to break to that section, though. Any help?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>break</code> is used when you want to break out of loops not if statments. You can have another <code>if</code> statement that executes this logic for you like this:</p>
<pre><code>if (s[i] &lt;= s[i+1]):
    alpha_count += 1
elif (i+1 == (len(s)-1)) or (add boolean expression for else part in here too something like s[i] &gt; s[i+1]):
    longest_check = alpha_count
    if longest_check &gt; longest:
        longest = longest_check
        longest_end = i+1
    alpha_count = 1
</code></pre>
<p>What this snippet is doing is evaluating two booleans, both are for the <code>else</code> part. However, it says either execute in case of <code>else</code> from first <code>if</code> or in case of <code>(i+1 == (len(s)-1))</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">break is used in loop statements.  I think you want to use flags.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>break</code> statement is only use to break from while and for loops: see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break</a> What are you wanting ? A way to go to the else block if you encounter your current break ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@XavierC.Yes, that's exactly what I want. If I encounter the current break, I'd like to go to the else block I have written.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe the first if statement should have an and boolean as well: if (s[i] &lt;= s[i+1]) and (i+1 &lt; (len(s)-1)):         alpha_count += 1     elif (s[i] &lt;= s[i+1]) and (i+1 == (len(s)-1)):</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you want the first one to execute whenever <code>i + 1 &lt; (len(s) - 1)</code></span>
