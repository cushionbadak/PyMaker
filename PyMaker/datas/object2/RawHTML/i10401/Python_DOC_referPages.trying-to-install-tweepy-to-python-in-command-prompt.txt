<p>So I have recently installed Python Version 2.7.5 and I have made a little loop thing with it but the problem is, when I go to cmd and type <code>python testloop.py</code> I get the error: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have tried setting the path but no avail.</p>
<p>Here is my path:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:\Program Files\Python27</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, this is where my Python is installed. I don't know what else to do. Can someone help?</p>

<p>You need to add that folder to your Windows Path:</p>

<p>Try "py" instead of "python" from command line:</p>

<p>I have found the answer... click on the installer and check the box "Add python to environment variables" DO NOT uninstall the old one rather click on modify....Click on link for picture...</p>

<p>Firstly, be sure where your python directory. It is normally in <code>C:\Python27</code>. If yours is different then change it from the below command.</p>
<p>If after you install it python still isn’t recognized, then in PowerShell enter this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27",
  "User")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Close PowerShell and then start it again to make sure Python now runs. If it doesn’t,
restart may be required.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Type py -v instead of python -v in command prompt</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to see python version then you should use <code>py -V</code> instead of <code>python -V</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:\Users\ghasan&gt;py -V</p>
<p>Python 3.7.1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to go to python's running environment then you should use <code>py</code> instead of <code>python</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:\Users\ghasan&gt;py</p>
<p>Python 3.7.1 (v3.7.1:260ec2c36a, Oct 20 2018, 14:57:15) [MSC v.1915 64
  bit (AMD64)] on win32</p>
<p>Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here you can run the python program as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>print('Hello Python')</p>
<p>Hello Python</p>

<p>i solved this by running CMD in administration mode, so try this.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have met same issue when I install Python, and it is resolved when I set a PATH in system, here are the steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to "Control Panel" -&gt; "System"</li>
<li>Click "Advanced system settings" on the left</li>
<li>Click "Environment Variables"</li>
<li>Search and click "Path" variable</li>
<li>Click "Edit"</li>
<li>Add "C:\"to the environment variables field, if you are using Windows7, then separate it by a semicolon from the existing entry. If you are using Windows10, just simply click "New" to add.</li>
<li>Reopen the Command Prompt and try

</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From the Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows" rel="nofollow">docs</a>, set the PATH like you did as above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should arrange for Python’s installation directory to be added to the PATH of every command window as it starts. If you installed Python fairly recently then the command dir C:\py* will probably tell you where it is installed; the usual location is something like C:\Python27. Otherwise you will be reduced to a search of your whole disk  </p>
<p>Use Tools ‣ Find or hit the Search button and look for “python.exe”. Supposing you discover that Python is installed in the C:\Python27 directory (the default at the time of writing), you should make sure that entering the command</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then execute the Python command using the full path name to make sure that works.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Another helpful but simple solution might be restarting your computer after doing the download if Python is in the PATH variable. This has been a mistake I usually make when downloading Python onto a new machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just find out where you have these three files in your system then copy each path and paste it in environment variable one by one. Then click ok to all.</p>
<p>C:\Anaconda3</p>
<p>C:\Anaconda3\Scripts </p>
<p>C:\Anaconda3\Library\bin </p>
<p>Then Restart your Spyder kernel(left hand side) and type python in cmd to check if it is working.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Open CMD with administrative access(Right click then run as administrator) then type the following command there:</p>
<pre><code>set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\My_python_lib
</code></pre>
<p>Replace My_python_lib with the folder name of your installed python like for me it was <code>C:\python27</code>.
Then to check if the path variable is set, type <code>echo %PATH%</code> you'll see your python part in the end. Hence now <code>python</code> is accessible.

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks but I fixed it by deleting program files :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Link broken. Do you maybe have a new one?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For Python 3, here it is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Confirmed installed python 3.4.2 recently. py command is registered automatically.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Works! Why python is no good though a lot of sources say it should be used?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">odd that <code>py</code> is setup automatically... yet not <code>python</code> ? dafaq? Oh but this answer kind of explains <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32742093/how-to-access-python-from-command-line-using-py-instead-of-python#answer-32742619" title="how to access python from command line using py instead of python%23answer 32742619">stackoverflow.com/questions/32742093/…</a> - basically <code>py</code> allows you to specify what version of python you want, but f you don't specify anything then it chooses the default</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah.. same question.. py works for python 3.5.2 but python doesnt work. my environmetal variables are set correctly. Any reason why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">finally it worked after spending an hour on this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I understand this is not the place to thank anyone but I was trying to solve the problem for the past 2 days. Thankyou!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">worked perfectly!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Worked for me also, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Balle balle! You rock. This worked fantastically. I had to restart Powershell and Command Prompt to see the effect.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, this helped me add Python 2.7 as "python" (already able to start Python 3 with "py").</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks man this is the correct solution and it worked for me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can also use SETX PATH "PATHLOCATION OF TOOL" in CMD. e.g.   SETX PATH "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In sixth step, you should say Add "C:\Python34" or "C:\Python27", it is depended by the version of your python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Question does not mention Anaconda!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I faced the same error so I gave the solution which worked for me. Just consider the required path (!!)</span>
