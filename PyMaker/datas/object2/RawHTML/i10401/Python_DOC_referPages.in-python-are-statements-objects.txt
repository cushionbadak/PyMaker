<p>As far as I understand, everything in python is an object or a reference. 
For example: in <code>x = 1</code>, <code>x</code> is a reference to the integer object <code>1</code>. If I write <code>print type(x)</code>, then Python will tell me the object that x is referencing is an integer. </p>
<p>So what about statements such as <code>if</code>?</p>
<p>if I try <code>print type(if)</code>, unsurprisingly, I get a syntax error. I can speculate on why this is the case. Maybe <code>if</code> is a static method of a class, or maybe it has somehow been weirdly defined as non returnable, etc. I just don't know.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I suspect that <code>if</code> has nothing to do with an object or a reference. However, that would surely go against the idea of everything being an object or a reference?    </p>

<p>When they say "everything is an object or a reference" they are referring specifically to data. So this naturally does not apply to statements. Of course, all expressions will result in data. For example <code>a == b</code> is <code>&lt;class 'bool'&gt;</code> because it is an expression.</p>
<p>There are some languages where <code>if</code> is an expression but python is not one of them.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Statements are the recipe of your program. They're read, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tokenize.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tokenized</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">parsed</a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile" rel="nofollow noreferrer">compiled</a> to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bytecode</a>.

<span class="comment-copy">Right ok, that makes a lot more sense. I just tested print type(a ==b), to confirm you were right, and I had a bit of a wow moment haha when it did indeed, as you said it would, print out &lt;type 'bool'&gt;. Thanks a lot!</span>
