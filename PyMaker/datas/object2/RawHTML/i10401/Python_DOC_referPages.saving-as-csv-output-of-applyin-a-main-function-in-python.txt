<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've been applying a main function in Python, by saying:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    "some code here"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Then I get a result like this:</p>
<pre><code>[['This is my car not yours'], ['He answered me sorry'], ['no problem'], ['\nYou are crazy'], ['All cars are the same'], etc...]
</code></pre>
<p>I Want to save the result in a txt and csv file to manipulate it later preserving the same structure: squared parentheses, words, commas, etc.  How can I do that?  Thanks in advance.</p>
</div>

<p>Hope this is what you wanted:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    return [['This is my car not yours'], ['He answered me sorry'], ['no problem'], ['\nYou are crazy'], ['All cars are the same']]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
        a = ('').join(str(main()))
        f.write(a)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">you can use the csv module of python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a>  it can transform the list into csv</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and to print it directly as "python", use pretty print (pprint) <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html</a> another possiblity is python urscript.py &gt; data.txt which is the shell ur using, redirecting standard output to a file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand what the <code>main()</code> function has to do with csv to be honest...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Boris, however, txt file is empty after apply your code. How to improve it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just edited my answer. You should change your <code>print</code> statement into <code>return</code>. Because I don't know your code inside main() this is my best guess.</span>
