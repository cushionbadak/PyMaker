<p>I'm currently working through Automate the Boring Stuff with Python book and run into curious issue on <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter7/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">chapter 7</a>. 
When trying to execute the following code:</p>
<pre><code>def isPhoneNumber(text):
    if len(text) != 12:
        return False

    for i in range(0, 3):
        if not text[i].isdecimal():
            return False

    if text[3] != "-":
        return False

    for i in range(4, 7):
        if not text(i).isdecimal():
            return False

    if text[7] != "-":
        return False

    for i in range(8, 12):
        if not text[i].isdecimal():
            return False

    return True


print("415-555-4242 is a phone number:")
print(isPhoneNumber("415-555-4242"))
print("Moshi moshi is a phone number:")
print(isPhoneNumber("Moshi moshi"))
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "automation.py", line 27, in &lt;module&gt;
    print(isPhoneNumber("415-555-4242"))
  File "automation.py", line 13, in isPhoneNumber
    if not text(i).isdecimal():
TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
</code></pre>
<p>Switching the str.isdecimal() method for str.isdigit() method allows me to execute the code properly, but I would like to know why the isdecimal() method will not work? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The error has nothing to do with <code>isdecimal()</code>. You have a typo in how you extract the character from <code>text</code>. The</p>
<pre><code>if not text(i).isdecimal():
</code></pre>
<p>should read</p>
<pre><code>if not text[i].isdecimal():
</code></pre>
<p>(note the square brackets.)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>  File "automation.py", line 13, in isPhoneNumber
    if not text(i).isdecimal():
TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
</code></pre>
<p>The typeError is on line 13, where you are calling a string object. Use <code>[]</code> not <code>()</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">If your book teaches you this sort of Python, then you'd better find another one. The code is very unpythonic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As @EliKorvigo says,  this would be an excellent use case for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expressions</a>. The regular expression <code>'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}'</code> matches your kind of phone numbers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>text(i).isdigit()</code> would raise the same error.  You must have fixed the () typo at the same time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EliKorvigo: Do not blame the book. All CS1-level books in Python follow this approach. Regular expressions are extremely hard to grasp for those who are taking their first programming course.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DYZ I'm more concerned about this iteration style.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Would the downvoter care to comment?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am not the downvoter, but perhaps, guessing, he thought that this answer should instead have been a comment, coupled with a vote to close as off-topic because just a typo.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NPE Thank you! Should have paid more attention for possible typos.</span>
