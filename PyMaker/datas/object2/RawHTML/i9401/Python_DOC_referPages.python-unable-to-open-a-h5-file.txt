<p>I am trying to open a HDF5 file in order to read it with python, so that I can do more things with it later. There is an error when I run the program to read the file. The program is below:</p>
<pre><code>import h5py    # HDF5 support
import numpy

fileName = "C:/.../file.h5"
f = h5py.File(fileName,  "r")
for item in f.attrs.keys():
    print item + ":", f.attrs[item]
mr = f['/entry/mr_scan/mr']
i00 = f['/entry/mr_scan/I00']
print "%s\t%s\t%s" % ("#", "mr", "I00")
for i in range(len(mr)):
    print "%d\t%g\t%d" % (i, mr[i], i00[i])
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>If I run the program I end up seeing this error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "TestHD5.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;

<p>Am I just missing some modules to read the file, or is this something else. It will open the .h5 file if I use an h5 file veiwer program. Thank you</p>

<p>The answer that @NickT posted fixed the orginal problem I had. The problem that is shown in the new version is due to the hd5 folder names in the hd5 file not matching the folder names that the code provided.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please don't post images of your code or output. Paste the code &amp; output directly, so it's much easier to work with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry I hope this makes it better @RushyPanchal</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry I hope this makes it better @RadLexus</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try putting and <code>r</code> in front of your file name;  <code>r"C:\User</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Avoid backslashes in paths like the plague. Python will happily convert forward-slashes (<code>/</code>) to backslashes on Windows for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks that got rid UnicodeDecodeError and some of the other lines that the terminal was displaying. Ill edit it so that you can see what it shows now. I am still unable to open the file.</span>
