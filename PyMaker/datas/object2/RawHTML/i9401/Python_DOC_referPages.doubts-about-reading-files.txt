<p>I have a Python file with this struct:</p>
<p>A string I want to extract plus some other information, like integers</p>
<p>For example: <code>**Room** 61201 1 png</code></p>
<p>There are a bunch of lines following the model. And to extract what I would like, I thought in ask for Python read the characters WHILE the character is different of SPACE. When character is space, go to next line and continue doing it.</p>
<p>However, I don't know how to implement that... could you guys help me?</p>
<p>[UPDATED]
I would like to store each information (Room, car, fan...) in a list.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can read through a file line by line (and execute some action for every line) like this:</p>
<pre><code>with open('filename') as file:
    for line in file:
        #do something with line here
</code></pre>
<p>Then use <code>string.split()</code> to form an array, adding a new item whenever it reads a space. So:</p>
<pre><code>array = []
with open('filename') as file:
    for line in file:
        array.append(line.split())

#Result: [['**Room**', '61201', '1', 'png']]
</code></pre>
<p>And you can manipulate the info in the array however you'd like.</p>
<p>In order to access specific information from line in your new array, run a simple for loop like so:</p>
<pre><code>item1 = []
item2 = []
item3 = []
item4 = []

for dataset in array:
    item1.append(dataset[0])
    item2.append(dataset[1])
    item3.append(dataset[2])
    item4.append(dataset[3])
</code></pre>
<p>The more pythonic way would be to use a dictionary of arrays like this:</p>
<pre><code>dataDict = {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: []}

for dataset in array:
    for i in range(len(dataset)):
        dataDict[i].append(dataset[i])
</code></pre>
<p>As long as the data is in the same order, this will append every nth element to its own array.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Your question is a bit confusing, but I think <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/</a> would be useful for you.</p>
<p>To read a file, you can use <code>open("filename", "r")</code>. For each line in the file, you could use the <code>.split(" ")</code> method to make a list. Ultimately, it would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>data = []
file = open("filename", "r")
for line in file:
    data.append(line.split(" "))
print(data)
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>The variable data would a be a list of lists.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I <i>think</i> the data's in a file, because (s)he wants to read it line by line ("When character is space, go to next line and continue doing it."). Also the question is called "Doubts about reading files"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah okay.  I'll add to my answer so at least it doesn't look stupid :P but I will upvote yours. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">haha :) no problem</span>
