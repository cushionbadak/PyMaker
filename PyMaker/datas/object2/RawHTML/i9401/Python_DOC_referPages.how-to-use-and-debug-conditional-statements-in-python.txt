<p>Whenever I enter 'n2' higher than 255, it shows enter first number. I want it to show enter second number.</p>

<p><code>continue</code> starts the whole <code>while</code> loop over: it doesn't go back to before the last <code>if</code> statement or anything like that. So your second <code>continue</code> effectively starts your program over. You need to get rid of this <code>continue</code>, and use some other method to redo this input.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is the <code>continue</code> statement in the first <code>if</code>. <code>continue</code> does not mean "go on". It means, "ignore the rest of the while/for loop, and repeat from its next iteration". So, actually, the next time you are at the input prompt, are not entering <code>n2</code>, you are again the the same line and entering <code>n1</code> again. Remove the <code>continue</code> statement.</p>
<p>Take a look at how <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> statements work, they are pretty much the same in all languages (that I know of at least)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you haven't figured out how to properly use <code>while</code>, <code>continue</code> and <code>break</code>. You can easily teach yourself that by playing with them a bit more.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean "ignore the rest of the while/for loop <b>for this iteration</b>"? Your quoted text could be misunderstood otherwise - it sounds like you are describing a break out of the loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, I tried to make it as simple as possible, but it could be misunderstood. Edited</span>
