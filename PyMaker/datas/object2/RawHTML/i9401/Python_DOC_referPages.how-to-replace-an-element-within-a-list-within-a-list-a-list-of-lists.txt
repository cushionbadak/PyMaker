<p>I am having difficulty replacing an element in a list within a list.
My code is:</p>
<pre><code>board_size = 2
number_of_squares_on_board = board_size * board_size


computers_places = []

while len(computers_places) &lt; number_of_squares_on_board:

    placing = random.randint(0, number_of_squares_on_board-1)

    if placing not in computers_places:
        computers_places.append(placing)
        row = int(placing / board_size)
        column = int(placing % board_size)
        # print(computers_places)
        print("\nplacing: ", placing)
        print("col: ", column)
        print("row: ", row)

        column_list = board[column]
        column_list[row] = "[X]"

        print(board[column][row])
        print(board)
        print(computers_places)
</code></pre>
<p>The output is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>placing:  1
col:  1
row:  0
[X]
[['[X]', '[ ]'], ['[X]', '[ ]']]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  [['[ ]', '[ ]'], ['[X]', '[ ]']]  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; This is what I expect to see
[1]

placing:  0
col:  0
row:  0
[X]
[['[X]', '[ ]'], ['[X]', '[ ]']]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  [['[X]', '[ ]'], ['[X]', '[ ]']]  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; This is what I expect to see
[1, 0]

placing:  3
col:  1
row:  1
[X]
[['[X]', '[X]'], ['[X]', '[X]']]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  [['[X]', '[ ]'], ['[X]', '[X]']]  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; This is what I expect to see
[1, 0, 3]

placing:  2
col:  0
row:  1
[X]
[['[X]', '[X]'], ['[X]', '[X]']]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  [['[X]', '[X]'], ['[X]', '[X]']]  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; This is what I expect to see
[1, 0, 3, 2]
</code></pre>
<p>However I have indicated what I expect to see with lines that start with '&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;' in the above output.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Within my code, what am I doing wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think your code is right, but maybe there is something wrong not show in the code.</p>
<p>You don't show us the initialization of <code>board</code>, I try use <code>board = [[""]*board_size] * board_size</code>, get the same output as you have shown. In the case, board is actually not your "list in list", it is one list, repeat for "board_size" times, so once you change one of the list, you change all of them.</p>
<p>I change the board initialization to <code>board = [[""]*board_size for i in range(board_size)]</code>, then I get the correct answer.</p>
<p>You can use this code to check if the lists in list are the same list or not:</p>
<pre><code>import random
board_size = 2
number_of_squares_on_board = board_size * board_size

# good list:
board = [[""]*board_size for i in range(board_size)] 
# wrong list:
board = [[""]*board_size] * board_size
# check if they were the same
for _list in board:
    print(id(_list))

computers_places = []

while len(computers_places) &lt; number_of_squares_on_board:

    placing = random.randint(0, number_of_squares_on_board-1)

    if placing not in computers_places:
        computers_places.append(placing)
        row = int(placing / board_size)
        column = int(placing % board_size)
        # print(computers_places)
        print("\nplacing: ", placing)
        print("col: ", column)
        print("row: ", row)

        column_list = board[column]
        column_list[row] = "[X]"

        print(board[column][row])
        print(board)
        print(computers_places)
