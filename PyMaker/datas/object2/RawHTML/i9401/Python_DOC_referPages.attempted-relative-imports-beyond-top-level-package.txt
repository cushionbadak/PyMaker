<p>I have a directory structure like the following:</p>
<pre><code>game/
    graphics/
          __init__.py
          render.py
    sound/
         __init__.py
         echo.py
    __init__.py
</code></pre>
<p>and my <code>render.py</code> reads <code>from ..sound.echo import echo_test</code>, 
but every time I run it it says <code>Attempted relative imports beyond top-level package</code>.<br/>
How can I fix this?</p>

<p>Do you need a relative import? </p>
<p>Can you use <code>from game.sound.echo import echo_test</code>?</p>
<p>Though, since you haven't shown the exact stacktrace, the error could be coming from <code>echo.py</code>. An attempted "import beyond top-level package" is self-explanatory, though. </p>

<p>I'm guessing that you are trying the following, or something similar: <code>python render.py</code></p>
<p>But this is treating render.py as a script and not a component of a package.  If you write an external script, where you
<code>import render</code>, and then test <code>render</code> functions, the imports should work fine.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@cricket   to be candid, i studied python only for 2 days and can get any of the comments in your link..!! i'm using pycharm, and when i typed 'from game.sound.echo', it worked well. i don't get the differene between relative importing and this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, if you studied for only two days, I might suggest to perhaps start at the tutorial. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a></span>
