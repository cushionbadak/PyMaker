<p>Your Python interpreter does not found the packages. It can be for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>You didn't install correctly the SDK (files are missing). You can use pip, "git clone" from the repo directly, or copy/pasting the "azure-servicebus" zip from PyPI and unzip it. Since you didn't share the content of your <code>pi@raspberrypi:~/azure-sdk-for-python</code> folder, I can't tell. Don't forget the dependencies if you manually install the code.</li>
<li>Your path to packages is not well defined. Again, can be fixed several ways, by defining a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PYTHONPATH</a> or changing your <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/897792/where-is-pythons-sys-path-initialized-from">sys.path</a></li>

<span class="comment-copy">why it had been down voted</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, your question was formatted very badly to start with, and hard to understand. I've improved it the best I can.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SiHa That's not a valid reason to downvote...You should know when to downvote.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't down-vote. I had a stab at improving it so that hopefully nobody else would.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes SDK Was not installed successfully.</span>
