<p>Keep getting the same thing every time I try to run the program, <code>urllib</code> is not defined.  How do I get rid of it?</p>
<pre><code>from urllib.request import urlopen
from urllib.error import HTTPError

aname = 'http://website.com'
try:
    htm = urlopen(aname + '/').read()
except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
    print(e)
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, I do have another problem I sure wish I could figure out as well, I can't get <code>bs4</code> to install correctly, it keep trying to install to Python 2.7, which I don't have any 2.7 interpreter installed, only 3.4.3 is installed on the computer.  I have a strange feeling that might be causing me some other issues as well with some some other programs.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just because you have the line <code>from urllib.error import HTTPError</code> or the <code>from urllib.request import urlopen</code> <em>doesn't</em> mean that <code>urrlib</code> is available as a name in your script.</p>
<p>This is specified <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in the documentation for the <code>import</code></a> statement specifically in the section dealing with the <code>from</code> form; see the examples there to see what becomes available and what doesn't.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you <code>except</code>:</p>
<pre><code>except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
</code></pre>
<p>it fails when trying to find the name <code>urrlib</code>. Either just use <code>HTTPError</code>, as imported and bound to your namespace, in the <code>except</code> clause:</p>
<pre><code>except HTTPError as e:
</code></pre>
<p>or, if you <em>need</em> the name for <code>urllib</code> available in your namespace, <code>import urllib</code> instead of <code>from urllib.error import HTTPError</code> and use the original <code>except</code> clause.</p>
<p>As for the installation issue, try using <code>pip3</code> instead of <code>pip</code>. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">That appears to have taken care of the urllib problem.  As for the bs4 I've tried installing it both ways...pip3 install python3 beautilfulsoup4.  Doing it this way all I get is an error 'Could not find a version that satisfies the requirements python3.  I also tried...pip3 install beautifulsoup4 and it comes up as says the requirement is already satisfied and shows it being in usr/local/lib/python2.7.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@confused Not sure about your <code>pip</code> issues, it doesn't make sense to me for it to be saying that beautifulsoup4 exists in the directory for <code>2.7</code>, try going through Python with <code>python3 -m pip install beautifulsoup4</code>.</span>
