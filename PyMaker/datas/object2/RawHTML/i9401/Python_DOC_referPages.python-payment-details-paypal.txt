<p>Im new with Paypal SDK, I want to get the payment details from the transaction id, my code is below:</p>
<pre><code>import libs.paypalrestsdk as Paypals

api = Paypals.configure({
    "mode": "sandbox",
    "client_id": "MY-CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "MY-SECRET"
})

payment = Paypals.Payment.find("5LA50068PM345884U")
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><p>How can execute it?</p></li>
<li><p>How can pass my client_id and secret to use in the transaction?</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I use the <strong>PayPal Classic API</strong> to get the PayPal transaction details:</p>
<pre><code>pip install paypal
</code></pre>
<p>.</p>
<pre><code>from paypal import PayPalInterface

paypal_api = PayPalInterface(
    API_USERNAME    = username,
    API_PASSWORD    = secret,
    API_SIGNATURE   = signatur,
    API_ENVIRONMENT = environment,
    DEBUG_LEVEL=0,
    HTTP_TIMEOUT=30
    )

transaction_details = paypal_api._call(
    'GetTransactionDetails',
    TRANSACTIONID=transaction_id
    )
</code></pre>

<li><p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paypal/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paypal/</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>And to answer you questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>You executed it with <strong>Paypals.Payment.find(…)</strong></li>
<li>You don't need to pass it because only have to connect one time with <strong>Paypals.configure(…)</strong></li>
</ol>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">

<span class="comment-copy">Are you asking how to write and execute Python code? Try the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Tutorial</a> in that case. Otherwise you need to clarify what the problem is</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know how can execute but in the example of paypal is not clarify for me!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which part of it is unclear?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I follow this example of the paypal documentation <a href="https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Python-SDK/blob/master/samples/payment/execute_with_updated_shipping.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/paypal/PayPal-Python-SDK/blob/master/samples/payment/…</a> but in this example update the payment but I only want to get the transaction information so I only need to execute the payment.find?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you also try their actual <code>find</code> <a href="https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Python-SDK/blob/master/samples/payment/find.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">example</a>? Also it's still rather unclear where your problem is - that question makes it seem as if you didn't even attempt to execute your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your answer help me a lot but now i want to get the connection status but when i try to print the status of  "ACK" if the connection is success print the value and if is failed not, could you help me?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please give example, I never tried to get "connection status". Maybe I was wrong and you don't even connect with  Paypals.configure(…). Maybe you only set infos with this and then send the infos with every "find" call. But you can get the status of an call with transactions.raw["ACK"][0]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I apologize to not answer you but i solved my problem, now I have troubles cause i want to authorize the payment but always have an transaction id invalid, I used DoAuthorization</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I only search and read payments. Never done something else :-)</span>
