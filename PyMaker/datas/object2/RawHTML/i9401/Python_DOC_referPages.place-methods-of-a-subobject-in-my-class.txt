<p>I know that what I'm doing is probably not the best way to do it, but right now I can't think of another way. </p>
<p>What I basically have is this: </p>
<pre><code>class foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bar = ['bundy']
</code></pre>
<p>Currently, I'm defining a lot of methods for my class to return the result of the method on the list, like this:</p>
<pre><code>def __len__(self):
    return len(self.bar)
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, there are also other methods and objects which are not to do with <code>bar</code> - I'm not reinventing the <code>list</code></p>
<p>Is there an easier way to 'copy' the methods, so that I don't have to define them all one by one? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to define some methods one by one, like you are doing.
However, there is a base-class in Python, other than list, that gives you a well defined way of which methods you need to supply, and defines the remaining methods that can be based on this minimum set.</p>
<p>These are the provided "<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">abstract base classes</a>" - what you want is to implement your object as a "Mutable Sequence" - them you only have to implement <code>__getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__, __len__, insert</code> to have the full list functionality.</p>
<p>In python 3.x, just inherit your class from <code>collections.abc.MutableSequence</code> and implement those. (In Python 2.7 it is <code>collection.MutableSequence</code> instead.).</p>
<p>By doing this, you will get for free <code>__contains__, __iter__, __reversed__, index, count, append, reverse, extend, pop, remove</code> and <code>__iadd__</code>   methods.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Which list methods do you want to copy? All of them?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Currently, yes, all of them - I think all my other methods are going to be ... not <code>__</code> 'd (What's the word for that?)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you just inherit from <code>list</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As far as I'm aware, no - as all of <code>list</code>'s methods would work on <code>list</code>'s list attribute (?) rather than <code>bar</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why does <code>bar</code> have to be an attribute? If you want to implement all of the same methods as <code>list</code>, and then add some of your own, that sounds an awful lot like extending the <code>list</code> class.</span>
