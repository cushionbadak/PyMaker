<p>The question in my book I am working through (I am new to programming) is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Threes: Make a list of the multiples of 3 from 3 to 30. Use a <em>for</em> loop to print the numbers in your list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have tried a few different things to do this, but in my book <em>Python Crash Course</em>, it doesn't explain the syntax or show me examples on how to do multiples. Only exponents. I have reread the chapter several times over and still am not able to find the tutorial on how to do this. And also, being that I am new to programming, I don't exactly know the keywords or phrases I should be searching for.</p>
<p>It would be of great help to me (I've been confused by this for over an hour) if someone could explain this to me and give me an example.</p>

<p>It's easy, you can use the <code>range</code> function to iterate over a sequence of numbers and then create the list by examining the result of <code>value % 3</code> (modulus 3). If it is zero, you got a multiple, if not, you don't:</p>
<pre><code># Create an empty list
l = []  
# 31 because the end of the range is exclusive
for i in range(3, 31):
    # if equal to zero it is a multiple of 3
    if i % 3 == 0:  
        # add it to the list
        l.append(i)   
</code></pre>
<p>This can be mushed into a single line called a comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>l = [i for i in range(3, 31) if i % 3 == 0]
</code></pre>
<p>As for printing, you can tackle it, you use a similar <code>for</code> loop through the list <code>l</code> created and then use the <code>print</code> function!</p>
<p>Since you're new to the language, go over to the Python homepage and read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the official tutorial on the language</a>, it is nicely written and will help you much more than any answer can.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>if n % 3 == 0:</code> then it is a multiples of 3. Also just search around <i>python multiple of ...</i> I find a fair few answers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StevenSummers I can't seem to find any targets that would make things clearer rather than confuse more. If you find any flag/vtc as dupe so I can hammer it.</span>
