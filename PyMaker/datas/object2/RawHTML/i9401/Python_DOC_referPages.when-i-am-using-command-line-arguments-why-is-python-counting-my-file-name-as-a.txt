<p>I have tried to fix it and have looked over my code many times, but nothing really seems wrong.</p>
<p>I had unpacked the module to 3 values and tried run the program, but it gave me the error that I was giving too many values:</p>
<p>PS C:\dir1&gt; python exlp.py ramen lucid chubby</p>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last):</p>
<p>File "exlp.py", line 54, in </p>
<pre><code>ramen, lucid, chubby = argv
</code></pre>
<p>ValueError: too many values to unpack</p>
<p>After a while I figured out that it was counting the file name as a value. I have no clue why this is happening, but here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>  from sys import argv

sakura, ramen, lucid, chubby = argv

print "You love...", sakura
print "You like to eat...", ramen
print "Your dreams are...", lucid
print "You are...", Naruto

print raw_input('Do you know someone named Naruto?')
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Because that's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">what it does</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><code>sys.argv</code></h2>
<p>The list of command line arguments passed to a Python
  script. <code>argv[0]</code> is the script name (it is operating system dependent
  whether this is a full pathname or not). If the command was executed
  using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-c" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>-c</code></a> command line option to the interpreter, <code>argv[0]</code> is set to
  the string <code>'-c'</code>. If no script name was passed to the Python
  interpreter, <code>argv[0]</code> is the empty string.</p>
<p>To loop over the standard input, or the list of files given on the
  command line, see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html#module-fileinput" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fileinput</a> module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Either account for that value or slice that list:</p>
<pre><code>_, ramen, lucid, chubby = argv # option 1
ramen, lucid, chubby = argv[1:] # option 2
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">it is standard behaviour since language C was created about 45 yeas ago.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Would the "_" appear when I run the program in option 1?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PenguinBros - It's just a variable name, conventionally used for throwaway variables.</span>
