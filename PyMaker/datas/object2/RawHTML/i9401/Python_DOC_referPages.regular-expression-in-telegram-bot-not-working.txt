<p>I have spent three days trying to make my bot smarter, but I can't understand how to write a regular expression. I want search in the user's message and send an answer to it:</p>
<pre><code>import re
@bot.message_handler(content_types=['text'])
def handle_text(message):
    if message.text == re.search(r'hello','Hello'):
        bot.reply_to(message, "Welcome")
</code></pre>
<p>This isn't working, the bot just ignores my message.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd first suggest you read the documentation for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re</code></a> - its use can be quite subtle at times.</p>
<p>I'll presume that what you're trying to do is run the function <code>if message.text == "Hello"</code>. With that, the snippet you're looking for is</p>
<pre><code>if re.search(r'Hello|hello', message.text):
    #do things
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You <code>if</code> and <code>re</code> expression is weird. What logic do you want to implement? If you want to check does <code>message.text</code> contain <code>hello</code> or <code>Hello</code> (exactly) you should use:</p>
<pre><code>if re.search(r'hello|Hello', message.text):
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">That doesn't make any sense. <code>re.search(r'hello','Hello') is None</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe checking <code>is None</code> is not python style. Simple <code>if re.search(...)</code> is sufficient.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DmitryFrolov it is when you want to explicitly test for <code>None</code> (vs. for example <code>""</code>, which also evaluates false-y). Also I'm not suggesting it as a conditional, I'm trying to point out that such a function call <b>always</b> evaluates to <code>None</code> (which is probably <code>!= message.text</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Dammit, 30 seconds late!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You <code>if</code> is not in python syntax.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm. Whilst I'll concede the parentheses are optional, I always worked under the impression that they weren't incorrect syntax?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DmitryFrolov it's not the Python <i>convention</i> (per <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP-8</a>), but it <i>is</i> still syntactically valid.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe Yes, I know. But it is no OK to use such expressions.</span>
