<p>I'm trying to make a program that will launch programs for me, but some programs python just won't find. I've been using the technique of:</p>
<pre><code>if action == "Powerpoint":
    import os
    os.startfile("C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\POWERPNT.exe")
</code></pre>
<p>And this has worked for all of my other programs but this one just doesn't work.</p>

<p>Backslashes in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string literals</a> are special:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[String literals] can be enclosed in matching single quotes (<code>'</code>) or double quotes (<code>"</code>)...The backslash (<code>\</code>) character is used to escape characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>\r</code> in your string:</p>
<pre><code>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\POWERPNT.exe"
                                        ^^
</code></pre>
<p>is being interpreted as an escape sequence meaning carriage return, not a literal backslash followed by a literal "r".</p>
<p>You should use a raw string so backslashes aren't interpreted as escape sequences:</p>
<pre><code>r"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\POWERPNT.exe"
</code></pre>
