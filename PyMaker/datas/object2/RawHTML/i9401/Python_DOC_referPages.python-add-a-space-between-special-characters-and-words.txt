<p>I am working on a data science project and I have an issue. I have an array full of string like the following string and I want to add a space between the words and between the special characters</p>
<pre><code>sentence[i] = 'This is a⓵⓶⓷string'
</code></pre>
<p>and I expect something like that:</p>
<pre><code>sentence[i] = 'This is a ⓵ ⓶ ⓷ string'
</code></pre>
<p>My last try:</p>
<pre><code>l=[]
for i in lines:
    for j in i:
        if j.isalpha() == False:
            l.append(i.split())
        else:
            l.append(i)

print(l)

for i in l:
    s = ' '.join(i)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could simply scan the complete line and selectively add space for each character that is neither alphabet nor a space.</p>
<pre><code>s = 'This is a⓵⓶⓷string'
t = ''
for x in s :
    if not str.isalpha(x) and x != ' ' :
        if t[-1] != ' ':
            t+= ' '
        t += x
        t += ' '
    else: t += x
</code></pre>
<p>this works for example you have given.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expressions</a> to accomplish that task, specifically <code>re.sub</code> together with a <em>backreference</em> in order to surround the matched characters with spaces.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">have you tried to solve this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes with split join methods but its too hard for me...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">with other unicode characters i dont have that issue</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why i take a negative vote again ???</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show a code you tried ? Maybe that's why someone downvote</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i already try it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">unicode range: u"\U00002460-\U000024FF"</span>
