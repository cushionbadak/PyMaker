<p>I am using the following code and it returns: </p>
<pre><code>now = time.strftime("%c")
Out[196]: 
'Mon Jan  9 18:34:48 2017'
</code></pre>
<p>We have some parsers that read the timestamps, and they expect the following convention:</p>
<pre><code>Mon Jan  9 17:02:40 PST 2017
</code></pre>
<p>The main difference is between the seconds and the year my code is missing the timezone. I have played around with the <code>time.strftime</code> and <code>datetime</code> libraries, however I'm still not able to get the alignment of the timestamp I'm looking for.</p>
<p>I also thought I could insert or join the timestamp into my existing string that was missing the timezone, however even that was not working for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can get the timezone using <code>datetime</code> instead of <code>time</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime as dt
from tzlocal import get_localzone  # $ pip install tzlocal
local_tz = get_localzone()

now = dt.datetime.now(local_tz)
print now.strftime('%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Z %Y')
</code></pre>
<p>Be sure to assign a timezone to the <code>datetime</code> as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">naive</a> timestamps will not display a timezone.</p>
<p>The above produces:</p>
<pre><code>Mon Jan 09 19:40:28 PST 2017
</code></pre>
