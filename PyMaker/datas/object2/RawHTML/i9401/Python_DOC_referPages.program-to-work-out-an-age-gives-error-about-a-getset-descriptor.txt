<p>I am trying to write a very simple Python program to work out someone's age and I think, in theory, it should work however every time I try to run it, it throws this error: </p>
<pre><code>What year were you born in? 2005
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "python", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'getset_descriptor' and 'int'
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried turning <code>datetime.year</code> and <code>(year)</code>  (same things) in to integers. It worked but didn't make a difference as the both are already integers. This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime
year = datetime.year
born = input("What year were you born in?")
born = int(born)
end = year - born
print(end)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>year = datetime.year</code> does not give you the current year. It gives you an unbound <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">descriptor object</a> instead (the <code>getset_descriptor</code> in your error):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.year
&lt;attribute 'year' of 'datetime.date' objects&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(datetime.year)
&lt;class 'getset_descriptor'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.year - 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>Don't worry too much about the exact type of object here, that's just an implementation detail needed to make instances of a built-in immutable type like <code>datetime</code> work. It just means you don't have an <em>instance</em> of the <code>datetime</code> type, so there is no <code>year</code> value for that instance either.</p>
<p>If you want the current year, use <code>datetime.now().year</code>:</p>
<pre><code>year = datetime.now().year
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.now" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.now()</code></a> gives you a <code>datetime</code> <em>instance</em>, the one representing the current time and date. That instance has a valid <code>year</code> attribute.</p>
<p>You could also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.today" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.date.today()</code></a> of course:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime, date
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.now()
datetime.datetime(2016, 12, 31, 14, 58, 14, 994030)
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.now().year
2016
&gt;&gt;&gt; date.today().year
2016
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I am sorry, I don't understand. What is a getset_descriptor?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I do like you answer though, there are only some parts that I don't understand.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kiran: it is an internal object on some Python built-in types that are defined in C, where those objects don't have a <code>__dict__</code> attribute on the instances. In other words, a specialist implementation detail you don't normally need to worry about.</span>
