<p>There are multiple modules I use on a daily basis, and importing all of them every time I want to use them is quite bothersome.</p>
<p>I was hoping for something such as this</p>
<pre><code>#essentials.py
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
etc etc
</code></pre>
<p>Then in something else, I could do:</p>
<pre><code>import essentials
r = requests.get(example) #Requests is not defined here, as I have not imported it
soup  = BeautifulSoup(r, 'lxml')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>from essentials import *
</code></pre>
<p>This will put all the names in <code>essentials.py</code> into the namespace of the module, if this is done in the top-level of the module.</p>
<p>So you can do</p>
<pre><code>from essentials import *
r = requests.get(example)
soup  = BeautifulSoup(r, 'lxml')
</code></pre>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the official documentation for reference</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>from essentials import *</code> could be an approach. However, I find it saner to explicitly list imports as needed. It's not that hard. If you use a decent IDE it can add the <code>import</code> statement semi-automatically the first time you mention the module name.</span>
