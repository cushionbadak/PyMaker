<p>I have a general debugging question in python (pycharm IDE if it matters)</p>
<p>Lets say I have code which is made up of 2 blocks:</p>
<pre><code>Code block 1 (takes very long to run)
Code block 2 (where I want to debug)
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to save the current variables at the end of running code block 1, so that I can "rewind" back to those variables states and debug from there, without having the re-run the entire script to recompute those variables?</p>

<p>I am unaware of a general solution to this problem.  But an application specific solution can be constructed using various methods for serializing objects, but I would suggest <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pickle</a> for this problem.</p>
<p>Like so much else, there is a small example already on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11218477/how-can-i-use-pickle-to-save-a-dict">SO</a>.</p>

<p>You can certainly "save" the current variables at the end of running code block 1. Just store the variables in a dictionary and write that to a file after the first code block finishes.</p>
<p>Here's a very minimal example, since you provided no data:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

# code block 1
for i in range(1000000): # meant to simulate a "long" time
    var1 = 2*i
    var2 = 4*i

# basically this is a log that keeps track of the values of these variables
to_save = {'var1': var1, 'var2': var2}

# write that dictionary to a file
with open('my_log.csv', 'w+') as f:
    w = csv.DictWriter(f, to_save.keys())
    w.writeheader()
    w.writerow(to_save)

# continue with code block 2
for i in range(1000):
    var1 = "BLAH"
    var2 = "BLAH BLAH"
</code></pre>
</div>
