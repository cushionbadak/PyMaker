<p>i get the error with " if password == &lt;8 "
can you help me please????</p>

<p>As others have suggested I'd read the documentation on indentation in python as well as how to use if/else.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to compare the length of password, using <code>len()</code>.</p>
<p>You also need to use <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&lt;=</code> to compare it rather than <code>==</code>, and put a colon at the end of the if statement.</p>
<p>So your code would look like:</p>
<pre><code>if len(password) &lt;= 8:
    print("this is too short, rethink, and re-enter your new password...")
if len(password) &gt;=16:
    print("this is too long, rethink, and re-enter your new password...")
</code></pre>
<p>Which you could simplify to</p>
<pre><code>if len(password) &lt;= 8 or len(password) &gt;= 16:
    print("Password must be between 8 and 16 characters, enter your new password...")
</code></pre>
<p>To get the user to re-enter a password, you could loop until their input is valid using <code>while</code>:</p>
<pre><code>while(len(password) &lt;= 8 or len(password) &gt;= 16):
    print("Password must be between 8 and 16 characters, enter your new password...")
    password=input("type your new password")
</code></pre>
<p>You could use this again to check the user enters the same password:</p>
<pre><code>password2 = input("re-enter your password")
while password2!=password:
     password2=input("this is not the same as your first password")
print("your password has been changed")
</code></pre>
<p>As other users have mentioned, you should look at hashing:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First, there is no such thing as  'x== &lt; y'. You're looking for 'x &lt;= y'.</p>
<p>Second, as stated in answers before me, you have to add ':' after the if.</p>
<p>You should read the docs.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is a couple things wrong with your code and I'm guessing you maybe coming from a JavaScript background.</p>
<p>The issues are as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>You are missing the <code>:</code> at the end of your <code>if</code> statements.</li>
<li>You can't use <code>== &lt;</code> or <code>== &gt;</code> in Python the correct one to use is <code>&lt;=</code> and <code>&gt;=</code>.</li>
<li>You also have incorrect indentation for your <code>if</code> statements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Updated code below.</p>
<pre><code>print("welcome to the password reset program")
print("please enter the new password")
input("type your new password")
input("type your new password (8-16 characters)")
password = input("type your new password (8-16 characters)")
if len(password) &lt;= 8:
    print("this is too short, rethink, and re-enter your new password...")
if len(password) &gt;= 16:
    print("this is too long, rethink, and re-enter your new password...")
if len(password) == (8-16): # is this a range or 8 - 16?
    print("this is the correct length, now re-enter to confirm")
password2 = input("re-enter your password")
if password == password2:
    print("your password has been changed")
if password != password2:
    print("this is not the same as your first password")
</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget to hash the passwords.<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<ol>
<li>You need to add <code>:</code> after each if, for or while statement.</li>
<li>The operators <code>== &lt;</code> or <code>== &gt;</code> doesnt exist, you can use <code>=&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;=</code> instead</li>
<li>In this line: <code>if password == 8-16</code> you can use the operator <code>in</code> to evaluate that the variable is in a list, souch as <code>if len(password) in range(8-16)</code></li>
</ol>
<p>In your case could be</p>
<pre><code>if password &lt;= 8
        print("this is too short, rethink, and re-enter your new password...")
    if password &gt;= 16
        print("this is too long, rethink, and re-enter your new password...")
    if len(password) in range(8, 16)
        print("this is the correct length, now re-enter to confirm")
password2 = input("re-enter your password")
    if password == password2
        print("your password has been changed")
    if password != password2
        print("this is not the same as your first password")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Check python doc. You have to use <code>:</code> after if. Like this<code>if some_value:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have an <code>unexpected indent</code> at the <code>if password == &lt;8 </code> line and you need to add a <code>:</code> at the end of the line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should think about taking a look at some Python tutorials.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't mind downvotes but a comment to explain would be appreciated!</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>password &gt;= 16:</code> is wrong. Also, answers without explanation aren't very useful</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I forgot to change it the second time. And I agree about the explanation but most was already said in the comments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you are missing a ":" on line 3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, fixed now</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It would also be worth linking or informing the OP about hashing. If they are going to play with passwords they should know about hashing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure why I got a down vote for my answer when it is technically correct and answers the users question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>(8-16)</code> is not a range</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't say it was. I made an inline comment asking if that's what the OP was looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The indentation is wrong, you didn't add <code>:</code> anywhere, and comparing <code>password</code> and integers is meaningless.</span>
