<p>I am new to Python, I have a following example that I don't understand</p>
<p>The following is a csv file with some data</p>
<pre><code>%%writefile wood.csv
item,material,number
100,oak,33
110,maple,14
120,oak,7
145,birch,3
</code></pre>
<p>Then, the example tries to define a function to convert those trees name above to integers. </p>
<pre><code>tree_to_int = dict(oak = 1,
                   maple=2,
                   birch=3)

def convert(s):
    return tree_to_int.get(s, 0)
</code></pre>
<p>The first question is why is there a "0" after "s"? I removed that "0" and get same result.</p>
<p>The last step is to read those data by numpy.array</p>
<pre><code>data = np.genfromtxt('wood.csv',
                     delimiter=',', 
                     dtype=np.int, 
                     names=True,   
                     converters={1:convert}
                    )
</code></pre>
<p>I was wondering for the converters argument, what does {1:convert} exact mean? Especially what does number 1 mean in this case? </p>

<p>For the second question, according to the documentation (<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.genfromtxt.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.genfromtxt.html</a>), <code>{1:convert}</code> is a dictionary whose keys are column numbers (where the first column is column 0) and whose values are functions that convert the entries in that column. </p>
<p>So in this code, the 1 indicates column one of the csv file, the one with the names of the trees. Including this argument causes numpy to use the <code>convert</code> function to replace the tree names with their corresponding numbers in <code>data</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@WarrenWeckesser Okay, that documentation is pretty straightforward. Would you mind answering my second question?</span>
