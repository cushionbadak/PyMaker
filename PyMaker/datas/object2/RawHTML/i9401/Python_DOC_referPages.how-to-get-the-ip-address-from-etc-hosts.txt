<p>I have the following line in my <code>/etc/hosts</code> file  </p>
<pre>
54.230.202.149 gs2.ww.prod.dl.playstation.net
</pre>
<p>What I'm trying to do is, find the line <code>gs2</code> in the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file and get the current IP address.  This is what I have, but it doesn't find the DNS or return the IP address. It tells me that my current IP address is 'None'.</p>
<pre><code>try:
     with open('/etc/hosts', 'r') as f:
         for line in f:
             host_ip = re.findall(r"\b(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b.+(?=gs2)", line)
             if host_ip:

c.execute('INTERT INTO status VALUES(?,?,?,?,?,?)',

<p>Not sure what the problem is. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Do this using .split(), which will split your line based on whitespace into separate indexed elements.</p>
<p>Also note that using this approach removes the need for <code>host_ip[0].strip()</code>, because all whitespace between IP address and hostname is removed during the <code>split()</code> operation. You can just use <code>host_ip[0]</code>.</p>
<pre><code>try:
     with open('/etc/hosts', 'r') as f:
         for line in f:
             host_ip = line.split()
             if host_ip and 'gs2' in host_ip[1][0:3]:
                 current_ip = host_ip[0]
             else:
                 current_ip = 'None'

<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split</a>:</p>
<p>(See URL for further discussion of split()).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>str.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If sep is not specified or is None, a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace. Consequently, splitting an empty string or a string consisting of just whitespace with a None separator returns [].</p>

<p>Your regex was working, I think the way the script was reading the lines was skewed a little bit as when I tested it didn't read my lines after a blank space. I ended up adding the lines variable. I am sure there is a more pythonic way to achieve this but it works. </p>

try:
    with open(r'/etc/hosts') as f:
        lines = [line for line in f.read().splitlines() if line]
