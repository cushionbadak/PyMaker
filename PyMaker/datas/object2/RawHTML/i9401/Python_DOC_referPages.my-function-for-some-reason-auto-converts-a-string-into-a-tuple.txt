<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm very confused here. I'm trying to pass an optional string parameter to my function, but once the parameter is added, it converts the string to a tuple? How can I stop it from doing that or convert back?</p>
<p>I have this:</p>
<pre><code>def fen2grid(note, *optional)
    print(optional)
    # here it does other stuff
</code></pre>
<p>With this when I call it:</p>
<pre><code>fen2grid(example, '.')
</code></pre>
<p>now... the print is supposed to print a period. Just .
This is just a test before I use it in the function and it seems to be a good thing that I'm testing it.What it prints is </p>
<p>('.',) </p>
<p>I need the period because I need to work with that (it can be any other symbol too)</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p><code>*args</code> reads an arbitrary number of arguments and encloses them as a tuple. To access them you can simply do <code>print(args[0])</code> or <code>[print(x) for x in args]</code></p>
<p>Edit: Keep in mind that neither args or kwargs are keywords, you can replace them for any other placeholder preceded by * or **</p>

<p><code>*optional</code> isn't quite how you do that. At least not for default/keyword argument like you are trying to use. That <em>is a tuple</em>. </p>
<p>Try </p>
<pre><code>def fen2grid(note, optional=None)
    print(optional)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, this worked, I had no idea this was how it worked. It looks like a list to me and we're using the index 0. This made it clear!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This works, too. Why though? What does =None do?</span>
