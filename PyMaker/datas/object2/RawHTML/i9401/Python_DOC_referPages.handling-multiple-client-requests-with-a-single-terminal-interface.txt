<p>So I made a server script, and a client script and now I (server script) want to respond to multiple client scripts with a single terminal interface on which my server script is running. How do I do that, help. </p>

<p>Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/socketserver.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> provides 2 ways using built in to create a TCP server which can handle multiple clients concurrently.  Both ways have source code <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/socketserver.py#L624" rel="nofollow noreferrer">available</a> too</p>
<p>In addition to a threading/multiprocess based approach you could use an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">event loop approach</a> to handle multiple clients concurrently, using a single thread and process</p>
