<p>Here is the code I have so far:</p>
<p><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/spTKa.png"/></p>
<p>How can I make this program open another python file, using this method or similar (you have to open it from a variable)? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">exec</a> function, for to execute an external script,</p>
<pre><code>file = "test.py"
exec(open(file).read())
</code></pre>
<p>you get,</p>
<pre><code>File Opened!
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Please copy and paste the code here.  Do you want to run the code from the other file or manipulate it as text?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Code for first part: file = ("test.py") import file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">second part is just print ("File Opened")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and I'm trying to run the code from the other file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have inlined your image and reworded your question, but it still needs work. Please don't paste code as screenshots. Images can't be searched or copied, and offer poor usability. Instead, paste the code as text.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm going to try and explain the problem best I can:</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have a code that looks for a line in a text file. The line I'm looking for ends in .py e.g. One of the lines in the text file is: iPhone5C16GB.py, and that it also the name of the python file I want to open. That line is then saved into a variable. When I try and open the text file with the variable name I get this error message:                                     Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:\TEST\Task 3\Final code task 3.py", line 28, in &lt;module&gt;     exec(open(file).read()) #opens it OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument: 'iPhone5S16.py\n'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">any help or do i need to redesign?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@googlecoolcat you must use <code>strip</code> function, before, this remove <code>\n</code> character <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string doc</a></span>
