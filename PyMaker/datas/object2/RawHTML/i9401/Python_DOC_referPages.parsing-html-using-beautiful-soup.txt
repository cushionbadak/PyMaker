<p>I am a newbie in Python and have a simple question on parsing html. I am using Beautiful soup to get upto this point. I want to extract the taxes and maintenance from the below. I am not sure how to do this. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>div class="estimated_payment clickable overlay_trigger hidden-xs"<br/>
  id="overlay_trigger_1255749" se:behavior="monthly_payment"
  se:monthly_payment:attributes='{"id":1255749,"taxes":3682.0,"price":5500000,"maintenance":1875.0,"mortgage_rate":3.5,"mortgage_term":30,"down_payment_amount":1100000.0,"down_payment_rate":20.0,"min_down_payment_rate":20.0,"min_down_payment_amount":1100000.0}'&gt;
  Est.
  Payment: <b>$0</b> </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to do it in two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>locate the element and extract the <code>se:monthly_payment:attributes</code> attribute value</li>
<li>load it via <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.loads" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json.loads()</code></a> to a Python dictionary and get the desired amounts by keys</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation:</p>
<pre><code>import json

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup


data = """
&lt;div class="estimated_payment clickable overlay_trigger hidden-xs"
     id="overlay_trigger_1255749"
     se:behavior="monthly_payment"
     se:monthly_payment:attributes='{"id":1255749,"taxes":3682.0,"price":5500000,"maintenance":1875.0,"mortgage_rate":3.5,"mortgage_term":30,"down_payment_amount":1100000.0,"down_payment_rate":20.0,"min_down_payment_rate":20.0,"min_down_payment_amount":1100000.0}'&gt;
     Est. Payment: $0
&lt;/div&gt;
"""
soup = BeautifulSoup(data, "html.parser")

attr_value = soup.select_one(".estimated_payment")["se:monthly_payment:attributes"]
payment_data = json.loads(attr_value)

print(payment_data["taxes"])
print(payment_data["maintenance"])
</code></pre>
<p>Prints:</p>
<pre><code>3682.0
1875.0
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks so much! do you have a good source that can help me with these basics</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@qfd well, the <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official documentation</a> is really detailed and covers a lot. Also, you can get all <code>beautifulsoup</code> tagged questions here on SO, sort them by votes and study - this is usually a good way to get introduced to the most common use cases and problems coming up while working with the library. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@qfd please accept the answer to close this question.</span>
