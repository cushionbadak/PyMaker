<p>I am currently learning how to code python 2.7 but I have run into a confusing error in the following code which attempts (very inefficiently I assume) to return the median of an input.</p>
<pre><code>def median(lst):

    lst = lst.sort()
    median = 0

    if len(lst) == 1:
        median = lst[0]            
    elif len(lst) % 2 == 0:
        median_sum = lst[len(lst) / 2 - 1] + lst[len(lst) / 2 + 1]
        median = median_sum / 2.0
    else:
        median = lst[len(lst)/ 2 - 1]

    return median

print median([1])
</code></pre>
<p>above is my code and it keeps giving me the following error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Python27/SAVED DOCS/test3.py", line 16, in &lt;module&gt;
    print median([1])
  File "C:/Python27/SAVED DOCS/test3.py", line 6, in median
    if len(lst) == 1:
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
</code></pre>
<p>it seems as though it is having an issue with me calling len(lst) where lst = [1] because python seems to think it is a None variable? I'm quite confused.</p>
<p>On the console terminal for python I can type len([1]) and I get a result of 1 without any issue. Also keep in mind I am fully aware this is not the best way to do what I am trying to do but I am just starting to learn python!</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><code>lst.sort()</code> sorts the list in-place and returns <code>None</code>. So <code>lst = lst.sort()</code> sets <code>lst</code> to <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>I think the best fix is to do</p>
<pre><code>lst = sorted(lst)
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn't change the list in-place, so that variables referring to the same list outside of this function are unchanged.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your title is mistaken. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list.sort()</a> returns None because it operates by side effect; the first line discarded the list. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of using <code>lst.sort()</code> which returns <code>None</code>, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sorted()</code></a> built-in function like below:</p>
<pre><code>lst = sorted(lst)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code>lst</code> contains your sorted list.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>think your problem is that lst.sort() returns None. </p>
<p>"TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()"</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It didn't occur to you to actually check the value of <code>lst</code>?!?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what do you mean? I was assuming the input would always be a list of integers if thats what youre referring to?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You change <code>lst</code> at the start of the function; you didn't check to see what it got changed to?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh wow ok - was not aware. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">out of curiosity: is there a reason you prefer <code>lst = sorted(lst)</code> to <code>lst.sort()</code>? (i don't disagree here! +1'd anyway!)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>.sort()</code> was designed to return <code>None</code> to remind the programmer that it sorts in-place. Isn't it ironic?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hiroprotagonist: yes, if you use lst.sort(), then any variable outside of the function referring to this list is also sorted, a function shouldn't mutate its arguments unexpectedly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh, good point. but if <code>lst</code> were local only (and not a function argument or something with potentially other side-effects) then there is no difference, right?</span>
