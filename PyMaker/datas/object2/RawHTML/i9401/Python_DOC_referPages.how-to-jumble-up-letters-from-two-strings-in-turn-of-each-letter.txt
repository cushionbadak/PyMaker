<p>Turns out to be an extension, to do this. For example:

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If the two words are of same length, you can use <code>zip</code>:</p>
<pre><code>''.join(x for p in zip(*"hello world".split(" ")) for x in p)
# 'hweolrllod'

''.join(x for p in zip("hello", "world") for x in p)
# 'hweolrllod'
</code></pre>
<p>If they are not of the same length, and you want to keep the longer version, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zip_longest</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import zip_longest    
''.join(x for p in zip_longest(*"he world".split(" "), fillvalue='') for x in p)
# 'hweorld'

''.join(x for p in zip_longest("he", "world", fillvalue='') for x in p)
# 'hweorld'
</code></pre>
