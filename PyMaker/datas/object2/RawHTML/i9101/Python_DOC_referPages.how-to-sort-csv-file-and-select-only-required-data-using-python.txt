<p>Look at "csv" from python at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a>.  this should get you close:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import csv
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('schools.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
...     reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',', quotechar='"')
...     for row in reader:
...         if 'MAHARASTRA' in row:
...             print(', '.join(row))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why is this tagged "database"?  Why do you need to sort the data to extract only certain records?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tagged database , because I thought some Dev database analyst can also be aligible to give ans ! I wanted to sort and then extract that certain record so that the remaining data will be in convenient form ! @scott Hunter</span>
