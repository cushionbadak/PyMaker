<p>I am new to programming and trying to get a head start on my class next semester. I am trying to show the total cost and then print it. Where am I going wrong? </p>
<pre><code>print('Would you like a rental car?')
rental = (input('Yes or No? '))
    if rental.lower() == yes:
        car = float(input('Dollar Amount?'))
    else:

print('Would you need a flight?')
flight = (input('Yes or No '))
    if flight.lower() == yes:
        plane = float(input('Dollar Amount? '))
    else:
        print('Thank You!')

print('Would need a hotel?')
hotel = (input('Yes or No? '))
    if hotel.lower() == yes:
        room = float(input('Dollar Amount? '))



sum = travel (room + plane + car)
print('This is the total amount that it may cost you, ' + travel  '!')

<h2>Problem 1</h2>
<p>Fix your indentation. Python uses indentation to define what block code is executed in (i.e. in an <code>if</code> statement, or after it). Here's what you should do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select all (cmd / ctrl + a), and then keep pressing (cmd / ctrl + [) to de-indent. Do this until nothing is indented.</li>
<li>On any line you want in an if / else statement, press the TAB key at the start of that line.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problem 2</h2>
<p>The <code>input</code> function (which gets user input) returns a string. You then try to compare this to an undefined variable <code>yes</code>. Replace the <code>yes</code> in your <code>if</code> statements with <code>"yes"</code> or <code>'yes'</code> to ensure you are comparing two strings.</p>
<h2>Problem 3</h2>
<p>Remember to end <strong>all</strong> of your strings, with a closing quotation mark. You forgot one printing "Thank You" after the "Would you need a flight?" question.</p>
<p>Replace: <code>print('Thank you.)</code> with <code>print('Thank you.')</code></p>
<h2>Problem 4</h2>
<p>Second-to-last line, you define <code>sum</code>, which is never used. Then, you try to use the undefined <code>travel</code> function to add up your three variables. This line of code, in general, makes no sense. I am assuming that you meant this:</p>
<pre><code>travel = (room + plane + car)
</code></pre>
<h2>Problem 5</h2>
<p>You can't concat floats / ints to strings.</p>
<p>This should be the final line:</p>
<pre><code>print('This is the total amout that it is may cost you, '+str(travel)+'!')
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you forgot the concat operator (<code>+</code>) when appending the exclamation mark.</p>
<h2>Final Code:</h2>
<p>Here is the working version of your code:</p>
<pre><code>print('Would you like a rental car?')
rental = (input('Yes or No? '))
if rental.lower() == 'yes':
    car = float(input('Dollar Amount?'))
else:
    print('Thank You!')


print('Would you need a flight?')
flight = (input('Yes or No '))
if flight.lower() == 'yes':
    plane = float(input('Dollar Amount? '))
else:
    print('Thank You!')

print('Would need a hotel?')
hotel = (input('Yes or No? '))
if hotel.lower() == 'yes':
    room = float(input('Dollar Amount? '))



travel = (room + plane + car)
print('This is the total amout that it is may cost you, ' + str(travel)+  '!')
</code></pre>
<h2>Recommendations:</h2>
<p>This works, but it could be better. Here are a few recommendations, which will help you not only with this project, but also with further ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can combine your <code>print</code> and <code>input</code> functions together, since <code>input</code> basically prints and then waits for input. To format it like you have now, simply include a newline character, <code>\n</code>. For example, instead of</p>
<pre><code>print('Would you like a rental car?')
rental = (input('Yes or No? '))
</code></pre>
<p>you could do</p>
<pre><code>rental = input("Would you like a rental car?\nYes or No?")
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>These lines could actually be simplified further. You don't need to define the variable <code>rental</code>, but instead you can just use its' output directly in the <code>if</code> statement, i.e. </p>
<pre><code>if input("Would you like a rental care?\nYes or No?").lower() == "yes" :
    ...
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Learn to use <code>try</code> / <code>catch</code> statements to catch errors. When entering the amount for a travel expense, the user has to type a number. But what if they type a string instead? Your program would crash. Learn how to use <code>try</code> / <code>catch</code> statements to prevent this from happening (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There's not really much apart from that. These were all just beginners mistakes, and soon you'll be writing good code that works well :D</p>
<p>I was also impressed to see how you handled the "yes" / "no" user input by converting the answers to lower case and then checking them, which is something that a lot of people of your skill level neglect to do.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to StackOverflow! You provided the code and what you expect it to do, and that's a good start. Please also describe the issue that you're having (including full stack trace if you have one).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I learn a lot from your feed back. One thing I am still a little confused about is the indentation. The book I read stated to set the tab to space 4, but it seem that many are say I need to fix it. What is the proper spacing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi! Glad I could help :D You can set your tabs to any amount of spaces that you want, however what matters is what lines you indent, and by how many "tabs". This article (<a href="http://www.annedawson.net/Python_Spaces_Indentation.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">annedawson.net/Python_Spaces_Indentation.html</a>) should clear things up, but feel free to ask me more if you've got more questions.</span>
