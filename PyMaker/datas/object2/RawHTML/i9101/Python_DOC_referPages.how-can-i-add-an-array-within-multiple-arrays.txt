<p>I created a large array that is similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>data = [ [1,2,3], [0,1,3],[1,5,3]]

<p>How can I make it so my new array sums up each individual array as shown?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">List comprehensions</a> are good for this:</p>
<pre><code>[[sum(x)] for x in data] # [[6], [4], [9]]
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common
  applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of
  some operations applied to each member of another sequence or
  iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a
  certain condition.</p>

<p>You're wanting to make a new list where each element is the result of some operations (a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>sum</strong></a> in this case) applied to each member of another sequence or iterable (your list of lists).</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This works.</p>
<pre><code>a = [ [1,2,3], [0,1,3],[1,5,3]]
b = []

for i in a:
  sum = 0
  for j in i:
    sum+=j
  b.append([sum])
print(b)
