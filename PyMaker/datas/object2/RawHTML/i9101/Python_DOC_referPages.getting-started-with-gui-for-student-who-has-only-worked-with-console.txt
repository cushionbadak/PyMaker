<p>So far I have only been taught how to program/script at my school for console programs but wanted to start making some applications with an actual interface other then the command-line, unfortunately I have no idea where to begin. I tried to look it up but all I found were guides on how to "design" them not program them. As such I would like to ask you how exactly should I get started on this, I know this is a rather broad question but just a few links to some study material that can help me get started is enough. The languages I have been taught are Visual Basic and Python but I also know HTML and CSS, I am only slightly familiar with JavaScript.</p>
<p>(Bonus Question: so when looking at the website for Atom.io I saw that the editor was made in JavaScript, node.js, HTML and CSS. I was wondering how did they use HTML and CSS for a desktop app? Also, is it possible to do that without node.js and JavaScript, say for example with Python?)</p>

<p>Recommend begin with:</p>
<p>Visual Basic: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492132.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Windows Forms</a>(have a nice GUI editor, easier than TkInter) </p>
<p>Python: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TkInter</a>(Everything simple with pack()). </p>
<p>About HTML/CSS/JS desktop app use <code>Electron</code> <a href="http://electron.atom.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://electron.atom.io/</a></p>

<p>Given you already know python , you can use python library "Tkinter" to get started.
