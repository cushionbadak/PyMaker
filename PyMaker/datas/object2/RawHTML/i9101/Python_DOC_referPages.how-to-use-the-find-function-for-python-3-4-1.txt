<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import re
sentence = raw_input("Write your sentence here ")
word = raw_input("What word would you like to find the position of?")
for i in re.finditer(word, sentence):
    print i.start(), i.end()
</code></pre>
<p>This works in python 2.7.3 but I need it to work in 3.4. When I run the code in 3.4 it gives <code>"i" as an invalid syntax</code>.</p>
<p>Is there a way of altering the code slightly so that it will work or will a whole new method need to be used instead?</p>
<p>Also the program can't be case sensitive.</p>
<p>Thanks.  </p>

<p>You need to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer">input()</a> instead of <code>raw_input()</code> and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer">print()</a> function to print anything in <code>python 3.x</code>.</p>
<p>The following code works for <code>python 3.x</code>. </p>
<pre><code>import re
sentence = input("Write your sentence here ")
word = input("What word would you like to find the position of? ")
for i in re.finditer(word, sentence):
    print(i.start(), i.end())
</code></pre>
<p>Sample I/O:</p>
<pre><code>Write your sentence here I love asian food, specially indian food.
What word would you like to find the position of? food
13 17
36 40
</code></pre>

<p>Change this:</p>
<pre><code>raw_input -&gt; input
</code></pre>
<p>The difference is that <code>raw_input()</code> does not exist in Python 3.x, while <code>input()</code> does. Actually, the old <code>raw_input()</code> has been renamed to <code>input()</code></p>
<p>Also, <code>print</code> become <code>print()</code> as well.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#raw_input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>raw_input</code></a> is now called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And <code>print</code> is a function now and requires to be called as one: <code>print(…)</code>.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I forgot to mention that I tried changing raw input to just input. The only thing I didn't do was move the print to become a function. Works great now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DaniM you are welcome. if my answer helped you, you can accept it as the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also <code>print</code> is now a function</span>
