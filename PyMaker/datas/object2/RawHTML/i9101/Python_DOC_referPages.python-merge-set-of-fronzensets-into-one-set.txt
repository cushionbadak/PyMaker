<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to merge sets defined in a set and this is what I have now</p>
<pre><code>a = frozenset([1,3,4])
b = frozenset([1,2,3,4,5])
s = set()
s.add(a)
s.add(b)
merged = set(itertools.chain.from_iterable(s))
</code></pre>
<p>In practice, <code>s</code> may contain many frozensets. Is there better ways to do it? It feels like a <code>reduce</code> case, but </p>
<pre><code>from functools import reduce
merged = reduce(|, s)
</code></pre>
<p>doesn't work. </p>
<p>Also</p>
<pre><code>merged = reduce(set.add, s)
</code></pre>
<p>doesn't work because the elements of <code>s</code> are frozensets.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you have more than two frozensets, create a container (e.g., list) of them and apply a union:</p>
<pre><code>listoffrozensets = [a,b,...]
frozenset().union(*listoffrozensets)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You <em>can</em> use reduce, just use the appropriate function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from functools import reduce
&gt;&gt;&gt; frozenset.union
&lt;method 'union' of 'frozenset' objects&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; reduce(frozenset.union, [a,b])
frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You were on the right track with <code>|</code>, but <code>|</code> is an operator in Python, and can't be substituted for a function. But when you want to do that, import the operator!</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import operator
&gt;&gt;&gt; reduce(operator.or_, [a,b])
frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>|</code> as a standalone function is known as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#mapping-operators-to-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>operator.or_</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't make a difference, really,  but just use the method <i>directly</i> from the class without instantiating a useless instance: <code>frozenset.union</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga But of course.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would say this is the "correct" way of doing this. <code>reduce</code> is likely less efficient. Anyway, in Python, <code>reduce</code> is not encouraged. This is the reason it was removed form the <code>built-ins</code> namespace in python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga True, <code>union</code> is about 20% faster than <code>reduce</code>, at least as reported by my <code>%timeit</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just hit into a problem when <code>listoffrozensets=[]</code>, then I got error. But <code>frozenset().union(*[])</code> still works.</span>
