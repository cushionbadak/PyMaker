<p>What does <code>[x[1] for x in sortedAverageList]</code> in the coding above?
What does <code>x[1]</code> mean?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If <code>sortedAverageList</code> is a sequence containing another sequence with at least 2 elements, 
<code>[x[1] for x in sortedAverageList]</code> will give you a list of the second element in each of those sequences.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<pre><code>sortedAverageList  = [[1,2],[5,6],[7,8]]
print ([x[1] for x in sortedAverageList] )
#prints [2,6,8]
</code></pre>
<p>For each of the lists <code>[1,2]</code>, <code>[5,6]</code>, <code>[7,8]</code>, <code>x[1]</code> chooses the respective second element. <code>x[0]</code> would choose the first and <code>x[2]</code> would not work because the lists only have two elements.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>x</code> in <code>[x[1] for x in sortedAverageList]</code> has nothing to do with the <code>x</code> you define in the line above. Instead it is the variable inside the for loop to which the elements of <code>sortedAverageList</code> are repeatedly assigned.</p>
<p>I would recomment to study some <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">basic python tutorial</a> before continuiung with more advanced tasks like plotting.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure why this question has been marked as <i>too broad</i>  or <i>unclear</i>. To me it seems pretty clear and quite narrow. The PO has provided the necessary information and it can be answered in a couple of sentences. I agree that the question is a very basic one, but I haven't found a similar question of which this could be a duplicate. After all, SO is not about closing questions, but about helping other people, independent of the level of programming they currently are on.</span>
