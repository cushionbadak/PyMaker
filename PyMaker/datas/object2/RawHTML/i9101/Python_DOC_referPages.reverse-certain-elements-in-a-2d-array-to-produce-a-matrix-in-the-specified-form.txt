<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have the following code for a list of lists with the intention of creating a matrix of numbers:</p>
<pre><code>grid=[[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[8,9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16,17],[18,19,20,21,22]]
</code></pre>
<p>On using the following code which i figured out would reverse the list, it produces a matrix ...</p>
<pre><code>for i in reversed(grid):
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre><code>[18, 19, 20, 21, 22]
[13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
</code></pre>
<p>I want however, the output to be as below, so that the numbers "connect" as they go up:</p>
<pre><code>[22,21,20,19,18]
[13,14,15,16,17]
[12,11,10,9,8]
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
</code></pre>
<p>Also, for an upvote, I'd be interested in more efficient ways of generating the matrix in the first place. For instance, to generate a 7x7 array  - can it be done using a variable, for instance 7, or 49. Or for a 10x10 matrix, 10, or 100?</p>
<p>UPDATE:
Yes, sorry - the sublists should all be of the same size. Typo above</p>
<p>UPDATE BASED ON ANSWER BELOW</p>
<p>These two lines:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; grid=[[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[8,9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16,17],[18,18,20,21,22]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [lst[::-1] for lst in grid[::-1]]
</code></pre>
<p>produce the following output:</p>
<pre><code>[[22, 21, 20, 18, 18], [17, 16, 15, 14, 13], [12, 11, 10, 9, 8], [7, 6, 5,  4, 3, 2, 1]]
</code></pre>
<p>but I want them to print one line after the other, like a matrix ....also, so I can check the output is as I specified. That's all I need essentially, for the answer to be the answer!</p>

<p>usually 2D matrices are created, manipulated with numpy</p>
<p>then index slicing can reorder rows, columns</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

def SnakeMatrx(n):
    Sq, Sq.shape = np.arange(n * n), (n, n) # Sq matrix filled with a range
    Sq[1::2,:] = Sq[1::2,::-1] # reverse odd row's columns
    return Sq[::-1,:] + 1    # reverse order of rows, add 1 to every entry

SnakeMatrx(5)
Out[33]: 
array([[21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
       [20, 19, 18, 17, 16],
       [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
       [10,  9,  8,  7,  6],
       [ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5]])

SnakeMatrx(4)
Out[34]: 
array([[16, 15, 14, 13],
       [ 9, 10, 11, 12],
       [ 8,  7,  6,  5],
       [ 1,  2,  3,  4]])
</code></pre>
<p>if you really want a list of lists:</p>
<pre><code>SnakeMatrx(4).tolist()
Out[39]: [[16, 15, 14, 13], [9, 10, 11, 12], [8, 7, 6, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4]]
</code></pre>
<p>numpy is popular but not a official Standard Library in Python distributions</p>
<p>of course it can be done with list manipulation</p>
<pre><code>def SnakeLoL(n):
    Sq = [[1 + i + n * j for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)] # Sq LoL filled with a range
    for row in Sq[1::2]:
        row.reverse()     # reverse odd row's columns
    return Sq[::-1][:]    # reverse order of rows
# or maybe more Pythonic for return Sq[::-1][:]
#     Sq.reverse()   # reverse order of rows 
#     return Sq 

SnakeLoL(4)
Out[91]: [[16, 15, 14, 13], [9, 10, 11, 12], [8, 7, 6, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4]]

SnakeLoL(5)
Out[92]: 
[[21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
 [20, 19, 18, 17, 16],
 [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
 [10, 9, 8, 7, 6],

print(*SnakeLoL(4), sep='\n')

<p>You need to reverse the list and also the sub-lists:</p>
<pre><code>[lst[::-1] for lst in grid[::-1]]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>lst[::-1]</code> reverses the list via list slicing, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3940137/6260170">here</a>. </p>
<p>You can visualize the resulting nested lists across multiples lines with <code>pprint</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from pprint import pprint
&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint([lst[::-1] for lst in grid[::-1]])
[[22, 21, 20, 19, 18],
 [17, 16, 15, 14, 13],
 [12, 11, 10, 9, 8],
 [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]]

<span class="comment-copy">The sublists are not of the same lengths. Can that be called a matrix? Or is it typo?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"for an upvote" ? but you can't upvote :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oops sorry - sublists should all be of the same size, 1-7 ..and onwards in groups of 7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is there a reason import numpy as np fails to work on IDLE -ImportError: No module named 'numpy'. Also, as I'm developing for student samples, I don't really want to use numpy in the first place. Really, as the question says, I'd like the quickest way to generate a list of lists (columns and rows) for a specified matrix e.g. 7x7, and display it on the screen as shown</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PythonFish added a "pure python" version, how to print one row of List of Lists per line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks -is there a way to ensure the OUTPUT is evenly laid out so it looks like a matrix (even number of spaces for the bottom row that contain only one integer). ALSO, your version above, on printing, doesn't produce a matrix (output), but a long list. How can I get it to print out visually like a matrix</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PythonFish, I'm not up on formatting but lots of options exist <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=python+print+matrix+align+columns" rel="nofollow noreferrer">google.com/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">could you explain what lst[::-1] does please? Also, I just made an edit above, in terms of how to print this so it is like a matrix.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PythonFish See my edited answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Chris_Rands. However, the pprint command doesn't quite work - what does it do any way? SyntaxError: multiple statements found while compiling a single statement</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PythonFish It does work, are you sure you copied my command correctly? See: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks.
