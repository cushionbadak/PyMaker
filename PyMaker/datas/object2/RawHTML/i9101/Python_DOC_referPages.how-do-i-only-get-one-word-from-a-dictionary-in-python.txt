<p>I'm writing an English to Spanish dictionary in python. I have the user input what they want translated and the my program reads a file I created and print the Spanish equivalent of the word. Currently it just print the whole dictionary. This is probably easy but I am new to this and can't seem to figure it out. Thanks </p>
<pre><code>`# coding: utf-8
s=(input("please enter a word to be translated: "))
file=open("dictionary.txt")
engtospa={}
for s in file:
    aList=s.split()
    b=aList[0:]
    engtospa[s]=aList[1:0]
print(engtospa)

`  
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to specify the key which you want to translate. </p>

for s in file:
    aList=s.split()

    engtospa[s]=aList[1:0]
print(engtospa) # &lt;-- your code

<span class="comment-copy">Indexing a dictionary is a very basic concept, and most likely off-topic for Stack Overflow. I suggest taking a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation on dictionaries</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, you might consider using <code>json</code> instead of a plain text-file.</span>
