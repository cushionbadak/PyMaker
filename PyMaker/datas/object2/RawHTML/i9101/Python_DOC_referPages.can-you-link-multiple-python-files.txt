<p>just a quick question. I have been using Tkinter in python in order to create windows. my code is a bit all over the place when it is one file...
my question is, is it possible to call a window that will be located in a different file.</p>
<p>for example,
Window1.py opens a window, there is a button in that window that should initiate window 2, which is located in Window2.py. does the code physically have to be in the same file for it to work together??</p>
<p>thanks in advance!</p>

<p>The answer to this question is yes.
To link two python files, use:</p>
<p>If you are in python 3, use <code>exec(open(r"example").read())</code></p>
<p>If you are in python 2, use <code>open(r"example")</code></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Note: the python 2 example works both in python 2 and 3</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>They do not need to be in the same file, just simply use their location.
e.g. if I had a program on my desktop, I would use</p>
<p><code>exec(open(r"C:/Users/MyName/Desktop/program").read())</code></p>
<p>Hope I could help you :)</p>
