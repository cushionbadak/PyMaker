<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to see if a date is equal to another date but the second date can be plus or minus 7 days how can I do this?</p>
<p>This is the structure of the code I already have, I just dont know how to finish.</p>
<pre><code> for value, date in zip(asIsValueRow.split()[3:], dateRow.split()[1:]):

            if value == varianceTwo and date == priorProdDate:
</code></pre>
<p>Oh and I'm also checking to see if the value is exactly the same as another value I only need the date to be within 7 days.
and the structure of the dates are:     01/10/2017</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>timedelta</code> as fredriksapps suggests</p>
<pre><code>if priorProdDate - timedelta(days=7) &lt;= date &lt;= priorProdDate + timedelta(days=7):
    # do something with data
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Python timedelta objects will probably be useful. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was thinking of doing something like priorDate.min(7) &lt;= date or date &lt;= priorDate.max(7) but there seems to be no way of doing this. I looked at the timedate module, but nothing seemed to apply to this case.I don't know what kind of function to use. I could compare just days but that doesn't work if its from last month. any other ideas?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh thanks I'll try that.</span>
