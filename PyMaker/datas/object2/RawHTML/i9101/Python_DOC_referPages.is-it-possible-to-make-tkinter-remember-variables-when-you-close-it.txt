<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When i open the program, I want to have the same settings there were when i left.
For instance setting a label to a value and still be that value when i close the program and open it again.
Is this possible in Tkinter?
If so, how would i do it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Store the data to somewhere (a text file, <code>json</code>, <code>pickle</code> or something else) and load it during startup.</p>
<p>So your program may look like this:</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter import *
import os

tk=Tk()
var=StringVar()
Entry(tk,textvariable=var).pack()

# load the text before startup
if os.path.isfile('save.txt'):
    with open('save.txt','r') as f:
        var.set(f.read())

mainloop()

# save the text after shutdown
with open('save.txt','w') as f:
    f.write(var.get())
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure! Just save the settings data in a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pickle</a> file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, it's possible. Is that all you need to know?</span>
