<p>This seems pretty simple, but I haven't found a way to do it.  I have three lists, a, b, and c.  I want to iterate over all of them as if their elements altogether form one big list.  I can think of a few ways to do this, but nothing very smooth or "pythonic".  I expected the splat operator to work:</p>
<pre><code>for e in (*a, *b, *c):
   # do stuff with e
</code></pre>
<p>but that gives a syntax error.  Any ideas?</p>

<p>If they are all lists, all tuples, or all strings, then you can concatenate them:</p>
<pre><code>for e in a + b + c:
</code></pre>
<p>For any combination of any iterables, including iterators like generators:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import chain

for e in chain(a, b, c):
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.chain</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, it would work in Python 3.5+. Still, you should use <code>itertools.chain</code>.</span>
