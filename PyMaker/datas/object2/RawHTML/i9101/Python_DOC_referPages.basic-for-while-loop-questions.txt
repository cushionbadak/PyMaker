<p>Very new to python, trying to answer the following questions, but not sure how to approach it so that the loop is doing the work.</p>
<p>Use for loop or while loop to calculate 5!</p>
<p>Use for loop or while loop to calculate ‚àë ùëñ
5
ùëñ=1</p>
<p>Use for loop or while loop to calculate ‚àè ùëò
9
ùëò=3</p>
<p>Use for loop or while loop to calculate ùëÉ3
8</p>
<p>This was my answer for the first one and similar answers for the rest.</p>
<pre><code>for i in range (1,2):
  for_list = [3,4,5]
  sum_values = ((i+1)*i) * for_list[0] * for_list[1] * for_list[2]
  print (sum_values)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To calculate the factorial of any number, you coud defined a function that looks quite similar to this</p>
<pre><code>def factorial(n):
  result = 1
  for i in range(2,n+1):
    result *= i
  return result
</code></pre>
<p>So, to use the above funcion to calulate the factorial of any number, just pass in that number as argument to the function e.g</p>
<pre><code>print(factorial(5)) # 120
</code></pre>
<p>But, if you specifically want to calculate the factorial of 5, you could have a for loop that looks similar to this</p>
<pre><code>result = 1
for i in range(2,6):
  result = result * i

print(result)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Edit your post so its easier to read, there is a <code>code</code> formatter</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry about that, didn't realize it came out like that, I edited it so it should be easier to read, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This isn't actually using a loop for anything, the "loop" here could just as easily be replaced with <code>i = 1</code> and dedenting the "loop" body, and it would still work. The first two problems here should simplify to <code>accumulator = *somebasevalue*</code>, <code>for i in range(1, 6):</code> <code>accumulator *someaccumulatingoperation* i</code>. Note of course, that for non-learning related purposes, you'd just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.factorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>math.factorial</code></a> for #1 and (if I'm reading right) <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code></a> for #2.</span>
