<p>I use a <code>python</code> module and rewrite it for <code>php</code>. I can't understand the meaning of <code>except KeyError</code>. How can implement it in php?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> (The location of last else is a bit strange)</p>
<pre><code>for p1 in primefactors(n):
    try:
        factors[p1] += 1
    except KeyError:
        # when this block runs?
        factors[p1] = 1
</code></pre>
<p>I searched, but couldn't found out. Any idea?</p>

<p>A <code>KeyError</code> exception is raised when trying to naively (ie not using a dictionary's <code>get</code> method) accessing a non existing key in a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>dic = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
print(dic['c'])
# KeyError: 'c'
</code></pre>
<p>In order to catch this exception use <code>try-except</code> that catches <code>KeyError</code>:</p>
<pre><code>dic = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
try:
    print(dic['c'])
except KeyError:
    print("'c' is not in the dictionary")
# 'c' is not in the dictionary
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@KhorneHoly I don't even  understand about <code>KeyError</code>. Sorry, I'm very new in python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace I found that, but couldn't understand the meaning :(</span>
