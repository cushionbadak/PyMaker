<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Identification Code is like GYYMMDD.
G is 1 or 2 which means male or female.
And YYMMDD is Birthday.</p>
<p>I've just written like this :</p>
<pre><code>s=[]
while True:
  while True:
        s = input('Enter 7 numbers : ')
        if len(s) == 7:
            break
        else:
            print('Retype your 7 personal numbers!!')
  if '0' &lt; s[1] &lt; '3':
    break
  else:
    print('retry')
</code></pre>
<p>However, I have no idea to input Birthdaycode into array.</p>
<p>Please enlighten me on the specifics.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The following will put the YY, MM, DD into a single array:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; input_ = "1851803"
&gt;&gt;&gt; birthdarray = [input_[i:i+2] for i in range(1, 6, 2)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; birthdarray = ['85', '18', '03']
</code></pre>
<p>It's evident that you're new to python/programming. However in general, it would be best to start to use functions to verify your input and either accept or reject the user's input; instead of doing it all within  while loops.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There is no <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>array</code></a> in your code. That's a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list</code></a>,</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay. I was confused list and array. Thank you !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your answer and yes, just started to learn from this month. Okay, I write separately.</span>
