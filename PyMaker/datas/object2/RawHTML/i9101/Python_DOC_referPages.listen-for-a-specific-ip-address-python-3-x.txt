<p>I'm searching for a method to get a simple python server to listen for a specific local IP address on my LAN using the socket import (assuming the destination computer has a client script).  <code>socket.bind()</code> and  <code>socket.listen(int)</code> methods cannot provide me with any options for filtering IP addresses. Am I missing a method?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I don't think Python has a built-in method to do that.</p>
<p>However, as WhatsThePoint suggested, you can add your own filtering, as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.recvfrom" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>socket.recvfrom()</code></a> will give you the client address, compare it with your required address, and if it's wrong, throw away the data.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Can't you just once you get a connection inspect the IP address and if it is not the desired one, immediately drop it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>while True: if CurrentIPAddress != SpecIPAddress: #drop connection</code></span>
