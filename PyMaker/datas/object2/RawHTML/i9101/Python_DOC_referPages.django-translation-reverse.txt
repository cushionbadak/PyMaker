<p>Is it possible to get msgid from msgstr?</p>
<p>Suppose I have</p>
<pre><code>msgid "Table"
msgstr "Tisch"
</code></pre>
<p>If active language is German is there any function to execute <code>inverse_ugettext('Tisch') -&gt; Table</code>?</p>

<p>No, it's not <em>trivially</em> possible. At least not with the django i18n implementation (which uses python's gettext).</p>
<p>If you <strong>really</strong> need this, you'll have to manually implement it somehow (<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b204540be475922c5cb2ee2adc7caa3dadcca33c/Lib/gettext.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the gettext source</a> might be a useful starting place).</p>
<p>If speed is not critical here (eg: it's a very infrequent operation), you might want to parse the <code>.po</code> files, which are a lot simpler to parse, and find the reverse there.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Not as far as I know. Django's translation uses GNU gettext, and the python implementation is in the standard library. There's no <i>reverse</i> functionality as far as I can find. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html#gnu-gettext-api" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html#gnu-gettext-api</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Most likely you're having a <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/66378">XY problem</a> here. What do you actually want to achieve?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK. Thank you very much.</span>
