<p>I've followed <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2016.3/configuring-folders-within-a-content-root.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pycharm documentation</a> to set up the IDE to resolve imports. However it seems that each folder containing *.py files needs to be explicitly added as 'sources root' in order for the IDE to resolve all references. Can this be done recursively from a root folder?</p>
<p>Is this the correct way to get the IDE to resolve all codebase references, or have I not set up my project structure correctly?</p>
<p>I have already followed other methods for resolving references in the IDE <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20479696/pycharm-unresolved-reference-error-on-the-ide-when-opening-a-working-project">here</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21236824/unresolved-reference-issue-in-pycharm">here</a> but to no avail. It seems that the IDE will only resolve them if I manually add each folder as a 'sources root'. Without the recursive functionality, large codebases will be laborious when setting up the IDE!</p>

<p>If you have not used <code>__init__.py</code>, you should add it in each sub-directory to mark it as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages" rel="nofollow noreferrer">package</a>. By adding it, Python will treat the directories as containing packages making you modules visible to other directories and therefore able to be imported.</p>
