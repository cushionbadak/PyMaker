<p>I need to print out the index position of the highest value of a list on its first instance.</p>
<p>What I have at the moment:</p>
<pre><code>temperatures = [4.7, 3, 4.8, -1, 4.8, 4]
# set best_index to 0
best_index = 0
# for each position from 1 to length of list:
for position in range(0, len(temperatures)):
    if position &gt; best_index:
        best_index = position           
# print best_position
print(temperatures[best_position])
</code></pre>
<p>However, with the above code I don't get what I am looking for, as with that example list I'd get the result of 4 and not 2 as it should be.</p>
<p>What am I doing horribly wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're doing a few things wrong.  First, you are checking if the new <em>index</em> is larger than the previous <em>index</em>, you're not checking the actual values.  Second, you're printing out the actual value at the index rather than the index itself.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You are not testing the temperatures, only an arbitrary incrementing integer. <code>position</code> is just <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, etc. Think about this a little longer; how would you compare the <i>actual temperatures</i>? You only need to replace the <code>if position &gt; best_index:</code> test here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate</a> could help you a lot. combined with <i>max</i> you could do it in one line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CristiFati: see the duplicate, there are faster and better methods. I don't think the OP is quite ready for <code>enumerate()</code> just yet, though. The duplicate is there because that's the canonical answer for the underlying problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Shortest: <code>temperatures.index(max(temperatures))</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you all for your help, it's been really useful. Apologies for opening a duplicate!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is rather a comment.</span>
