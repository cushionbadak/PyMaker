<p>I have long-running python programs that do not have sufficient internal logging. I'd like to be able to attach to a running python program and find out it's current line number. Ideally, I'd like to do this without interrupting its execution, but I'm happy to have it pause, print the stack t race, and then keep going.</p>
<p>I could easily type control-C, but that would kill the program.</p>
<p>Is there any way to do this?</p>

<p>Seems like <a href="https://github.com/benfred/py-spy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">py-spy</a> is what you are looking for.</p>
<p>It can connect to running process without modifying and show what it currently do.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you're fine with debugging kind of approach, try out pdb -  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. <code>pdb</code> works great if you launch the program under pdb, but it doesn't look like it can attach to a running python program or perform introspection.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">py-spy it is! Thanks!</span>
