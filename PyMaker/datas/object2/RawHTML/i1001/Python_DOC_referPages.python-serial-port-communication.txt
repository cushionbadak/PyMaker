<p>Here is my code for serial port communication </p>
<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
from matplotlib import style


import serial
MCU = serial.Serial('COM35', 115200, timeout=.1)


import time
time.sleep(1) #give the connection a second to settle

while True:

print(str(data))

<p>but i'm getting in the <strong>output</strong> as </p>
<p><code>b'\x0b\x16 )6\x06\x07\x08X\x02\x16,'</code>     (it's Hex+Ascii value) </p>
<p>and this is my <strong>input data</strong> </p>
<p><code>uint8_t myBuf[]={11,22,32,41,54,6,7,8,88,2,22,44};</code></p>
<p>any one know what i'm doing wrong here? </p>

<p>What format do you want your output in? As you suggest, what you have is the correct data but in byte format. For example you could get it as a list of python ints as follows (Python 3):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; list(data)
[11, 22, 32, 41, 54, 6, 7, 8, 88, 2, 22, 44]
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">struct</a> module may also be useful for you in decoding byte data.</p>
<p>(I can't leave a comment, sorry.)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you wrote str(data) you requested python to tranlsate the binary data to a readable string (In a readable fromat).</p>
<p>Since there is no readable representation to most of the bytes python just translates them into their hex representation (as a string).</p>
<p>If you want to print them as a list just: list(data).</p>
