<p>Why has os.linesep() been used here in my code?</p>

<p>I don't know why you're using it, but from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.linesep" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The string used to separate (or, rather, terminate) lines on the current platform. This may be a single character, such as '\n' for POSIX, or multiple characters, for example, '\r\n' for Windows.</p>

<p>Basically represents the current line separator default for your current environment or platform.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't know, why <i>was</i> <code>os.linesep</code> used in your code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The line separator character(s) differ between OSs. This way the code is OS-independent.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MichaelButscher: Line ending translation happens by default, and <code>print</code> prints a line ending by default, so using <code>os.linesep</code> here doesn't make things any more OS-independent. I think this code may actually produce <code>\r\r\n\r\n</code> on Windows.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112, You are right. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And the part of the quote you took out: "Do not use os.linesep as a line terminator when writing files opened in text mode (the default); use a single '\n' instead, on all platforms." This includes printing to stdout with <code>print</code>. Also, <code>print</code> already prints a line ending by default anyway.</span>
