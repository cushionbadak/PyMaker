<p>Is it possible to create lists without specifying how many items are going to be in it?</p>
<p>At the start of my code, I create all the lists I want to populate by using:</p>
<pre><code>lot_list = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
lowest_list = ["0","0","0","0","0","0","0"]
highest_list = ["0","0","0","0","0","0","0"]
</code></pre>
<p>These lists can store 7 items so, if I want to store 8 items, I am having to add a new ,“0” to each list each time if I want the code to add an 8th item later. </p>
<p>Is there a way to not have to specify the list size at the start? Or some kind of dynamic list where it doesn’t matter?</p>

<p>The other answers already mention that lists in python are dynamic, so you can specify an empty list and append to it. </p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">other operations are supported</a>, such as insert <code>list.insert(i, x)</code> (inserts an element at a given position), which allows you place an element anywhere in the array, not just at the end.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In python when you define list you don't need to define size, or a type. And if you like you can mix and match. (i.e. list with int, string, and complex data types)</p>
<pre><code>list_a=[]

for i in range(1,100):
    list_a.append(i)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Python lists are dynamic, and can hold any number of items. For example, if this was your code:</p>
<pre><code>mylist = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

for i in range(7):
    mylist[i] = i ** 2
</code></pre>
<p>You could modify it to look like this:</p>
<pre><code>mylist = []

for i in range(7):
    mylist.append(i ** 2)
</code></pre>
<p>In fact, you could do <code>for i in range(1000)</code> and it would be fine. A way to shorten the above is a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>mylist = [i ** 2 for i in range(7)]
</code></pre>
<p>which would do the same.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Lists are dynamic, you can <code>.append()</code> to them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"unlike other languages (i.e. JAVA)"  you are assuming that java has no dynamic list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RoadRunner yes, I meant array and not list. and so I removed that statment.</span>
