<p>I notice that I can do this and get away with it, at least at first glance:</p>
<p><code>from pprint import pprint as print</code></p>
<p>Convenient. But I have a bad feeling about this. What sort of grue is going to eat me if I try this in a nontrivial program?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Beware that <code>pprint</code> is meant for dumping Python data structures, as it always prints the output of the <code>__repr__</code> method of each object in the data structures pass to it, and is therefore not very suitable as a replacement to <code>print</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = '''Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea"'''
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(b)
Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea"
&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint(b)
'Hemingway\'s "The Old Man and the Sea"'
</code></pre>
<p>So if you replace the built-in <code>print</code> function with <code>pprint</code> and want to print some readable messages, you would find the output looking funny with all these unintended quotes and escape sequences.</p>

<p>Nothing will explode, because this import will only change your local <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/this.py#L21" rel="nofollow noreferrer">namespace</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may go ahead and do it, without fear of breaking other namespaces or being eaten by grues.</p>
<p>Do be aware, however, that the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html#pprint.pprint" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pprint</code> call signature</a> is different from <code>print</code>, so it's possible some <code>print</code> lines within the containing module may need to be adjusted.  My recommendation is to import it under the usual name, <code>pprint</code>, and use the find/replace features of your text editor to change existing <code>print</code> calls accordingly.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">They don't have the same API, <i>any</i> use of print that isn't just a single argument will choke. Multiple arguments, using sep and end, ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean, it will only affect the module you imported from...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean... You say nothing bad will happen and then explain how something bad could happen and how to avoid it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm, no, I can't agree with that - nothing bad will happen. Name shadowing is a <i>feature</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's a feature that has consequences. OP was asking about what those consequences were. You started your answer with "Nothing". Which just seemed, to me, a strange way to introduce an explanation of what the consequences were.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am charitably assuming all the prints in OP's module are data structures such as dicts and the OP actually wants them pretty-printed. "Nothing" was intended to contract "Nothing (will explode if you overwrite the name print)", have edited to that effect...</span>
