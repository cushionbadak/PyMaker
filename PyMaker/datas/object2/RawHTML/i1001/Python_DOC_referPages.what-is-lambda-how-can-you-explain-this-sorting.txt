<p>Please be gentle I'm still learning Python. I've an example where </p>
<blockquote>
<p>pairs = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (4, 'four')]</p>
<p>pairs.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[1])</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you please help explain why this is the sequence?</p>

<p>A lambda is simply a short way of declaring a simple function. That code could just as easily have been written:</p>
<pre><code>pairs = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (4, 'four')]

def key_func(pair):
    return pair[1]

pairs.sort(key=key_func)
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the lambda function is telling <code>sort</code> how it should turn a value in the array (in this case, a tuple which doesn't have an obvious sorting order) into a value that it knows how to sort (a string).</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>lambda</code> is the same as an unnamed function, i.e. <code>def f(pair): return pair[1]</code>.  You will do well to brush up on the vast documentations and tutorials on beginner basics of Python before venturing further...</span>

<span class="comment-copy"><i>All</i> functions are anonymous; the <code>def</code> statement simply binds the function to a name after it has been defined. A <code>lambda</code> expression is an expression (rather than a statement) that can create a function as long as the body of the function is itself a single expression.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Adding to what was already said : you are establishing a criteria on how to sort. The lambda function returns the second element for each tuple. Therefore, you are sorting by the second element of your tuples.</span>
