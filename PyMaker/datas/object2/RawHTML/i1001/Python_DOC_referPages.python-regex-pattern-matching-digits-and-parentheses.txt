<p>I would like to know how I can possibly get/match a list of digist ending with a list of digits in parentheses?</p>
<p><strong>Original text</strong></p>
<p>Cisco IOS Software, 3600 Software (C3660-JK9S2-M), Version 12.4(25b)<strong>strong text</strong>, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)
ROM: 3600 Software (C3660-JK9S2-M), Version 12.4(25b), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)</p>
<p><strong>Expected match</strong></p>
<pre><code>12.4(25b)
</code></pre>
<p>Below is what I tried, but it doesn't work or get the specific version</p>
<pre><code>^\d.*\)$ 
^[0-9].*\)$
Version\s\d.*\)
Version \d{2}.*\)$
</code></pre>
<p>Any idea?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Try this: <code>.*Version (.*?\)).*</code>. This expression should work regardless of if the number in the brackets in followed by a letter or not. You then fetch the result (the version number part) by using <code>\1</code> as a 'variable'. In python, you do it using the <code>group()</code> function from the result. Check beforehand if anything was matched at all for safety.</p>
<p>Full example code:</p>
<pre><code>import re

show = 'Cisco IOS Software, 3600 Software (C3660-JK9S2-M), Version 12.4(25b)strong text, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1) ROM: 3600 Software (C3660-JK9S2-M), Version 12.4(25b), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)'
regexoutput = re.search('.*Version (.*?\)).*', show)

if regexoutput:
    print(regexoutput.group(1))
</code></pre>
<p>To obtain multiple version numbers (i.e. both instances of the numbers after the 'Version' string, one can use <code>regexoutput = re.findall('Version (.*?\))',show)</code>. Here, a list is returned and the group will be automatically fetched by definition (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall</a>), so the check at the end is not needed.</p>

<p>May this working:
<code>\d+\.\d+\(\d+.\)</code>
result:

<p>any problem leave ur comment pls.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks but doesn't filter specific version.. it gets all version output but end with ).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@searching1 What exactly do you mean? For me, the output looks like this (notice the green part): <a href="https://imgur.com/1nnL8tY" rel="nofollow noreferrer">imgur.com/1nnL8tY</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Code: regexoutput = re.search('.*Version (.*?)).*',show)                                       Output: 'sh ver | i Software\r\nCisco IOS Software, 3600 Software (C3660-JK9S2-M), 12.4(25b), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nROM: 3600 Software (C3660-JK9S2-M), 12.4(25b), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nlab.switch01'  Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@searching1 I updated my answer. As mentioned before, you have to grab the group (which is the result you get inside the brackets I added). A bracket in regex without a preceeding backslash, i.e. <code>(</code> instead of <code>\(</code>, has a different meaning. Look up the explanation on regex groups to learn more.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your help man.. looks OK now... Will take note of that and I review. More things to learn.. 1 issue has been resolved and twice the issue pops up. :) lol</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your inputs.. Sorry I forgot to mention that there are multiple serial # which like this Version 15.0(1)M, Version 12.4(25b), on thing in common both version end with , comma.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also what tool are you using to test the regex pattern? is that the built in software in mac?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So, u want output <code>Version 15.0(1)M, Version 12.4(25b)</code> the whole string or just <code>["15.0(1)", "12.4(25b)"]</code>ï¼ŸI'm using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">VSCode</a> on Mac.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In my case there are a lot of serial number that I need to pullout. so I just need this for ex. 15.0(1)M &amp; 15.0(1)M.. Thanks</span>
