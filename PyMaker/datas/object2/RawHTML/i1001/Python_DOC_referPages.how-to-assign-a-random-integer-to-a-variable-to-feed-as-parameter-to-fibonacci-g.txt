<p>I want to print a <strong>fibonacci sequence</strong> up to a random number. First I defined a variable (<code>nterm</code>) and assigned an integer number to it. It is actually the range to which the program will print a <strong>fibonacci sequence</strong>. <br/> I want to do it by generating a random number, so I included the random library with <code>import random</code>. Here a random number is generated but I want to assign that number to <code>nterms</code> (a variable).<br/> How can I assign a random number to <code>nterms</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import random
print(random.randint(0,5))
 # Here a random number should be generated and should be used as nterms           

    n1 = 0
    n2 = 1
    count = 0
    if nterms &lt;= 0:
       print("Please enter a positive integer")
    elif nterms == 1:
       print("Fibonacci sequence upto",nterms,":")
       print(n1)
    else:
       print("Fibonacci sequence upto",nterms,":")
       while count &lt; nterms:
           print(n1,end=' , ')
           nth = n1 + n2
           n1 = n2
           n2 = nth
           count += 1
</code></pre>
<p><br/> <strong>For example:</strong> the random number generated is 5 so it should be equal to nterms. 
<br/> If <code>nterms = 5</code> the expected output should be <code>0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 ,</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your code you are not assigning any value to <code>nterms</code>.
You should assign it like the following:</p>
<pre><code>nterms = random.randint(0,5)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>nterms = random.randint(0,5)
</code></pre>
<p>This is simply how you can assign a random number in variable and pass it later. Any more questions, let me know. 
edit:</p>
<p>Like patrick said, the format of this is <code>nterms =random.randint(lowestvalue,biggestvalue)</code></p>
<p>So you can add the range of the numbers you want to test with, in that case you <strong>do not</strong> have to check if it is less than zero in your code, </p>
<pre><code>  if nterms &lt;= 0:
       print("Please enter a positive integer")
</code></pre>
<p>because it will never be less than zero, if you enter two positive numbers as the lowest and biggest values. :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If your question is about <code>How can a assign a random number to nterms using random library.</code> ... why all the rest of the code and text ? use <code>nterm = random.randint(lowestvalue,biggestvalue)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">your current code uses variable assignment all over the place ... maybe it is some code you "found"? in that case you might profit from learning a bit more about python - start here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to assign it to <code>nterms</code> so it's a little more clear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You want to say that i should write it as nterms=random.randint (0,5)</span>
