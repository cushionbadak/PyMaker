<p>I'm trying to skip blacklisted items when working with my Selenium Python program, but I can't figure out how to make this snippet work - </p>
<pre><code>    channel = driver.find_element_by_xpath('/html/body/ytd-app/div[1]/ytd-page-manager/ytd-watch-flexy/div[3]/div[1]/div/div[7]/div[3]/ytd-video-secondary-info-renderer/div/div[2]/ytd-video-owner-renderer/a').get_attribute('aria-label')

    print(channel)   
    print(blacklistchannels[3])

    if channel in blacklistchannels:
        print('Blacklisted Channel, Skipping...')
        continue
    else:
        print('There is still a problem')
</code></pre>
<p>Even though when printed, the the channel name and blacklisted item (3) are exactly the same. It still follows the else, and prints out "there is still a problem" </p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!</p>
<p>Edit - The continue there is irrelevant to the snippet, it's just for continuing a loop this is in.</p>
<p>Solution - .Stripping() the blacklist and Channel name, to get rid of the whitespaces and /n I had for the newlines.</p>

<p>Pretty tough to guess the reason why <code>else()</code> block gets executed. Perhaps the relevant <em>HTML</em> would have helped us to diagnose the issue.</p>
<p>However I suspect <em>value</em> extracted by <code>get_attribute('aria-label')</code> contains <em>blank spaces</em> / <em>white spaces</em>.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>You can use <em>python</em>'s <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_strip.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>strip()</code></a> method to remove the <em>blank spaces</em> / <em>white spaces</em> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>channel = driver.find_element_by_xpath('/html/body/ytd-app/div[1]/ytd-page-manager/ytd-watch-flexy/div[3]/div[1]/div/div[7]/div[3]/ytd-video-secondary-info-renderer/div/div[2]/ytd-video-owner-renderer/a').get_attribute('aria-label').strip(' \n')
print(channel)   
print(blacklistchannels[3])
if channel in blacklistchannels:
    print('Blacklisted Channel, Skipping...')
else:
    print('There is still a problem')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>why not just use this?</p>
<pre><code>channel = driver.find_element_by_xpath('/html/body/ytd-app/div[1]/ytd-page-manager/ytd-watch-flexy/div[3]/div[1]/div/div[7]/div[3]/ytd-video-secondary-info-renderer/div/div[2]/ytd-video-owner-renderer/a').get_attribute('aria-label')

print(channel)   
print(blacklistchannels[3])

if channel in blacklistchannels:
    print('Blacklisted Channel, Skipping...')
    # continue
else:
    print('There is still a problem')
</code></pre>
<p>Im not sure why you are using continue in an <code>if</code> statement</p>

<p>Just a side note on how to catch issues like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "hello\r\n"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(a)
hello

&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>As you can tell, it is easy to over look the "\r\n" with a normal print statement.</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr" rel="nofollow noreferrer">repr()</a> is helpful:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "hello\r\n"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(repr(a))
'hello\r\n'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It's clearly not exactly the same but we can't see any of the data. Please show both <code>channel</code> and <code>blacklistedchannel</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Update the question with relevant HTML</span>
<span class="comment-copy">they arent the same - probably whitespaces or else. Make a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> to get help - this code is too vague.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">At a <i>guess</i>, <code>channel</code> is in some container e.g. a list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would look at this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14312869/syntaxerror-continue-not-properly-in-loop" title="syntaxerror continue not properly in loop">stackoverflow.com/questions/14312869/â€¦</a> , also, why are you using 'continue'?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just noticed that the 2nd print (the one from the list) has a blank line under it. This made me realise that it was probably a /n I was printing into the text file to make new lines. How would I go about stripping the entire list of /n's?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Checkout the updated answer and let me know the status.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>blacklistchannels = [x.strip('\n') for x in blacklistchannels]</code> but it may be easier to strip the newline as the data is being put into the list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use <code>print(repr(blacklistchannels[3]))</code> to see what is there with no formatting done.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DebanjanB Thanks, figured it out on my own. There aren't any whitespaces in the aria-label, the problem is in fact the /n's inserted for the new lines from my text file. Just for looped the list and stripped them into another list, works great now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Check the edit I made...</span>
