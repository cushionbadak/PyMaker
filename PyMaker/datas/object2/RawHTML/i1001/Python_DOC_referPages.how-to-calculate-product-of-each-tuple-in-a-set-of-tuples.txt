<p>Write a Python function called <code>minProd</code>, which takes as an argument a
  set of tuples of integers, calculates the product of the values in
  each tuple, and returns the smallest such product. (Note that the
  tuples may contain negative numbers, so the smallest product could be
  less than 0.) If any of the tuples is empty its product should be
  treated as 1; if the set is empty the value None should be returned. [
  The product of the values in a tuple is obtained by multiplying all of
  them together, e.g. the product of the numbers in the tuple
  <code>(3,7,2,3)</code> is 3x7x2x3 which evaluates to 126. ]</p>

<p>Here is some answer:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
def minProd(tupleSet):
    return (
        min(map(lambda x: np.prod(x) if len(x) &gt; 0 else 1, tupleSet)) 
        if len(tupleSet) &gt; 0

<p>Lets look into decomposition of the problem, and simplify it down to standard python library.</p>
<p>We have iterable of tuples, and we need to find minimum product.</p>
<ol>
<li>From iterable of tuples, create iterable of products</li>
<li>Find minimum value of that iterable</li>
</ol>
<p>2nd one is easy part â€“ use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>min</code></a>.</p>
<p>Lets decompose 1st part:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have iterable, every element of each is tuple</li>
<li>Iterate over elements and apply some function that transforms tuple
into single value by multiplying all elements</li>
<li>Write or find function that takes tuple if integers and return product</li>
</ol>
<p>Every single step is easy to find solution for.</p>
<p>Multiplying elements from iterable can be done with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html?highlight=reduce#functools.reduce" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>reduce</code></a> + <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.mul" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>mul</code></a>. <code>reduce</code> supports "initializer" out of the box, so requirement for "empty tuple should result to 1" is covered.</p>

<p>Without using <code>numpy</code>:</p>
<h2>Code</h2>
<pre><code>from functools import reduce
from operator import mul

def minProd(l):
    if l:
        return min((reduce(mul, e, 1) for e in l))

print(minProd([(3,4), ()]))
print(minProd([(1,2,3,4,455), (-40696, 986845)]))
print(minProd([]))
</code></pre>
<h2>Output</h2>

<p>If you are using <code>numpy</code>, you can do:</p>
<pre><code>def minProd(l):
  if l:
      return np.min(np.prod(l, axis=-1))
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>inp</code> is the input (the set of lists you want to process)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried many things but as I am new to python, I find it difficult to understand ... Im not asking for the solution of the Question Im just asking for a hint on how to calculate a product at a time and store it in a set .... for example : def minProd(x): prod=1  for i in x : for z in i : prod= prod * z   print(prod)  minProd({(1,2),(3,4)})  Here I get the product for all tuples but I only need 2 and 12 separately and I don't get how it can be done</span>
