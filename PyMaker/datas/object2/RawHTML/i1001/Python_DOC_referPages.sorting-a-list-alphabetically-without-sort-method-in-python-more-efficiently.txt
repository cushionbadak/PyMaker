<p>I'm working on a python project where a string needs to be read from a file, sorted alphabetically, and written into another file. </p>
<p>I have a working program already, but it is inefficient and I would like to know how to improve it. </p>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>def sorter(list):

    for i in range(len(list)):                                 
        for j in range(len(list) - 1 ):                         
            if list[j] &gt; list[j + 1]:
               list[j], list[j + 1] = list[j + 1], list[j]     

    return list

def main():

    infile = open( 'text.txt', 'r' )   
    data = infile.read()               
    list = data.split()               

    newList = []                        
    for item in list:
        newList.append(item.lower())

    sorter(newList)                    

    with open( 'text2.txt', 'w' ) as f:  
        for item in newList:             
            f.write(" " + item)  

main()    
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A few things:</p>
<p>Reading lines from a file can be done more succinctly just by using <code>f.readlines()</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects</a>).</p>
<p>Separately you should <code>with</code> on both files so that you free up resources you no longer need:</p>
<pre><code>def main():

    with open( 'text.txt', 'r' ) as infile:
        data = infile.read().split()

    with open( 'text2.txt', 'w' ) as f:  
        for item in sorted(data):
            f.write(" " + item)  

main()
</code></pre>
<p>This implementation, however, requires reading the entire file in memory. If you need to consume a truly massive amount (gigabytes) of data, you're probably better off with a more complicated approach.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide an example string that needs sorting, and what you expect the output of said example to be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could implement quicksort or mergesort.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you use built in functions? sorted(list, key=str.lower)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the purpose of the <code>for i in range(...)</code> I don't see <code>i</code> used anythere else. Also you need to assign the output of sorter to newlist in your code, it's doing nothing right now.  Also what's the reason for adding a space to every line in the last for loop?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jaba He's writing a bubblesort, he just wants to do the operation in the <code>for j in range(...)</code> N times so that's why he has the <code>for i</code>. And he doesn't have to assign the output of sorter to newlist, sorter is modifying the list in place.</span>
