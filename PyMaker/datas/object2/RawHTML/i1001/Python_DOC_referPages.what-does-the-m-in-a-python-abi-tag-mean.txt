<p>PEP 425 explains the compatibility tag format for built python distributions, but does not explain the ABI tag in full detail.</p>
<p>The ABI tag can end with a combination of the letters 'd', 'm', and 'u'. As an example, it is explained within the PEP that the 'd' means an ABI with debugging, and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46839079/318877">this answer</a> explains that the 'u' denotes an interpreter compiled with <code>--enable-unicode=ucs4</code>, but I could not find the meaning of the 'm' anywhere.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Per <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3149/" rel="noreferrer">PEP 3149</a>, <code>m</code> indicates that the ABI in question is using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/memory.html#pymalloc" rel="noreferrer">the <code>pymalloc</code> allocator</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Python implementations MAY include additional flags in the file name tag as appropriate. For example, on POSIX systems these flags will also contribute to the file name:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--with-pydebug</code> (flag: <code>d</code>)</li>
<li><code>--with-pymalloc</code> (flag: <code>m</code>)</li>
<li><code>--with-wide-unicode</code> (flag: <code>u</code>)</li>
</ul>
