<p>Below is the solution for the celebrity problem.</p>
<p>The problem: Suppose you are at a party with n people (labeled from 0 to n - 1) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other n - 1 people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.</p>
<p>Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).</p>
<pre><code>def knows(a,b): //Function that returns 1 if a knows b else returns 0

people = [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]
for i in range(0,4):
        for j in range(0,4):
            if(people[a][b]==1):
                return 1
            else:
                return 0


 a = 0
 c=0
 for b in range(1,4):
        if(knows(a,b)):
             c=b

 for i in range(0,4):
        if((i!=c) &amp; (knows(i,c)) | (knows(c,i))!=1): //1
               print c
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to know how <code>//1</code> gets executed. In the above case, 0 is the celebrity. Hence c = 0. So in the 2nd iteration:</p>
<pre><code>i = 1
c = 0
i!=c //Since 1!=0, its true so we get 1
knows(1,0) //1 knows 0 hence return value : 1
knows(0,1) //0 doesn't know 1 hence return value : 0
</code></pre>
<p>So <code>//1</code> will be :</p>
<pre><code>if (1 &amp; 1 | 1):
    print c 
</code></pre>
<p>Here c should be printed but it doesn't get printed and it goes to the next iteration.</p>

    # if x1 &amp; x2 | x3!=1: # note !=

<span class="comment-copy">It does work. There's something else up with your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It prints 0 only once when i=0.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or alternatively use the logical operators <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>; then you can leave out the parentheses.</span>
