<p>The following code:</p>
<pre><code>text = "I'm a string that contains this characters {}, [], ()"
slice = "this characters {}, [], ()"
print([ (m.start(0), m.end(0)) for m in re.finditer(slice, text) ])
</code></pre>
<p>Shows the error "re.error: unterminated character set at position 12", 
That it's, most likely, because of the metacharacters "{}, [], ()". Is there any regular expression that can make finditer ignore it?</p>

<p>You must escape the special characters in your regex:</p>

<p>Note that only the opening brace and square bracket need an escape, but both parentheses.</p>
