<p>I have an instance variable from a class and I want to execute some code when there is a change in my variable. </p>
<p>I'm aware of the property and Observer pattern event handling but I don't think it helps in my case. </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<pre><code>class Thing:
  def __init__(self):
      self.thing = []
      self.thing2 = ""
  def code_that_executes(self):
      self.thing2 = self.thing[0]
s = Thing()
s.thing.append("Something") #The event 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can implement <strong>setattr</strong> on your class. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.A = 5
    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        if name == "A":
            print("A has changed to: {0}".format(value))
</code></pre>
Now when you have an object `foo = Foo()` and call `foo.bar = 5` you get the result:

<pre><code>bar changed to 5
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setattr__" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.<strong>setattr</strong></a> </p>
<p>Note:This will print during the <strong>init</strong> call as well.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">this question needs more context; what framework are you using if any? is this a script or part of an application? is the 'event' you're referring to generated client side or server side?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what about adding the event in def append of Thing1, so when you call append("Something") it executes?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PyNoob I'm not using a framework and I think i misused the word "event". The event in this case is when the instance variable self.thing appends. I'll change the example so that it narrows down to what I want.</span>
