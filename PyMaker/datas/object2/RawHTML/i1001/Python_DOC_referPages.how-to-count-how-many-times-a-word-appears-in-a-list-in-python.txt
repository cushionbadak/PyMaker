<p>I have the following list in python</p>
<pre><code>texts = [
    ["great", "even", "for", "the", "non", "runner", "this", "sound",
     "track", "was", "brilliant"],
    ["cannot", "recommend", "as", "a", "former", "comrade", "i", "did",
     "not", "want", "to", "have", "to", "do", "this"]
]
</code></pre>
<p>and I want to go through the list and count how often each word appears in it.</p>
<p>I have tried counting the individual words using <code>length()</code> and I get a <code>2</code> as a result which means it does not work.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can count how often a word appears in a list as I intend storing the counted word in a new list and it's frequency in another list.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance </p>

<p>First thing to note is probably that <code>texts</code> is a nested list, which is also why you get <code>2</code> for <code>len(texts)</code> since <code>texts</code> contains 2 sublists.</p>
<p>If you want to iterate over the individual words, you need to iterate over the sublists and then over the words inside the sublists. Luckily, Python's list comprehensions can be nested:</p>
<pre><code>[word for words in texts for word in words]
</code></pre>
<p>As for the counting: The standard library has a dictionary class for exactly such purpose: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">collections.Counter</a>:</p>
<pre><code>word_counts = collections.Counter(word for words in texts for word in words)
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you a dictionary mapping individual words to their occurrence count.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One liner:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
from itertools import chain

texts = [["a", "b"], ["a", "c"]]

words_count = Counter(chain(*texts))
print(words_count)

&gt;&gt; Counter({'a': 2, 'b': 1, 'c': 1})
