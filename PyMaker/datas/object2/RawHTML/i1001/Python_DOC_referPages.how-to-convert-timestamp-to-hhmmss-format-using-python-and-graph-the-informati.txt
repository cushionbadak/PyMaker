<p>I am trying to use timestamp information to graph. 
However, when I convert the number into hh:mm:ss. It does not work.</p>
<p>I have tried this:</p>
<pre><code> timestamp = [dt.strptime(str(datetime.timedelta(seconds=round(t/1000))),'%H:%M:%S') for t in timestamp1]
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hrz5m.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hrz5m.png"/></a></p>
<p>Also I tried this 
    timestamp = [dt.strftime(dt.strptime(str(datetime.timedelta(seconds=round(t / 1000))), '%H:%M:%S'), '%H:%M:%S') for t in timestamp]</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHDS5.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eHDS5.png"/></a></p>
<p>However, it is possible to see the list with the new values. However, I have problems with the graphs and these new values.</p>
<p>Can anybody help me?</p>

<p>Try using this and make sure to import the time module!</p>
<pre><code>timestamp = [time.strftime('%H:%M:%S',  time.gmtime(t/1000)) for t in timestamp1]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>In your code you're using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">datetime.strptime(date_string, format)</a> function, it's main use is to parse time strings in order to create datetime object.</p>
<p>In order to get a parsed string of a desired format you should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.strftime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">date.strftime(format)</a> function instead.
So basically in your code you can only add it and should get the wanted result:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
from datetime import datetime as dt

timestamp = [dt.strftime(dt.strptime(str(datetime.timedelta(seconds=round(t / 1000))), '%H:%M:%S'), '%H:%M:%S') for t in timestamp1]
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what was your input and desired output, but you could also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.fromtimestamp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">date.fromtimestamp(timestamp)</a> for the parsing of timestamps</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you add an example of the container  <code>timestamp1</code>? It's a unix timestamp, correct?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure, timestamp1= [502883,....]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I will try it and I will let you know !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. It works with few data but I cannot understand why graph is not working with lots of data. I would like to share the new graph. However, I don't know how to do it (I tried ctrl + g).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CarolinaF. Can't you edit your question ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edited my question. Can u check it please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CarolinaF. it looks like you have a problem with the xticks frequency (too dense) in your graphs, you should sparsify them. You didn't add the code you use for the graphs but assuming it's pyplot you can use the <a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.xticks.html#matplotlib-pyplot-xticks" rel="nofollow noreferrer">xticks()</a> or you can use <a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.locator_params" rel="nofollow noreferrer">locator_params(axis='both', tight=None, **kwargs)</a> But, you should add the code if you want a more specific answer</span>
