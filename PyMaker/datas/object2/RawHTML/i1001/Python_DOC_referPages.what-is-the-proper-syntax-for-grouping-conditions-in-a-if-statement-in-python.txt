<p>I'm having trouble fully understanding the syntax of if-statement in python. Is it possible to group up conditions as demonstrated below?</p>
<p><code>if my_age and neighborhood_age &gt; 20:
</code></p>
<p>Will python understand the above code <strong>exactly</strong> as:
<code>if my_age&gt; 20 and neighborhood_age &gt; 20:</code> ?</p>
<p>Provided it does understand exactly the same thing, how can I group conditions? e.g.:</p>
<p>Suppose I have three conditions:</p>
<p><code>my_age and neighborhood_age &gt; 20
father_age &lt; 60
cousin_age &lt; my age</code></p>
<p>What is the correct way to write the if-statement?
<code>if (my_age and neighborhood_age &gt; 20) and (father_age &lt; 60) and (cousin_age &lt; my age):</code> ?</p>
<p>And what happens if I start mixing 'and' and 'or' operators? What is the best way to write the following code:</p>
<p><code>if ((my_age and neighborhood_age &gt; 20) and (father_age &lt; 60) and (cousin_age &lt; my age)) or girlfriend_age &gt; 18:</code></p>

<p>No, it will not. Python will interpret it as this:</p>
<pre><code>if (my_age) and (neighborhood_age &gt; 20)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to compare two values against a third, you must do it like so:</p>
<pre><code>if (my_age &gt; 20 and neighborhood_age &gt; 20): ...
</code></pre>
<p>Or, with grouping for absolute clarity:</p>
<pre><code>if ((my_age &gt; 20) and (neighborhood_age &gt; 20)): ...
</code></pre>
<p>If you have many values to compare, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow noreferrer">all</a>:</p>
<pre><code>if all(age &gt; 20 for age in (my_age, neighborhood_age)): ...
</code></pre>
<p>As for your last example, I would probably write it like this, using multiple lines and parenthesis to remove ambiguity:</p>
<pre><code>if ((my_age &gt; 20 and neighborhood_age &gt; 20) and 
    (father_age &lt; 60) and 
    (cousin_age &lt; my age)
) or (girlfriend_age &gt; 18):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>In almost all but the simplest of cases, you should use parenthesis to make your intention absolutely clear.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to write each condition on it's own. The <code>and</code> keyword is the same thing that putting a <code>if</code> statement inside a <code>if</code> statement.
For example : </p>
<pre><code>if my_age &gt;= 20 and neighborhood_age &gt;= 20:
    # Do something
</code></pre>
<p>Is the same thing that</p>
<pre><code>if my_age &gt;= 20:
    if neighborhood_age &gt;= 20:
         # Do something
</code></pre>
<p>To mix <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> the cleaner way is to use well parentheses and end line.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">you have essentially all the syntax figured out, why don't you try running it and see what happens? (and to address the first portion, don't write conditions like <code>if my_age and neighborhood_age &gt; 20</code>, your 2nd code would be the way to write it. <code>if my_age&gt; 20 and neighborhood_age &gt; 20</code> Other than that however, its all spot on. just try it out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The second example works well if I have a few variables to match a condition, but what should I do if I want to compare dozens of variables to a value?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">python provides quite a few tools to deal with multiple conditions. take a look at <code>any</code>, <code>all</code> and membership tests <code>in</code> that can make setting up the more complex conditions trivial. All require setting up some kind of list first, and then the check becomes easy.</span>
