<p>I'm trying to create a Text object with multiple strings using the Zelle Graphics library, but it seems to accept only a single string argument. This is how I set it up:</p>
<pre><code>text = Text(Point(250, 250), "You have", x, "remaining")
</code></pre>
<p>This is the desired output (as displayed in the graphics window):</p>
<p>"You have x remaining"</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You neglected to explain that you are using the <code>graphics</code> module by John Zelle. I know that is in the tag, but it is better to be a little bit more explicit. Even experts cannot be expected to know automatically about every library out there.</p>
<p>The <code>Text</code> class in that module has a constructor with the following signature:</p>
<pre><code>def __init__(self, p, text): 
</code></pre>
<p>meaning you have to pass it a <code>Point</code> object and exactly one string. That means you can't do this:</p>
<pre><code>text = Text(Point(250, 250), "You have", x, "remaining")
</code></pre>
<p>but you can do </p>
<pre><code>text = Text(Point(250, 250), f"You have {x} remaining")
</code></pre>
<p>in Python 3.7 or </p>
<pre><code>text = Text(Point(250, 250), "You have {x} remaining".format(x=x))
</code></pre>
<p>in earlier versions.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From what I understand from your question you would like something like this:</p>
<pre><code>x = 4
print("You have %s of these remaining" % x)

# Output: You have 4 of these remaining
</code></pre>
<p>You can think of %s as a place holder, and you asign its value after the % outside of the string.</p>
<p>Another way of doing it would be like this:</p>
<pre><code>x = 4
print("You have " + str(x) + " of these remaining")
</code></pre>
<p>This would print the same thing.</p>

<p>String formatting is what you are referring to.
.format should be good <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Documentation</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you please add an example and desired output? It's not that very clear with just the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you had a look at string formatting?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since you've not provided any pseudo code, desired output or example, I am assuming this is all about formatting as the other user mentions in the comment above. Well I'll suggest just go through basic formatting a string in python.   <a href="https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">realpython.com/python-f-strings</a></span>
