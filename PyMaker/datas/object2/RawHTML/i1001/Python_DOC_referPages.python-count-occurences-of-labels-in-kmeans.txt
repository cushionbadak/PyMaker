<p>Im trying to compare a list of labels from Sklears Kmeans, with the predicted labels for another dataset. But the label list are different sizes, so i want the occurrence of each label.</p>
<p>So I have already tried using Counter, but im not getting exactly what i want. At the moment im using np.unique and there are still some problems.</p>
<p>As an Example:</p>
<pre><code>X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0],[4, 2], [4, 4], [4, 0]])

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=0).fit(X)

Unique,count = np.unique(kmeans.labels_,return_index=True)

print(count) # [2 2 1 1] so far so good

New_Labels = kmeans.predict([[0, 4], [4, 4],[0,5],[1,6],[7,2],[4,0],[4,2]])

print(New_Labels) # [3 0 3 3 0 2 0] also good

Unique1,count1 = np.unique(Labels,return_index=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Then here is where i have the problem.</p>
<pre><code>print(Unique1,count1) #[3 1 3]
</code></pre>
<p>I would like the output of my count of the labels to also say 0 if the label of a cluster is not there. 
So I would like the count of my predicted labels to be</p>
<pre><code>[3 0 1 3]
</code></pre>
<p>Could anyone help with this?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the following list comprehension, which goes through all possible cluster assignments and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.count</code></a> the occurrences of each element:</p>
<pre><code>[l.count(i) for i in range(max(l)+1)]
[3, 0, 1, 3]
</code></pre>
