printable(tableData)
</code></pre>
<p>For example if i have a data like </p>
<pre><code>bob,sob,cob,dab 
</code></pre>
<p>if i print it using loop then it will be printed one by one what i want is
after printing bob and sob i want the cursor come back upwards and then print cob dab</p>
<pre><code>first:print  
      bob  
      sob  
second:then cursor comes back up and print  
      cob  
      dab              
the output i wanted is  
bob cob  
sob dab  
</code></pre>
<p>if i remove dab in the above data then the output should be<br/>
bob cob<br/>
sob<br/>
Is this possible in Python?
can anyone provide an example</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do</p>
<pre><code>data = [['apples', 'oranges', 'cherries', 'banana'],
        ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'David'],
        ['dogs', 'cats', 'moose', 'goose']]

for row in zip(*data):
    print(' '.join(row))
</code></pre>
<p>output</p>
<pre><code>apples Alice dogs
oranges Bob cats
cherries Carol moose
banana David goose
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT - expand the answer in case of unequal length:
Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.zip_longest()</code></a></p>
<pre><code>from itertools import zip_longest
data = [['apples', 'oranges', 'cherries', 'banana'],
['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'David'],
['dogs', 'cats', 'moose']]

for row in zip_longest(*data, fillvalue=''):
    print(' '.join(row))
</code></pre>
<p>output</p>
<pre><code>apples Alice dogs
oranges Bob cats
cherries Carol moose
banana David
</code></pre>
<p>The default fillvalue is <code>None</code> - you can keep it if you prefer</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Expanding on one of the answers and using your simple list (bob, sob, cob, dab), you can use a modulo based on index position in the single-dimension list, then append '\n' to create a new line with proper spacing:</p>
<pre><code>data = ['bob','sob','cob','dab']
print(' '.join(['\n{}'.format(i) if data.index(i) % 2 == 0 else i for i in data]))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>bob sob 
cob dab
</code></pre>

<pre><code>data = ["Mom", "Dad", "Son", "Daughter"]

for person in data:
    print(person, end='\n')
</code></pre>
<p>If what I think you're trying to do is just get a statement to print on a new line, the <code>end=</code> parameter must be added into the print statement. It's not required, but it is useful.</p>
<p>If you want to print multiple names on the same line, you can use the separator parameter <code>sep=","</code> to add a comma after each name. The <code>end</code> parameter goes after it to ensure skipping to the next line.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">can you provide the expected output for some input ? your question does not match what you described and your code has animals, names and fruit not some 'dab sob cab' - it is confusing, but in general you cant return to a line after printing it - create a list of lines and print it after you have built it already</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What operating system are you using? If on Unix you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b><code>curses</code></b></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you really want to do it this way you can uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">curses</a>, but you should probably just restructure to print things in the correct order the first time</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b><code>zip</code></b></a> sequences to iterate over them in consort.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DerteTrdelnik the 'dab sab cab' is example i have taken if i have input like a,b,c,d when we print it using loop it prints one by one all i want is after printing a and b then c and d should print in the new line as i have shown in the above output</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if i remove 'goose' then the last column is not printing how do i get output even if i remove one or two elements in list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CvNikhil, Check my updated answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks a lot can u explain above for loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is not clear in the loop? Just check (e.g print) what zip/zip_longest return.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can u explain above print statement</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CvNikhil Without the print statement, the output would end up having the '\n' in it (<code>'\nbob sob \ncob dab'</code>). Printing those puts data on new lines so that output is formatted per your request.  Dies that answer your question or are you referring to something else?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i don't want everything to be printed downwards after printing mom and dad the son and daughter should be printed side of mom and dad as i have shown in question for the data</span>
