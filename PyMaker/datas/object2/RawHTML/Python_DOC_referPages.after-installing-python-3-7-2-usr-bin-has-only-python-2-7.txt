<p>I am new to python and I have just installed <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python 3.7.2</a>, at least that is what my IDLE tells me. However, when I check my usr/bin, I see python2.7 only. Why is that? What's going on?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>P.S.: this is first and only python that my machine had seen, I am pretty sure.</p>
<p>System: IOS v.10.13.6</p>

<p>Now a days, <strong>MAC OS X</strong> comes with <code>python2</code> pre-installed and they make it available for use by placing it in in <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and this location is already in the <strong>System PATH</strong>.</p>
<p>If you install any new version like <strong>Python3+</strong> it installs on <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/&lt;version&gt;/bin/</code>. </p>
<p>E.g. In my case, the fullpath is <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3</code> &amp; <code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/python3.6</code>. </p>
<p>I have installed <strong>Python3.6</strong> using <strong>Homebrew</strong>.</p>
<p>Below are the helpful logs of my terminal. Please have a look.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Run <code>which python3.7</code>. It should tell you where your new Python is. Probably <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, or somewhere in your home directory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It almost certaily installed it somewhere else, but our guesses will depend enormously on what platform you're on and how you installed it. For a start, can we assume you actually mean <code>/usr/bin</code> with a slash in front?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This question is not for StackOverflow but a different Stack Exchange site. What happens when you type <code>python</code> on the command line and press Tab? You should see the list of available Python versions, then use the <code>which</code> command.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112 Thanks! Ok, it is in a different location. But the fact that I have python2.7 not 3.7 in usr/bin is problem. For instance if I supply Xcode with a building tool, I usually refer to usr/bin/"tool", but python2.7 that I have there is the wrong tool...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tripleee You are absolutely right. It somehow has python 2.7 from 2017. I have to repost the question now, I guess...</span>
