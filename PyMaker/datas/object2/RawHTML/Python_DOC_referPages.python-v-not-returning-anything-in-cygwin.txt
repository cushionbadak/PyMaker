<p>I am trying to run <code>python3.6.8</code> in <code>cygwin</code>.</p>
<p>Typing <code>python -v</code> just results in the terminal window hanging. I have to escape out of it to make it respond further.</p>
<p>Typing <code>python36 -v</code> results in the error <code>python36 command not found</code>. I definitely installed this module while installing <code>Cygwin</code>.</p>
<p>I notice in /cygdrive/c, only python27 seems to be present. Running python -i also shows me that 2.7 is installed.</p>
<p>I want to run 3.6.8, have tried reinstalling multiple times, same issue.</p>
<p>Running "which python" shows only</p>
<pre><code>/cygdrive/c/Python27/python
</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone help me troubleshoot this please?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Generally all the python versions with 3 can be accessed using python3 as binary. In windows often the path variable doesn't hold the python3 binary path so the binary is not called.</p>
<p>do </p>
<pre><code>echo $PATH | grep python
</code></pre>
<p>Check for the version of the python if python36 is present then do </p>
<pre><code>python3 --version
</code></pre>

<p>Look in <code>/usr/bin</code> for all python exe's. Use <code>ls -l /usr/bin/python*.*</code>. I suspect you will not find <code>python3.6m.exe</code>.</p>
<p>Run cygwin setup again and select the <code>python3.6</code> package. You can also install a version of 3.7, 3.8 or some older ones if you wish. You can only get the latest release of the e.g. 3.6 series.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should use <code>python -V</code> to see the version info. Try also <code>python3 -V</code>. However ... It looks like you do not have the cygwin python 2.7 installed, because <code>/cygdrive/c/Python27/python</code> is the windows version of python. You need to run cygwin setup again to install the python package you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm, the first command has no results. The second says "python3 : command not found". Very odd behaviour. Thanks for your response.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SimonKiely the issue is with the path variable and not the installation. In cygwin this happens. May I suggest you to use Mobaxterm community edition -- this is far better than cygwin and you won't face such issues. Install mobaxterm and then install using apt. Mobaxterm supports apt.</span>
