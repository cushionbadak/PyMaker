<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've tried searching and trying suggestions people made for others but its not working for me, here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>def CreateAccount():
    FirstName = input('What is your first name?: ')
    SecondName = input('What is your second name?: ')
    Age = input('How old are you?: ')
    AreaLive = input("What area do you live in?: ")
    return FirstName, SecondName, Age, AreaLive

def DisplayAccountInfo(FirstName,SecondName,Age,AreaLive):
    print("Your Firstname is",FirstName)
    print("Your Secondname is",SecondName)
    print("You are",Age," years old")
    print("You live in the",AreaLive," area")
    return




def ConfirmAccountF():
    ConfirmAccount = input("Do you have an account? y,n; ")
    if  ConfirmAccount == "n":
        CreateAccount()

    else: #ConfirmAccount -- 'y'
        DisplayAccountInfo()

while True:

    ConfirmAccountF()
</code></pre>
<p>So its just supposed to run indefinitely for now, but what I want it to do is pass the variables from 'CreateAccount' into 'DisplayAccountInfo'.</p>
<p>When I press anything other than <em>n</em> for 'ConfirmAccount' I get that the variables are undefined.</p>
<p>If I set it manually in 'DisplayAccountInfo()' then it doesn't throw any errors.</p>
<p>This is just me messing about and trying to understand python, if anyone can help that would be great.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">unpacking operator, *</a>:</p>
<p><code>DisplayAccountInfo(*CreateAccount())</code></p>
<p>What this does is takes the tuple of four strings returned by <code>CreateAccount</code> and converts them into four arguments to be passed as separate parameters to <code>DisplayAccountInfo</code>. Whereas if you omitted the <code>*</code> operator and just called <code>DisplayAccountInfo(CreateAccount())</code>, that would pass a single tuple argument to <code>DisplayAccountInfo</code>, resulting in a <code>TypeError</code> exception (because <code>DisplayAccountInfo</code> expects four arguments, not one).</p>
<p>Of course if you also need to save the strings returned from <code>CreateAccount</code> for later use, you'll need to do that in between calling <code>CreateAccount</code> and <code>DisplayAccountInfo</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The variable you declared on <code>CreateAccount()</code> can't be accesed by its name from the outside. To pass the information to another function you need to store its values first:</p>
<pre><code>first_name, second_name, age, area = "", "", "", ""

def ConfirmAccountF():
    ConfirmAccount = input("Do you have an account? y,n; ")
    if  ConfirmAccount == "n":
        first_name, second_name, age, area = CreateAccount()

    else: #ConfirmAccount -- 'y'
        DisplayAccountInfo(first_name, second_name, age, area)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">the <code>createAccount</code> is returning the variables but you are not assigning them to anything. Do something like <code>data = CreateAccount()</code> instead and then pass the <code>*data</code> in the <code>DisplayAccountInfo()</code> function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What account-information do you want to show in <code>DisplayAccountInfo()</code>? If the user types <code>y</code>, how do you know which account to display info for?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, my code is not the best, but I think is the easy to understand without further knowledge of python</span>
