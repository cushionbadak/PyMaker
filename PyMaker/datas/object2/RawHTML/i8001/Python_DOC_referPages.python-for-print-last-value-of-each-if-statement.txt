<p>I'm doing a for loop in python, but I don't know how to print the last value accumulated within each branch of the <code>if</code> statement... i.e. (not for each iteration of the loop):</p>
<pre><code>a = 0
for i in range(0,10):
    if i&lt;2:
        a+= i
    elif i&gt;7:
        a+= i
print a
</code></pre>
<p>The first branch increments <code>a</code> to 0 and 1, so I want to print "1". The second branch has also increments <code>a</code> twice, to 9 and 18, so I want to print "18".</p>
<p>Current Output</p>
<pre><code>18
</code></pre>
<p>Expected output</p>
<pre><code>1
18
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for i in range(0,10):
    if (i &lt; 1) or (i &gt; 8):
        print i

<pre><code>0

<p>As said by @gilgameshbk just indent the <code>print a</code> statement. Python unlike other languages like c or Java is sensitive to indentation. Your code should look like this -</p>
<pre><code>a=0
for i in range(0,10):
    if i&lt;1 or i&gt;8 :
        a+=i
        print a
</code></pre>
<p>The problem was that your <code>print</code> statement was out of the <code>if</code> blocks.Note that you should have used <code>or</code> to make the code more compact.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Now that you have clarified your intent somewhat, it looks like you are trying to increment for every element in certain ranges, then print the last element for that range.</p>
<p>For the trivial example that you show, do</p>
<pre><code>a = 0
for i in range(10):
    if i &lt; 2:
        a += i
        if i == 1:
            print(a)
    elif i &gt; 7:
        a += i
        if i == 9:
            print(a)
</code></pre>
<p>In a more general sense, it you can use the fact that you really have multiple ranges here and that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">range objects are indexable</a>.</p>
<p>In your example, you have two ranges:</p>
<pre><code>ranges = [range(2), range(7, 10)]
</code></pre>
<p>You can loop over them, do the incrementing and print on the last element of each range:</p>
<pre><code>a = 0
for rng in ranges:
    for i in rng:
        a += i
        if i == rng[-1]:
            print(a)
</code></pre>
<p>In fact, you don't really need the inner loop at all since <code>range</code> objects can be passed directly to <code>sum</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for rng in ranges:
    a += sum(rng)
    print(a)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>if you want to print the total sum only, I suggest you use <code>list</code> comprehensions like this:</p>
<pre><code>result = [sum(x for x in range(0,10) if x &lt; 2), sum(y for y in range(0,10) if y &gt;7 or y &lt; 2)]
for i in result:
    print i
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>1
18
</code></pre>
<p>if you want to use <code>if-</code>statements instead, you can use a <code>boolean</code> to check if the low value is printed or not like:</p>
<pre><code>a = 0
printed = False
for i in range(0,10):
    if i&lt;2:
        a+= i
    elif i&gt;7:
        if not printed:
            print a
            printed = True
        a+= i
print a
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>1
18
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use two print statements, like this:</p>
<pre><code>a = 0
for i in range(0,10):
  if i&lt;1:
    a+= i
    print(a)
  elif i&gt;8:
    a+= i
    print(a)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure about that edit OP? Your question makes no sense at all now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please re-read your whole question and fix it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please fix your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you are right, the example is so simple that it has infinite answers, I will post the real command, thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I hope you like my edits. I think I made it pretty unambiguous without needing a more complicated example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You really don't need those parens around the condition in the <code>if</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MadPhysicist yes. It was a mistake. I had started my computer learning from c. So I tend to think in C. Thanks a lot</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The question has been clarified significantly. This is not what OP is looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MadPhysicist this is because the question was edited more than 3 times with 3 different expected results</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The result you showed originally was not a valid option for any of them. Thanks for the fix.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, <code>a=result[-1]</code> probably</span>
