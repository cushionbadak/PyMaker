<p>I would like to use "utf-8" string constant because it is always confusing for me to choose between "UTF-8", "UTF8", "utf8", "utf-8", "utf-8", "utf_8"</p>
<p>All code samples in python documentation have syntax like:</p>
<pre><code>with io.open("/tmp/a.txt", "w", encode="utf-8") as file_cursor:
    file_cursor.write(text)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Can somebody tell me why is like this, maybe some best practice, zends ... ?</strong></p>
<p>I would like to use code suggestion in IDE to achieve something like:</p>
<pre><code>with io.open("/tmp/a.txt", "w", encode=ENCODINGS.UTF8) as file_cursor:
    file_cursor.write(text)  
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Is there any standard constant out of the box in python core?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use:</p>
<pre><code>import encodings

encodings.utf_8.getregentry().name
</code></pre>
<p>which gives <code>'utf-8'</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Why does it matter? python accepts all of the above, you could even use <code>Utf - 8</code> or <code>- -uTf _#8_ - -</code> if you want. If you were to define constants for encodings, you'd probably end up with the names of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">standard encodings</a> and their value equal to their names, which (at least to me) seems pointless and unpythonic, now you need to import those constants from somewhere before you can use them, and it doesn't add any value.</span>
