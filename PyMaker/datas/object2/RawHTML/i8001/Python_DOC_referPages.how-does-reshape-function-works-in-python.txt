<p>Can anyone explain what this line is doing in python code ?</p>
<p><code>X.reshape((X.shape[0], 1) + X.shape[1:])</code></p>
<p>I am using numpy here.</p>

<p>Basically, this code is changing the shape of <code>X</code> to have an additional (size 1, or <code>singleton</code> if you are used to <code>MATLAB</code>) dimension.  So if the shape was previously <code>(3,3,3)</code> it changes it to <code>(3,1,3,3)</code>. This doesn't add any data since <code>3x3x3=3x1x3x3=27</code> It would probably be used so that the number of dimensions match (for functions that include another array).  An equivalent form would be:</p>
<pre><code>X = X[:, None, ...]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why not try it out in the interactive interpreter?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">With that downvote, I will remember it for next time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not the one that downvoted, but it's still a valid question. One of the great things about Python is that we can test things interactively.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would rather call it <code>singleton</code> dim, borrowed from MATLAB.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Empty would be something like <code>np.random.rand(3,0,2)</code>, etc., i.e. a dim of length <code>0</code> AFAI understand dims. Also, that <code>singleton</code> term used by one more author here - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3551859/3293881">stackoverflow.com/a/3551859/3293881</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Seems like the <code>numpy</code> docs mostly call it a "size 1 dimension"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There should be no spaces between the dots of the ellipsis (<code>...</code>) otherwise you may get a syntax error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kazemakase That's true <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#changed-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">only as of Python 3</a>.</span>
