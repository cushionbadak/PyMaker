<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to create a very simple program but I ran into a problem with my <code>if/then</code> statement. A very simplified version of the code I was using is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>print "What's your name?"
name = raw_input()
if name == 'Bob':
    print "Hi Bob."
if name == 'Mary':
    print "Hi Mary."
else:
    print "I don't know your name."
</code></pre>
<p>If I enter 'Bob' it prints "Hi Bob." followed by the else statement (which is the problem), but if I enter 'Mary' it doesn't print the else statement. I tried adding the <code>else</code> statement after each <code>if</code> statement, but that didn't work either. What am I doing wrong? How can I use more than one <code>if</code> statement if there is only one <code>else</code> statement?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>elif</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function

print("What's your name?")
name = raw_input()
if name == 'Bob':
    print("Hi Bob.")
elif name == 'Mary':
    print("Hi Mary.")
else:
    print("I don't know your name.")
</code></pre>
