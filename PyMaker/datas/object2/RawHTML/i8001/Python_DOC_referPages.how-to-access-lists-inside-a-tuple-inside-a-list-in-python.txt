<p>I am a newbie to python. Trying to learn how to access Lists inside a Tuple inside a List. My List is:</p>
<pre><code>holidays = [(0,),
 (1, [2, 16]),
 (2, [20]),
 (4, [14]),
 (5, [29]),
 (7, [4]),
 (9, [4]),
 (11, [23, 24]),
 (12, [25])]
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to know the best way to access each tuple and its list in a more efficient way. I tried using:</p>
<pre><code>for i, tuples in enumerate(holidays):
    for list in tuples:
        print list
</code></pre>
<p>But i get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>for list in tuples:
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
</code></pre>
<p>Help would be much appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to remove the i in the first for loop:</p>
<pre><code>for tuples in enumerate(holidays):
    for list in tuples:
        print list
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>short version  </p>
<p><code>[y for x in holidays if isinstance(x, tuple) for y in x if isinstance(y, list)]</code></p>
<p>You can't do a for .. in  LOOP on an integer, that's why the program cras</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Well, your <em>holidays</em>  list is not uniform: the first entry is an integer (0), the others are tuples.</p>
<pre><code>holidays = [0,  # &lt;- integer
    (1, [2, 16]),
    (2, [20]),
    (4, [14]),
    (5, [29]),
    (7, [4]),
    (9, [4]),
    (11, [23, 24]),
    (12, [25])]
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a possible loop:</p>
<pre><code>for entry in holidays:
    if entry == 0:
        continue  # don't know what to do with zero
    month, days = entry
    print(month, days)
</code></pre>
<p>We use unpaking to extract the <em>month</em> and the <em>days</em>.

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Change your first element 0 to (0), Also, remove 'i' from your for loop, as told by Stavros, it will work.</p>
<pre><code>holidays = [([0]),
 (1, [2, 16]),
 (2, [20]),
 (4, [14]),
 (5, [29]),
 (7, [4]),
 (9, [4]),
 (11, [23, 24]),
 (12, [25])]
</code></pre>
<p>tuples in enumerate(holidays):
    list in tuples:
        print list</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your first element is <code>0</code> not a tuple, an <code>int</code> and not iterable</span>
<span class="comment-copy">first element is a tuple. it got editted by someone</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ahh.. thank you! now trying to get to each tuple and list specifically. Would you be able to put your insight on it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do  you mean exactly provide an example</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. Will appreciate if you can explain what really is happening in this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I use list comprehension to make a list. You can try [x*x for x in range(10)] to have all x squares from 0 to 9. Then on the first loop i take all elements that are instances of a tuple in holidays : <code>for x in holidays if isinstance(x, tuple)</code> Then for each x element found, i get the elements that are instances of a list. :  <code>for y in x if isinstance(y, list)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have made initial 0 as a (0,) tuple as well. Ran your suggested code and it gives the following error:     month, days = entry ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have seenmy answer ,and you propose the same thing just hit the +1 arrow, don't post duplicate answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Had to mention the change in the dataset. Also, I can't vote yet, otherwise I would have.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Basicly you can vote but it's is not seed until you have a reputation</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the info.</span>
