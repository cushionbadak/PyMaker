<p>I am currently writing some python code that asks for a users name. I need the program to validate whether the user's input is a string or not. If it is a string, The loop will break and the programme will continue. If the input is not a string (like a float, integer etc), It will loop around and ask the user to input a valid string. I understand that you can use the following code when you are checking for an integer;</p>
<pre><code>while True:
try:
    number = int(input("Plese enter a number: "))
    break
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid integer")
</code></pre>
<p>I was thinking that I could use something like this to check for a string;</p>
<pre><code>while True:
try:
    word = str(input("Plese enter a string: "))
    break
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid string")
</code></pre>
<p>But as far as I understand, the <strong>str()</strong> just converts the user's input to a string, regardless of the data that was entered.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Based on the comments, it looks like you want to check if the input consists of alphabetic characters only. You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.isalpha()</code></a> method:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    word = input("Please enter a string: ")
    if word.isalpha():
        # Do something with valid input.
        break
    else:
        print("Please enter a valid string")    
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't quite get what you are trying to do. What's a valid string to you?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">So, I want the programme to check whether the user has typed in a string. If so, it will break the loop as shown in the code. If the user has entered another type of data (integer, float etc), It will tell them to try again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's <i>always</i> a string. Even if they type <code>487</code>, you'll get a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean you want to know if the user entered only alphabetic characters (no numeric or special characters)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes! This worked! Thanks for the help (:</span>
