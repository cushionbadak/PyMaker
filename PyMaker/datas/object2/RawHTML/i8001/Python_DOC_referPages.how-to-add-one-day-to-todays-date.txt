<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I wrote this line of code:</p>
<pre><code>date = time.strftime("%d/%m/%Y")
</code></pre>
<p>How can I add one day to today's date?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd suggest using <code>datetime</code>. Then you could do</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, timedelta

tomorrow = datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)
tomorrow_formatted = tomorrow.strftime('%d/%m/%Y')

print(tomorrow_formatted)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>datetime</code> and <code>timedelta</code> are not the only 'right' libraries.</p>
<p><strong><code>arrow</code></strong> is nice too!</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import arrow
&gt;&gt;&gt; arrow.now().replace(days=+1).format('DD/MM/YY')
'22/05/17'
</code></pre>
<p>Other attractive features to recommend it as well.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Start by not formatting the time to a string. Do you need to have tomorrow's date as a string? What is this going to be used for?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters I'm actually going to strip this string to days, months and years.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That doesn't mean much. You mean you need to have the day, month and year values as integers?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters Yes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then you are using the wrong library, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime</code> library</a> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">except arrow is not in the standard lib. KISS: refrain from adding extra libs unless necessary (in this case, it's quite easy to do with existing <code>datetime</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cowbert: There's no <i>necessity</i> of using arrow, I agree. But dates and times are not generally easy. It's worth being aware of other possibilities.</span>
