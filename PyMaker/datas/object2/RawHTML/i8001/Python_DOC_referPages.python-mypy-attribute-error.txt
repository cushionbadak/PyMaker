<p>I have a python3.4 project and I recently decided to use mypy for better understanding.</p>
<p>This chunk of code works but checking with mypy pops out an error :</p>
<pre><code>import zipfile

def zip_to_txt(zip: typing.IO[bytes]) -&gt; BytesIO:
zz = zipfile.ZipFile(zip)
output = BytesIO()
for line, info in enumerate(zz.filelist):
    date = "%d-%02d-%02d %02d:%02d:%02d" % info.date_time[:6]
    output.write(str.encode("%-46s %s %12d\n" % (info.filename, date, info.file_size)))
output.seek(0, 0)
return output
</code></pre>
<p>The error : </p>
<p><code>PyPreviewGenerator/file_converter.py:170: error: "ZipFile" has no attribute "filelist"</code>  (corresponds to this line : <code>for line, info in enumerate(zz.filelist):</code>)</p>
<p>But when I look inside the ZipFile class, I can clearly see that the attribute exists.Â <br/>
So why does the error occurs ? and is there a way I can resolve it ?</p>

<p>In short, the reason is because the <code>filelist</code> attribute is not documented within Typeshed, the collection of type stubs for the stdlib/various 3rd party libraries. You can see this for yourself <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/stdlib/2and3/zipfile.pyi" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Why is <code>filelist</code> not included? Well, because it doesn't actually appear to be a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documented part of the API</a>. If you search through the document, you'll see <code>filelist</code> is not mentioned anywhere.</p>
<p>Instead, you should call the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.infolist" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>infolist()</code> method</a>, which returns exactly what you want (see <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/zipfile.py#L1249" rel="nofollow noreferrer">implementation here</a> if you're curious). You'll notice <code>infolist()</code> <em>is</em> indeed <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/stdlib/2and3/zipfile.pyi#L31" rel="nofollow noreferrer">listed within typeshed</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I did not know that it needs to be used as it is documented to work with mypy.</span>
