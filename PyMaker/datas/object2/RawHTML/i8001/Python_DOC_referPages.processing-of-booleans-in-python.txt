<p>I have a question about a logical expression of the following sort:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range (k): #k is large
    if (a==b and test(c)==b): #test() takes some time to calculate
         do something
</code></pre>
<p>Now I want to know, how the logical expression is processed. Are the two simple expressions calculated first and then combined via <code>and</code>? Or is <code>a==b</code> calculated, and in case it is <code>False</code>, <code>test(c)==b</code> neglected?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The <code>a==b</code> will be calculated first, and if it's true then the second expression will be evaluated. This is known as 'short-circuiting', see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, <code>and</code> short-circuits and the second expression is not evaluated if the first produced false.</span>
