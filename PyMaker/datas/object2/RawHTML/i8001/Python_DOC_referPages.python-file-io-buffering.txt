<p>I need to iterate over the lines of a couple of text files a couple of times.
This is currently done with multiple</p>
<pre><code>with open("file.txt") as f: 
    for line in f:
        # do something
</code></pre>
<p>Although performance is not an issue yet, I'd like to read the files only once into an <code>io.StringIO</code> buffer and then work with that.</p>

<p>This is a working snippet</p>
<pre><code>import io
sio = io.StringIO( open("file.txt").read() )
for line in sio:
    print(line)
sio.seek(0)
for line in sio:
    print(line)
sio.close()
</code></pre>
<p>or wrapping it in a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with" rel="nofollow noreferrer">with</a> statement <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">context manager</a></p>
<pre><code>import io
with io.StringIO( open("file.txt").read() ) as sio:
    for line in sio:
        print(line)
    sio.seek(0)
    for line in sio:
        print(line)
    #sio.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Questions</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this a "good" way of doing it, what are alternatives?</li>
<li>What happens to the file object used to read the file (there's no way to explicitly <code>close()</code> it this way)?</li>
<li>Where can I read more about Python's io buffering (I think I read something about Python optimizing multiple file accesses by buffering automatically)?</li>
</ol>

<p>What you're doing is already the right way. Quoting from this answer: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8009882/how-to-read-large-file-line-by-line-in-python">How to read large file, line by line in python</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>with</code> statement handles opening and closing the file, including if an exception is raised in the inner block. The <code>for line in f</code> treats the file object <code>f</code> as an iterable, which automatically uses buffered IO and memory management so you don't have to worry about large files.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, but my questions are about processing a file <i>multiple</i> times. Should it be <code>open()</code>ed multiple times? Also there are no references about the buffering.</span>
