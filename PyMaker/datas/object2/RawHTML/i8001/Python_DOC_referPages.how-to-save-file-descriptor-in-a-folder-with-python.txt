<span class="comment-copy">It's not clear question for me. Looks like you can just... copy that file. <code>from shutil import copyfile</code> and then <code>copyfile(src, dst)</code>. More about it in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org – shutil</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">indeed, I'm not writing anythting to it, I do have the file descriptor, how can I do that ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Iv tried copyfile, it requires paths, I do not have 'src', just the file fd, it didn't work!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then maybe you should try <code>os.sendfile</code>? <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.sendfile" rel="nofollow noreferrer">manual–os.sendfile</a> I think it could help. By the way – I need to do my own staff now, so I hope it'll help (or somebody else would). I'll check that question in the evening (what mean few hours). Good luck! ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I shouldn't try to help when I'm on the go... I'm sorry if I'm not clear or don't understand problem. So – don't take my "solutions" too seriously, please. I can be wrong...</span>
