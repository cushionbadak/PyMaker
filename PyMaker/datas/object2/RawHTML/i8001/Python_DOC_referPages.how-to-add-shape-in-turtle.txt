<p>I am trying to re-create the legend of zelda 1986 version in python and I immediately ran into a problem. I cant add the link gif to be the shape. Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>from turtle import*
screen=Screen()
link=Turtle()
walk="grid-cell-18443-1434401894-3.gif"
sword="legend-of-zelda-86.gif"
screen.addshape(walk)
screen.addshape(sword)
link.shape("walk")
</code></pre>
<p>I got an error. in short,</p>
<pre><code>"_tkinter.TclError: couldn't open "grid-cell-18443-1434401894-3.gif": 
no such file or directory"
</code></pre>
<p>It is a real file in the downloads folder! Please help!</p>
<p>And thank you in advance.</p>

<p>It looks like your source code is running from a different location to where your images are stored.</p>
<p>If you move your images to your source code directory, you should not get the <code>no such file or directory</code> error.</p>
<p>You can check the current directory of your interpreter using functions from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os</a> module.</p>
<pre><code>import os
print(os.getcwd())
</code></pre>
<p>You can also change to the appropriate directory if you don't want to move the files.</p>
<pre><code>os.chdir("/path/to/files")
</code></pre>

<p>the problem is where you did <code>walk="grid-cell-18443-1434401894-3.gif"</code> and then later using the string <code>walk</code> for turtle/tkinter. what you should do is either move  file "grid-cell-18443-1434401894-3.gif" to your python file, or do this code:</p>
<pre><code>from turtle import*
screen=Screen()
link=Turtle()
walk="This PC/Downloads/grid-cell-18443-1434401894-3.gif"
sword="legend-of-zelda-86.gif"
screen.addshape(walk)
screen.addshape(sword)
link.shape("walk")
</code></pre>
