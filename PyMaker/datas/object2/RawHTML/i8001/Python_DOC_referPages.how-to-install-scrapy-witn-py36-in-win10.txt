<p>Recently we want to rewrite our project with python3(now it was py2.7).We mainly use scrapy to grab data from website,but I can't install scrapy in py36 now.</p>
<pre><code>  Running setup.py install for Twisted ... error
Exception:

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/trunk/INSTALL.rst" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Installation Requirements</a> of Twisted on GitHub,
it looks like it is not yet compatible with Python 3.6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To install Twisted, you need:</p>
<p>Python 2.7 (full functionality) or 3.3/3.4/3.5 (subset of functionality).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, in the Python 3.6 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">changelog</a>, you can see that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PEP 528 and PEP 529, Windows filesystem and console encoding changed to UTF-8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This affects the value returned by <code>sys.__stdout__.encoding</code>, which causes the <code>UnicodeDecodeError</code> you see in the stack trace.</p>
<p>So I would suggest you to keep using Python 3.5 until Twisted updates to support Python 3.6. If you really cannot, as a last resort try setting up your project in a non-Windows environment (e.g. a virtual machine), or hack around this issue by setting the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONIOENCODING" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PYTHONIOENCODING</a> environment variable to whatever <code>sys.__stdout__.encoding</code> used to return before the upgrade to 3.6. But it has downsides, it may not work, and there might be other incompatibilities down the road anyway.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">On Windows, Scrapy docs <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html#windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">recommend using Anaconda/Miniconda</a> with <code>conda-forge</code> channel.</span>
