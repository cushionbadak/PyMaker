<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For example </p>
<pre><code>d= {1: [1,4,0], 3: [3,6,0], 2:[2,5,8]}
print d
</code></pre>
<p>I want the out put to give me </p>
<pre><code>1 3 2
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried this <code>d[0]</code>
but it prints the value </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just print the keys using <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/dictionary_keys.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>d.keys()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d= {1: [1,4,0], 3: [3,6,0], 2:[2,5,8]}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.keys()
[1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.keys()[0]
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Interestingly enough, <code>d[0]</code> should not actually return a value, it should raise a <code>KeyError</code> because it looks for the value that matches the key of <code>0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d= {1: [1,4,0], 3: [3,6,0], 2:[2,5,8]}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d[0]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
KeyError: 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could also loop through the key value pairs.  However, if you wanted all the keys printed on one line you would need to modify this a little.</p>
<pre><code> d= {1: [1,4,0], 3: [3,6,0], 2:[2,5,8]}

 for k, v in d.items():
     print(k)

 output:
 1
 3
 2

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to StackOverflow.  Please read and follow the posting guidelines in the help documentation.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic">on topic</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">how to ask</a> apply here. StackOverflow is not a design, coding, research, or tutorial service. There are plenty of on-line tutorials and documentation to show you how to access dictionary facilities.  How did <i>none</i> of these satisfy what you're missing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to mention the fact that dicts are unordered. You cannot be sure the result will always be <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, in that order.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If the dictionary is exactly as entered above it will always be <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> because the hashes are not random. However, if the values change then yes the keys may change.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It will always be <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> on your system, with your specific version of Python. It might be different for the OP. And it isn't <code>[1, 3, 2]</code>, as expected by the OP. OP might want to use another data type if the order is important.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EricDuminil <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping</a> states that it is hashing, which is not different per system.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe I wasn't clear. My point is just that dicts are unordered, and that you should mention it in your answer.</span>
