<p>I am using the openpyxl library to write data into an excel file, I want this file to be automatically opened (to pop up) for user when its finished writing data, I've looked so much but found nothing more than saving the file, which I have already done.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think one possibility to do this would be with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.startfile" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.startfile</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.startfile('your_excel_file.xlsx')
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">why not using <code>subprocess</code> library, and use <code>call(["Excel_Software", "arguments"])</code> , this way you can call external program</span>
