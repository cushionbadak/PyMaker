<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm crawling a website and saving selected pages for offline browsing.  Of course the links between pages are broken so I'd like to do something about that.  Is there a somewhat simple way in python to relativize url paths like this without reinventing the wheel:</p>
<pre><code>/folder1/folder2/somepage.html    becomes----&gt;   folder2/somepage.html
/folder1/otherpage.html           becomes----&gt;   ../otherpage.html
</code></pre>
<p>I understand the function would need two url paths to determine the relative path as the linked resource's path is relative to the page it appears on.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>the newer <code>pathlib</code> (only briefly mentioned in the duplicate) also works with urls:</p>
<pre><code>from pathlib import Path

abs_p = Path('https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html')
rel_p = abs_p.relative_to('https://docs.python.org/3/')
print(rel_p)  # library/pathlib.html
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!  This looks promising, however I forgot to mention that I'm using python 2.7 because that is the version installed on mac osx and I want this to be portable.  If nothing else, I might have a look at the source code and pick the bits that I need assuming the source works in 2.7.</span>
