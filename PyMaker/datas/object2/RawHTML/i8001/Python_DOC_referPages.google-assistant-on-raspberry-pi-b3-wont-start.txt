<p>I have tried building the Google Assistant on my Raspberry pi model b3 following this walkthrough 
<a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-pi-python/run-sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-pi-python/run-sample</a></p>
<p>Everything went well until I tried starting it with </p>
<pre><code>google-assistant-demo
</code></pre>
<p>and I get the following stacktrace</p>
<pre><code>    Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/pi/env/bin/google-assistant-demo", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    sys.exit(main())
  File "/home/pi/env/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/google/assistant/__main__.py", line 66, in main
    with Assistant(credentials) as assistant:
  File "/home/pi/env/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/google/assistant/library/assistant.py", line 86, in __init__
    self._event_queue = IterableEventQueue()

    super(IterableEventQueue, self).__init__(maxsize=32)
TypeError: must be type, not classobj
</code></pre>
<p>I don't even know where to start and have not tried any solutions. What could be causing the exception?</p>

<p>As pointed in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-pi-python/run-sample#configure_a_new_python_virtual_environment" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official documentation</a>:
The Google Assistant library currently require <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python &gt; 3.4</a>.</p>
<p>You can configure a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">virtual environments</a> using the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m venv env
env/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
source env/bin/activate
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You didn't configure the venv properly and now it's trying to run on Python 2 instead of 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this did not exactly solve my problem it pointed me in the right direction. The call to 'google-assistant-demo' did invoke python 2 methods. I went through the setup from beginning to end and in each place where a 'python' command was used I replaced it with 'python3' thanks for your help!</span>
