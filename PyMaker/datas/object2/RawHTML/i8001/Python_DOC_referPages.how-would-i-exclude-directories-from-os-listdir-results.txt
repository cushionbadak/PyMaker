<p>I'm making a script that will encode files within a directory using b64/b16 and I'm using os.listdir to do so, but it also lists directories which causes problems since now it's trying to encode directories as if it were a file. </p>
<p>How would I be able to exclude directories from os.listdir results?</p>

dirs = os.listdir(path)
files = []
filecount = 0
fileprogress = 0
for file in dirs:
   files.append(file)
   filecount = filecount + 1

for x in files:
    os.system("cls")
    fileprogress = fileprogress + 1
    print("File " + str(fileprogress) + "/" + str(filecount))
    print("Encrypting " + x + "...")
    inputfile = open(path + "\\" + x, "rb")
    data = inputfile.read()
    inputfile.close()

<p>You can use <code>os.path.isdir</code> function to check if the current file is a directory.</p>
<p>Also, it is much better to use string formatting operations instead of string concatenation: not </p>
<pre><code>print("File " + str(fileprogress) + "/" + str(filecount))
</code></pre>
<p>but</p>
<pre><code>print("File {}/{}".format(fileprogress, filecount))

<span class="comment-copy">do you know the path/name of the module you want to exclude?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm trying to exclude directories from os.listdir results, not a specific directory, just directories in general if that's what you're asking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah... I hoped you were trying to exclude a specific module, and if so, I think <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1668289/3512538">stackoverflow.com/a/1668289/3512538</a> could have helped, but I don't think it will do much good for your situation</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just tried os.path.isdir and that also didn't work, for some reason it won't return true, it still returns false even when it is a directory. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZLn0cHG.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Code</a> returns <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IUmdKEp.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> even though "modded" and "original" are both directories, it also prints out "x6" which is only supposed to happen if it doesn't return true, but it clearly should. Am I using os.path.isdir wrong?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nevermind, I found out the problem. os.path.isdir wants a path, I forgot that I was giving it a filename not a whole path, I just entered the entire path instead and it works fine. Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm having issues with os.walk. It doesn't only list the files in the specified directory, it also checks the sub directories which isn't what I want to do. The format it lists it in seems to be some sort of json style format which also isn't what I want to do, i'd like the results to be in plain text. I made a test directory with one file in it, and instead of just returning the contents of the directory it returned the directory path and the filename in a strange format. &gt;&gt;&gt;('C:\\Users\\Fedora\\Desktop\\Folder', [], ['Test.txt'])</span>
