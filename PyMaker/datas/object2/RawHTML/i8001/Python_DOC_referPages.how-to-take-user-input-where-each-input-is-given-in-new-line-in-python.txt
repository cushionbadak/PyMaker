<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Suppose the user gives input on different lines and each line should be processed differently. Example, if i want to count  number of characters of each user given input. Like,if the user gives input on different line as :</p>
<pre><code>this is first line
this is second line
this is third line
</code></pre>
<p>How can i take each line as a new input and store it somewhere and then do some operation(count number of characters) on each input.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>inputs = [raw_input("enter input data\n") for _ in range(no_of inputs)]
for line in inputs:
   print(len(line))
</code></pre>
