<p>I'm developing a simple TCP chat application server-client to learn Python and I'm not sure about data structures to use. </p>
<p>Server side I've defined <code>client</code> class and its attributes: socket, username, room and online_status. Every client is added to <code>clients</code> list and also, at the same time, its socket is added to <code>connections</code> list.  Server runs in an always-true loop listening for incoming messages using the following declaration</p>
<pre><code>(ready_to_read, _, _) = select.select([server_socket] + list(connections), [], [])
</code></pre>
<p>Is there any way to list every <code>socket</code> of every <code>client</code> objects and do like</p>
<pre><code>(ready_to_read, _, _) = select.select( list(client.socket), [], [])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Unsure that I have really understood what you want, but assuming that you want to build a list of sockets from the list of client instances, you can use a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>(ready_to_read, _, _) = select.select( [client.socket for client in clients], [], [])
</code></pre>
<p>(assuming <code>clients</code> is a list of the client instances)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I see no obvious flaw in what you propose but it does lack context; have you tried your proposed code? As documented <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html#select.select" rel="nofollow noreferrer">select.select</a> does what you are hoping. Guessing from what little is in your question, might you want to generate a list of <code>clients.socket</code>? More code would certainly help your question be answerable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's right. I won't another list called <code>connections</code> when I have a clients class list, the first piece of code is working. My problem is <code>client.socket</code> syntax is not correct, always throws <code>client</code> has no attribute <code>socket</code>. So maybe correct question would be how to list all object instances attributes?</span>
