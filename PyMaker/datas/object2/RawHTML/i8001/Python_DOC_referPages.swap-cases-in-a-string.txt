<p>I'm trying to solve <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/swap-case" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this challenge in hackerrank</a>, which asks to convert all lowercase letters to uppercase letters and vice versa.</p>
<p>I attempt it with the following code: </p>
<pre><code>def swap_case(s):
    length = len(s)
    i=0
    while length:
        if s1[i].isupper():
            s[i].lower()
        elif s[i].islower():
            s[i].upper()
        length-=1
        i+=1
    return s

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input()
    result = swap_case(s)
    print(result)
</code></pre>
<p>However the string returned is the same as it gets passed into the function. Where is the mistake?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.swapcase" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.swapcase</code></a> already does this.</p>
<pre><code>def swap_case(s):
    return s.swapcase()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As said in comments and othe answers, strings are immutable.</p>
<p>Try following:</p>
<pre><code>s = input("Enter input: ")


def convert(ss):
    # Convert it into list and then change it
    newSS = list(ss)
    for i,c in enumerate(newSS):
        newSS[i] = c.upper() if c.islower() else c.lower()
    # Convert list back to string
    return ''.join(newSS)

print(s)
print(convert(s))

# Or use string build in method
print (s.swapcase())
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As @Julien stated in comment <code>upper</code> and <code>lower</code> methods return a copy, and do not change the object itself. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.lower" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this docs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> @aryamccarthy reminded me of already existing feature for this kind of task in python: <code>swapcase()</code> method. See more <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.swapcase" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. Note this also returns a copy of the string.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">strings are not mutable. <code>s[i].upper()</code> returns an uppercase "copy" of <code>s[i]</code>, it doesn't modify <code>s[i]</code> itself. You need to create a new string object entirely...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Like @Julien mentioned, you aren't actually changing the original string. Consider using another variable to hold each new update, and return that new variable instead</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, for what its worth, Python already has a builtin function which does this: <code>str.swapcase()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Worked swiftly. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've upvoted your comment, but unfortunatelly these do not give any reputation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Julien consider adding an elaborated answer. Comments did not increase rep.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Julien If your words were meant as an answer to the question, maybe you should post an answer instead of commenting the question.</span>
