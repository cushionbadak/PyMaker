<p>I'm trying to follow the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installing-without-ui" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documented process for installing Python on Windows without associated UI</a>.</p>
<p>Using <code>c:\path\to\exe /quiet InstallAllUsers=0 PrependPath=1</code> is not working.</p>
<p>When you run the UI install, you can deselect the option for all users which does not require admin rights to install. On my computer, the above works, on others computers, it does not.</p>
<p>The all users check box is defaulted to checked (or <code>1</code>) when I first double click on the .exe; so using the <code>InstallAllUsers=0</code> in the command line should disable or set to <code>0</code> right?</p>

<p>I dont use windows really often but it seems that the default option for <strong>InstallAllUsers</strong> is <strong>0</strong></p>

<p>have you tried without this flag ? </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you; I've edited the question to include that link, and otherwise be a bit more explicit about context.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">According to the docs you posted, <code>0</code> is the default. When you say it is not working, what exactly do you mean by this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MattClark If I opened the .exe by double clicking, the option to install for all users is set to checked (its a check box). So I am trying to use command line to set that to false.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, trying without the flag it is auto-set to all users. So if I double click the .exe, it opens up preselected.</span>
