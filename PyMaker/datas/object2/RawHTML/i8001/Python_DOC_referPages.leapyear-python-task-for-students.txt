<p>new to teaching python to yr10's. This appears to work when telling the end user if their year is a leap year or not. But can someone please confirm if this code is working or the best way to do this. I realise there are probably different methods...Johnny:)</p>
<pre><code>leapYear = int(input("what year is it?:"))

if (leapYear %4) == 0:
    print ("Thats a leap year")

elif (leapYear %100)==0:
    print ("thats not a leap year")

elif (leapYear % 400)== 0:
        print ("Thats a leap year")

else:
    print("thats not a leap year")
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here are three alternative ways to check for a leap year in python, with the 2nd method being an improved version of your own attempt:</p>
<p><strong>1) Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>calendar</code></a>:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import calendar

calendar.isleap(year)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>2) Similar to your own attempt but taking out the redundant steps and converting it into a method:</strong></p>
<pre><code>def is_leap_year(year):
    if year % 100 == 0:
        return year % 400 == 0
    return year % 4 == 0
</code></pre>
<p><strong>3) Check if the year provided has a a 29th of February using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime</code></a>:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import datetime

def is_leap_year(year):
    try:
        datetime.date(year, 2, 29)
    except ValueError:
        return False
    return True
</code></pre>
<p><strong>N.B.</strong> Try to teach your students to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case" rel="nofollow noreferrer">snake_case</a> in python code rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case" rel="nofollow noreferrer">camelCase</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The best way to check if your code is working is to test it. Run it with all kind of inputs and check if it gives the right answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You code has logic errors, it will incorrectly identify <code>100</code> as a leap year. You need to consider the order in which you evaluate your conditions, e.g. if <code>leapYear = 400</code> then it matches all the conditions, which one should be evaluated first?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think your elifs are redundant. Also you don't need the parentheses in your if.</span>
