<p>I have been working on some makefiles which call some python scripts to perform various tasks. Up to now, I had always been <code>make</code>ing on a machine with Ubuntu 16.04 (64 bits) installed. Today, I have tried building on my old 32 bits machine with Lubuntu 16.04 using the same makefile and it fails when calling the Python script.</p>
<p>At first, I thought that my Python version was not new enough, but I also have Python 3.5 installed and I changed the line to <code>python3</code> in the makefile and it still fails:</p>
<pre><code>python3 /home/morane/Documents/Programming/ConnectX/cxPythonTools/RunUnitTests.py -t /home/morane/bin/tests/unit/cxUnitTests.out -l /home/morane/bin/tests/unit/log/unitTests.log
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/morane/RunUnitTests.py", line 41, in &lt;module&gt;
    from subprocess import CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE
ImportError: cannot import name 'CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE'
Makefile:51: recipe for target 'unittests' failed
make: *** [cxbaseunit] Error
</code></pre>
<p>To test, I have tried to repeat the error directly in the Python shell:</p>
<pre><code>Python 3.5.2+ (default, Sep 22 2016, 12:18:14) 
[GCC 6.2.0 20160927] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import subprocess
&gt;&gt;&gt; from subprocess import CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ImportError: cannot import name 'CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE'
</code></pre>
<p>and it still fails. Does anyone know whats going on?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>It appears that you're running in Linux. The <code>CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE</code> constant is only available on Windows.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You are right, but why is it working on my Linux 64 bit OS? I don't even get a warning.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In my intro it says it works on my Ubuntu 64 bit machine. If I am not clear enough please tell me I'll edit it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As for that....I'm not really sure. Do you mind sharing the contents of RunUnitTests.py? Also apologies for the previous comment, I didn't fully read the intro (my bad!).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Of course, here: <a href="https://github.com/BobMorane22/ConnectX/blob/dev/cxPythonTools/RunUnitTests.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/BobMorane22/ConnectX/blob/dev/cxPythonTools/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm...I may be missing something entirely, but it would appear that <code>CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE</code> isn't used in the unit tests file after you import it. Would it be possible to simply remove it?</span>
