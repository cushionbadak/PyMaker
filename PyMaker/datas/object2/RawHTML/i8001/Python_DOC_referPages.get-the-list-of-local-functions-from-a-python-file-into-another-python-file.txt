<p>I have a requirement where I need to parse the functions defined in a python file from another python file.</p>
<p>e.g. I have a python file with following contents:</p>
<pre><code>a.py

import os, sys

def function1('text'):
   pass
def function2('text'):
   pass
</code></pre>
<p>Another file is:
    b.py</p>
<pre><code>interested_func = 'function2'

function_list = &lt;code to fetch the functions defined in a.py&gt;
if interested_func in function_list:
   print 'match found'
</code></pre>
<p>How can I get the functions from a.py into b.py so that I can compare the same with the 'interested_func' data and can do specific task based on the match.</p>
<p>Please note that I have 100s of files with different functions defined inside them, so I do not want to import the file.</p>
<p>Please help, thanks in advance!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should probably use the <code>importlib</code> module:</p>
<pre><code>import importlib

obj = importlib.import_module(module)
print(dir(obj))
</code></pre>
<p>You can read more about importlib over in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python docs</a>.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work for you, then you'll probably want to look at some static code analysis tools such as pylint that might give you a clue into how to do this sort of thing. Another place to look would be to check out PyDev's source code and see how it does code analysis. </p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>import</code>, <code>dir</code>, and <code>callable</code> are your friends</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Dan, I cannot import the file as I have 100 of such files (similar to a.py) and each file having their own set of functions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AMANDEEPSINGH Why can't you import them? Of course you can import them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga, I have shared a snippet of the code which I am writing, In my real application, the module to parse (in this case a.py) is stored in a variable (say module = 'a'). In similar way, with each iteration of my code, the variable changes and the python file to parse also changes, can you please suggest me here..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can import all the required files and then process them as and when you need to call something from a specific file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is the right answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The solution worked. Thanks!</span>
