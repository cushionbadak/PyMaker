<p>I created a game successfully  except I cannot save scores. </p>
<p>I have been trying to save the variable that I use for points to a text file, and have managed that, but would like a way to read it from it when the program launches. </p>
<p>My code for saving it is below. </p>
<pre><code>def Save():
    f.open("DO NOT DELETE!", "w+")
    f.write(str(points))
    f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>I would recommend you to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pickle</a> library.

<p>You can use a <code>try...except...</code> clause to catch <code>FileNotFoundError</code></p>
<pre><code>import pickle as pkl

# to read the highscore:
try:
    with open('saved_scores.pkl', 'rb') as fp:
        highscore = pkl.load(fp) # load the pickle file
except (FileNotFoundError, EOFError): # error catch for if the file is not found or empty
    highscore = 0

# you can view your highscore
    print(highscore, type(highscore)) # thanks to pickle serialization, the type is &lt;int&gt;

# you can modify the highscore
highscore = 10000 # :)

# to save the highscore:
with open('saved_scores.pkl', 'wb') as fp:
    pkl.dump(highscore, fp) # write the pickle file
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What's the problem here? You seem to know how to <code>open</code> and <code>write</code>. Try reading the documentation on <code>read</code> method</span>

<span class="comment-copy">the main problem is that I need to read the file and then set it to a variable. I am struggling with this because if the file does not exist, it is trying to read from a non-existant file. I have tried if statements and everything, but can't get it to work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for this. It isn't quite what I am looking for, but works, and I will keep this in mind if another situation arises. Very useful! :)</span>
