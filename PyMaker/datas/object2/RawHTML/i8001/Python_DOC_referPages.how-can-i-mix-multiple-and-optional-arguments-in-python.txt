<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to write function with default and multiple arguments. Now I have somethink like this:</p>
<pre><code>def make_pizza(size=10, *toppings):
    for t in toppings:
        print("-",t)

    print('Pizza has', size, 'cm')
</code></pre>
<p>and later I try to call:</p>
<pre><code>make_pizza(30, 'pepperoni')
make_pizza('pepperoni')
make_pizza(50, 'cheese', 'cucumber', 'chilli')
</code></pre>
<p>but results looks bad:</p>
<p><code>- pepperoni
Pizza has 30 cm
Pizza has pepperoni cm
- cheese
- cucumber
- chilli
Pizza has 50 cm</code></p>
<p>What should I do, if I want print '10' instead pepperoni in third line?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Well, since you're using Python 3, the easiest is to have <code>size</code> be a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>keyword-only argument</em></a>:</p>
<pre><code>def make_pizza(*toppings, size=10):
    for t in toppings:
       print("-",t)

    print('Pizza has', size, 'cm')
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how the <code>size=10</code> must <em>follow</em> the <code>*toppings</code>.</p>
<p>Now, to specify the <code>size</code> you need to name it explicitly:</p>
<pre><code>make_pizza('pepperoni') 
make_pizza('pepperoni', size=30)
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Another alternative would be to check the <em>type</em> of <code>size</code> and if it is an instance of say <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html#numbers.Number" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>numbers.Number</code></a>, then assume it is the size, otherwise it is a topping, and should be added to the beginning of the <code>toppings</code> tuple... and the size should be reset to default. </p>
<p>Or you could always specify the size. </p>
<p>However I'd prefer the keyword-only arguments as this is exactly the kind of problem they were meant to solve.</p>
