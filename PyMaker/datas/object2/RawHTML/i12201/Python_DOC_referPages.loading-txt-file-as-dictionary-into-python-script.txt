<p>I have a txt file (dictionary.txt) that I would like to load into my script as a dictionary. 
How can I do so? </p>
<p>file dictionary.txt</p>
<pre><code>{'YAL008W': 25, 'YBR255W': 50, 'YGR164W': 37, 'YGR131W': 40, 'YNL003C': 11,
'YBR135W': 2, 'YBR160W': 6, 'YJL082W': 79, 'YJL142C': 4, 'YPL191C': 38,
 'YGL215W': 31, 'YKL074C': 33, 'YJL077C': 67, 'YKL096W-A': 22, 'YIL124W': 60,
 'YLR364C-A': 2, 'YPL039W': 58, 'YNL170W': 16, 'YGL141W': 62, 'YJL179W': 15,
 'YDR316W-A': 13, 'YDR316W-B': 139, 'YKL083W': 25, 'YOR009W': 25,

 'YIL062C': 2, 'YCL023C': 27}
</code></pre>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>f=open('dictionary.txt', 'r') 

with f as dic1:
     dictionary1=eval(dic1.read())   
</code></pre>
<p>This inputs it as a dictionary, but I was wondering if there is a faster way to do so. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's unlikely to be faster, or slower, but you can make it much more secure by avoiding <code>eval</code> (which can execute arbitrary code, which makes for a major security and stability risk) in favor of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow"><code>ast.literal_eval</code></a>; it's like <code>eval</code>, but only for Python literals, not arbitrary code. Depending on format, you might also be able to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load" rel="nofollow"><code>json.load</code></a> or <code>json.loads</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your <code>dictionary.txt</code> is almost JSON, so I would recommend something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import json
with open('dictionary.txt') as data_file:
    data = data_file.read()
# Convert single quotes to double quotes to get JSON syntax
data = data.replace('\'', '"')
data = json.loads(data)
for key, val in data.iteritems():
    print "%s = %s" % (key, val)
</code></pre>
<p>For your <code>dictionary.txt</code>, this outputs</p>
<pre><code>YOL034W = 29
YAL008W = 25
...
YKL052C = 20
</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: Ellipses have been used to abbreviate the output.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I just edited my question. hope that helps</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is this data in a known format? For example, is it supposed to be valid JSON? How was the data created?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I created the data myself. The keys are gene names and values are integer count of reads that mapped to the gene. I created an empty dictionary, saved all gene names into keys and then had a for loop run through and add appropriate number of times a read was mapped to the gene. The dictionary was saved as a .txt file with sys.stdout @BryanOakley</span>
