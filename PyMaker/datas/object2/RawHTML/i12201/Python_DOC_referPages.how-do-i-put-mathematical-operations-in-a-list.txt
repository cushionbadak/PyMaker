<p>I need to make my code as short as possible and I need to put * - + in a list like this: op = [*,-,+]</p>
<p>It gives me a syntax error... I know I can put them as strings but is that the only way? My program picks a random operator from that list and makes a sum out of it, eg, sum = num1 op num2</p>
<p>my code:</p>
<pre><code>import random

opL = [*,-,+]

def mathsQuiz(number1,operator,number2):
    sum1=number1,operator,number2
    print(sum1)

number1 = random.randint(1,12)
number2 = random.randint(1,12)
operator = random.choice(opL)

mathsQuiz(number1,operator,number2)

<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#module-operator" rel="nofollow">operator</a> module and create a dictionary instead that will map out your operators:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import operator
&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; opL = {"*": operator.mul, "-": operator.sub, "+": operator.add}
&gt;&gt;&gt; opL.get(random.choice(list(opL)))(1,2)

opL = operator.mul, operator.sub, operator.add

<span class="comment-copy"><i>"I need to make my code as short as possible"</i> - why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or <code>opL.get(random.choice(opL))(1,2)</code>, since the OP wants to randomly select some operator.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do i randomize which operator is chosen?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah thanks !!!!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DilsaajanDuggal Look at the updated solution. For my solution you will need to get the <code>keys()</code> to extract the operator you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Py3 problem perhaps? Probably better to do <code>opL.get(random.choice(list(opL)))</code>, which should work in both Py2 and Py3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perhaps you should explain.  Since the OP already has a variable named <code>operator</code>, he is apt to be confused by your post.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If I wanted to explain, there would have been an explanation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you didn't want to explain, perhaps you shouldn't have answered.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In that case you can't be mad if people downvote this as unhelpful.</span>
