<p>I would like to write random prime numbers in new lines to a text file, but when I run my script it writes all numbers in one line. It's very likely that I don't understand something correctly.</p>
<p>This is my original code:</p>
<pre><code>import random
file = open("prime.txt", "w")
i = 0
while( i&lt;=100 ):
    temp=str(random.randint(1, 500) )
    file.writelines(temp)
    i += 1
file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>According to the answers, I just have to use the <code>write()</code> method with newline character (<code>\n</code>) instead of the <code>writelines()</code> method.</p>
</div>

<p>You can just add a newline when writing each number to the file. Also use <code>file.write()</code> instead of <code>file.writelines()</code>. Just use this as your code:</p>
<pre><code>import random
file = open("primes.txt", "w")
i=0
while(i&lt;=100):
    temp=str(random.randint(1,500))
    file.write(temp  + "\n")  #add a newline after each number
    i+=1
file.close()
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.writelines" rel="nofollow"><code>writelines</code></a> doesn't add line separators (which seems weird considering <code>readlines</code> removes them).  You'll have to add them manually.</p>
<pre><code>lines = ['{0}\n'.format(random.randint(1,500)) for i in range(100)]
file.writelines(lines)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to pass a sequence to writelines, you can use a generator expression and also use <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm" rel="nofollow"><code>with</code></a> to open your files replacing your while loop with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range" rel="nofollow">range</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import random
with  open("prime.txt", "w") as f:
   f.writelines(str(random.randint(1,500))+"\n" for _ in range(100))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Since you're only writing one string at atime, I think you just want <code>file.write(temp + "\n")</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">the answer that CollinD gave should work for you, for more info you can check <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13730107/writelines-writes-lines-without-newline-just-fills-the-file">this</a> out</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In your example, you want to use simply <code>file.write()</code>  writelines() is for a sequence of strings.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much. I was not sure about using write() and writelines().</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A little pedantic, but it's expecting any sequence of strings, not just a list. =)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BrendanAbel, yep thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! It seems really useful.</span>
