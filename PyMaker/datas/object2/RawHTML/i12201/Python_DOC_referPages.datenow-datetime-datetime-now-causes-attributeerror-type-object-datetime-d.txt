<p>Trying to figure out how to get the current date to lock in as a variable to subtract from the self.birthday that is input. I have looked at various examples and links to no avail...suggestions?</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime
import time

class Person(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.birthday = None


#getName returns the name of the person         
    def getName(self):
        return self.name

#setBirthday sets their Birthday to a date
    def setBirthday(self):
        day = raw_input('Please enter the date of the month you were born on here -&gt;')
        month = raw_input('Please enter the month of the year you were born on here -&gt;')
        year = raw_input('Please enter the year you were born on here -&gt;')
        self.birthday = int(day),  int(month), int(year)
        print self.birthday

#getAge returns how many days old the individual is     
    def getAge(self):
        dateNow = datetime.datetime.now()
        dateBirth = self.birthday
        timedelta = dateNow - dateBirth
        timedelta = self.daysOld
        print self.daysOld
</code></pre>
<p>Error message is "dateNow = datetime.datetime.now()
AttributeError: type object 'datetime.datetime' has no attribute 'datetime'"</p>
<p>I have tried the following</p>
<pre><code>datetime.date.today() 
</code></pre>
<p>with no success</p>
<p>resources I'm using:</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>datetime.datetime.now()</code> refers to a method (<code>now</code>) of a class (2nd <code>datetime</code>) of a library (1st <code>datetime</code>), however you didn't import the entire library, just the single class (<code>from datetime import datetime</code>). Either import the entire library or call on the class without referring to the library.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try</p>
<pre><code>n= date.today()
</code></pre>
<p>I will give you the current date in string format then use <code>split()</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried <code>datetime.now()</code> since you are already importing <code>datetime.datetime</code> as <code>datetime</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">datetime.now() AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'now'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">now I'm getting this error...timedelta = dateNow - dateBirth TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'datetime.datetime' and 'tuple' , so I need to probably cast the data I would think..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok casting as a string didn't work...suggestions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The other variable also needs to be a <code>datetime</code> object for time addition/subtraction.</span>
