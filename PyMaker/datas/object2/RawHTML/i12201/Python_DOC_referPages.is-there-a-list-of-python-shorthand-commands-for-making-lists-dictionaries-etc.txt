<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I know about <code>foo = []</code> being shorthand for <code>foo = list()</code> and I was wondering if there was a list of shorthand notations for creating empty dictionaries, tuples, sets, etc. I'm specifically looking for Python 3.x but either one would be useful to have.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To create an empty dictionary, use <code>{}</code>.<br/>
To create an empty tuple, use <code>()</code>.<br/>
There is no shortcut for an empty set.
As for the <em>etc.</em>, I don't know what else you are thinking of.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>[]</code> is not shorthand. It is 'literal notation', and faster. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/30216000">Why is [] faster than list()?</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">But please go to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a> for basic questions like these. It covers all the basics, including <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">literal notations for data structures</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for pointing me to that question, I'll have to give that a read. I also didn't know it was considered a literal (though I probably should have realized) I must be blind if I didn't see the literals in the docs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because the notation for containers is more complex than for strings, integers, etc, you find those defined as <i>displays</i>, in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#displays-for-lists-sets-and-dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>Expressions</i> section</a>.</span>
