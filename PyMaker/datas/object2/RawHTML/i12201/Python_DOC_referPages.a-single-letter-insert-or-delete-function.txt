<p>Write a function named single_insert_or_delete that accepts two strings as input arguments and returns:</p>
<p>0 if the two strings match exactly.
1 if the first string can become the same as the second string by inserting or deleting a single character. Notice that inserting and deleting a character is not the same as replacing a character.
2 otherwise</p>

<p>thats what i reached so far</p>
<pre><code>def single_insert_or_delete (word1,word2):
    word1=word1.lower()
    word2=word2.lower()
    limit=min(len(word1),len(word2))
    list1=[]
    list2=[]
    common=[]
    if word1==word2:
        return 0
    for i in range(0,len(word1)):
        list1.append(word1[i])
    for k in range(0,len(word2)):
        list2.append(word2[k])
    if abs(len(word1)-len(word2))==1:
        for c in range(0,limit+1):
            if list1[c]==list2[c] or list1[c]==list2[c+1] or   list1[c+1]==list2[c]:
                return 1
            else:
                return 2
    else:
         return 2
</code></pre>
<p>It actually works good but if you tried tricky words like 'the' and 'that' it will give 1 instead of 2 which is wrong</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You may have to return outside the for loop and recheck the comparison logic in if.</p>
<p>for c in range(0,limit+1):</p>
<pre><code>        if (list1[c]==list2[c] or list1[c]==list2[c+1] or list1[c+1]==list2[c]):
              return 1
</code></pre>
<p>The problem here is, when the words(the and this) are compared, it satisfies the first condition of t being equal to t and it enters the if condition where it returns 1 and exits the function. It will not proceed with the for loop.</p>
<p>If you want something similar rather than difflib, you may also use the following code.</p>
<pre><code>import numpy


def single_insert_or_delete(s1,s2):

    s1 = s1.lower()
    s2 = s2.lower()

    l1 = [i for i in s1] # convert the string into an array
    l2 = [j for j in s2] # convert the second string in an array

    if s1 == s2:
        flag = 0

    elif abs(len(s1)-len(s2)) == 1:
        if len(l2) &gt; len(l1):
            l1,l2 = l2,l1
        l3 = list(numpy.in1d(l1,l2)) 
    # This will compare the elements of 2 arrays and return bool values based on the match

        if l3.count(False) &gt; 1: # count the number of false values
            flag = 2
        else:
            flag = 1
    else:
        flag = 2

    return flag

<p>I'm not sure if you want to work out <em>how</em> to do it, or whether you just want to solve it, but if the latter you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html#difflib.ndiff" rel="nofollow"><code>difflib.ndiff()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from difflib import ndiff

    return change_count

<span class="comment-copy">@MahmoodHatemMito No, an image is not a question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MahmoodHatemMito Please <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/35598736/edit">edit</a> your question and ask the question there. Don't use comments for this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">mmmm, yeah you are absolutely right, so my algorithm needs some fix  thanks alot  bro :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the fix exactly?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I thought you were just looking for the problem. If I was you, I would definitely use difflib just as suggested by @mhawke .Thats pretty simple and gets the job done with minimum loc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KaranThakkar . Edited with updated working code snippet.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OMG, Actually i am a beginner i have just started learning this couple of weeks ago , so i am not familiar with difflib package but you definitely nailed it :)  i just wanted to know whats wrong with my algorithem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MahmoodHatemMito: if you just wanted to know what is wrong with your algorithm then you probably should not accept this answer :) This answer shows another way of doing with the standard library - it's interesting, but perhaps not what you wanted. Note that you did not actually ask a question at all :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks alot bro you are the best :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MahmoodHatemMito: .... you may wish to replace the acceptance with an upvote instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i still cant vote unfortunately , its my first day in this site</span>
