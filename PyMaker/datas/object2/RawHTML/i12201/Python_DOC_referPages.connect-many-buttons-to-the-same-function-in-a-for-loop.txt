<p>I have about 25-30 Buttons which I must to connect to the same function. I don't like to do this all manually by writing </p>
<pre><code>self.__mybutton_1.clicked.connect(self.__MyConnectedFunction)
</code></pre>
<p>All my buttons have the same naming layout, so the next button would be <code>__mybutton_2</code>. I want to do something like that</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    self.__mybutton_i.clicked.connect(self.__MyConnectedFunction)
</code></pre>
<p>Is something like this possible in python and how to do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's possible, but not recommended.  You <em>can</em> use <code>eval("self.__mybutton_{}".format(i)).connect(self.__MyConnectedFunction)</code>, but it would be better to create a list of your buttons and use <code>buttons[i]</code> instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If all the buttons are children of the same widget/window, you could use the <a href="http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/qobject.html#findChildren-3" rel="nofollow"><code>QObject.findChildren</code></a> method to dynamically get a list of the buttons:</p>
<pre><code>btns = self.findChildren(QtGui.QPushButton, QtCore.QRegExp(r'__mybutton_\d+'))
for btn in btns:
    btn.connect(self._MyConnectedFunction)
</code></pre>
<p>This also assumes you're setting the <code>objectName</code> of the buttons to the same name as their python variable name (which <code>.ui</code> files should already do).</p>
<p>This has the benefit that you can add more buttons in the future and as long as you stick to the naming convention (<code>__my_button_#</code>), the connection code will automatically connect it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, you can do exactly what you want using <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow">getattr</a>:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    button = getattr(self, '__mybutton_%s' % i)
    button.clicked.connect(self.__MyConnectedFunction)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I know that a list will be the better option. I am new in QT and using Wx until now and I'm very happy with the QT Designer. There I have lot of buttons, not in a list...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, if you really <i>can't</i> use a list, the <code>eval()</code> function should work.</span>
