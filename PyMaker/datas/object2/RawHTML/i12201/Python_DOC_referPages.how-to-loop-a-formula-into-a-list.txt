<p>I am new to coding and my spelling is not the best but I need help with something, I am trying to loop a formula to make a sequence that is stored in a list. Here is my code so far;</p>
<pre><code> for i in range(list):
        number1 = number63*number99
        number2 = number1*number33
        number3 =(number2*number34)+(number64*number35)
        total = number1 + number2 + number3
</code></pre>
<p>don't worry about the variables they are completely irrelevant as they only make sense to me but i just was to know how i could do this.</p>

<p>Is this what you want to do?</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(list):
        number1 = number63*number99
        number2 = number1*number33
        number3 =(number2*number34)+(number64*number35)
        total += [number1] + [number2] + [number3]
</code></pre>
<p>This will make <code>total</code> a list which adds the three numbers to it each loop iteration</p>
<p>An alternative is to use <code>extend</code>:</p>
<pre><code>total.extend([number1, number2, number3])
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that for both of these methods, you need to initialize <code>total</code> somewhere earlier in your code, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>total = []
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, you are using the <a href="http://pythoncentral.io/pythons-range-function-explained/" rel="nofollow"><code>range</code> function wrong</a>. If you want to iterate the length of a list, do <code>range(0,len(lst))</code>. Please also note that using the variable name <code>list</code> is ill-advised as it is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list" rel="nofollow">a built-in function</a> in Python.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Which variable should be a list? You might want to check the <code>append()</code> method for lists.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Would you add a Simple Input output example please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can't get your question really. Can you give an example what your code should achieve?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">perhaps you want to create <code>answer = []</code> before your for-loop and then <code>answer.append(total)</code> within your loop</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I am getting an error about the (list) why is that? All i have done is created a list at the top of the program like this 'list = [ ] "</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PortableGibbon this is because you are not using the <code>range</code> function correctly. I've edited my answer for detail</span>
