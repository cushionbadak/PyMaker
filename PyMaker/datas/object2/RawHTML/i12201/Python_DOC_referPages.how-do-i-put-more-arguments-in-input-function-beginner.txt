<p>Say I have a variable <code>computer_guess</code> and <code>player_answer</code> that is assigned a value.</p>
<p>I wanna be able to do this:</p>
<pre><code>player_answer = input("is this your number?",computer_guess)
</code></pre>
<p>I want the (<code>"is this your number?"</code>) to be on the same line with the variable <code>computer_guess</code>.</p>
<p>Is this achievable??</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

<p>Sure, use <code>str.join()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>player_answer = input(" ".join(("is this your number?", computer_guess)))
</code></pre>
<p>You could also just concatenate:</p>
<pre><code>player_answer = input("is this your number?" + computer_guess)
</code></pre>
<p>For both of those solutions, <code>computer_guess</code> needs to be a string.  If it is not, use <code>str(computer_guess)</code> instead.  You could also do this:</p>
<pre><code>player_answer = input("is this your number? {}".format(computer_guess))
</code></pre>
<p>That last will work for any type.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Look into string formatting, e.g. <code>input("Is this your number - {0}?".format(computer_guess))</code>, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Format String Syntax</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AChampion: Thank you for pointing that out; I have corrected it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you very much. I have used the last line of code you suggested, the variables are not strings. I just wanted to ask you about the .format part. could you give me a bit of information about it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">format</a> is a string method that is used for inserting certain things inside a string.  For example, <code>"My name is {}; my hair color is {}".format("Zondo", "brown")</code> would result in <code>"My name is Zondo; my hair color is brown"</code>.  In format strings, braces are used to mean that something else is supposed to go here.  You can also number your braces: <code>"My name is {0}; my hair color is {1}".format(...)</code>.  You can also use keys: <code>"My name is {name}; my hair color is {color}"</code>.  In that case, you need this: <code>"...".format(name="Zondo"...)</code></span>
