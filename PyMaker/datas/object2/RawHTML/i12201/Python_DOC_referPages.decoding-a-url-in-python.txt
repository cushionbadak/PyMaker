<p>Can somebody explain how to decode <a href="http://members.coderdojosv.org/connect?arc=jTrZ5%2A6%287&amp;cdb=X%5Byew%27%3C%26%3E%28" rel="nofollow">this</a> in Python?</p>
<p>I already tried:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib

&gt;&gt;&gt; some_string='arc=jTrZ5%2A6%287&amp;cdb=X%5Byew%27%3C%26%3E%28'
&gt;&gt;&gt; urllib.parse.unquote(urllib.parse.unquote(some_string))
</code></pre>
<p>and I got this: </p>
<pre><code>arc=jTrZ5*6(7&amp;cdb=X[yew'&lt;&amp;&gt;(
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The description for unquote is "Replace %xx escapes by their single-character equivalent" (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html</a>). You can check the results using this site: <a href="http://www.degraeve.com/reference/urlencoding.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.degraeve.com/reference/urlencoding.php</a>.  Using the first sequence, %2A you can see that it resolves to '*'.  The last enclosing call to 'unquote' essentially does nothing except echo the previous result.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you unquote twice?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this does not tell us anything...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Seekheart -What do you mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zondo - I found it on a different Stack Overflow place.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, as DavidHisting mentioned, it is useless.  That is like translating German into English and then translating <i>that</i> into English.  The second translation is useless because it's already in the right language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, I realized that this is not UTF-8 encryption. Sigh. I'll just accept the solution of @David Histing.</span>
