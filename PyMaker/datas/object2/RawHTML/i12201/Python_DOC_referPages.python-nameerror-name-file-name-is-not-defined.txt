<p>I'm attempting to write a simple script that will take a filename from the command line and convert that file to a another format. Below is a small simple snippet of code that I am starting with but I keep getting this error:
<code>NameError: name 'file_name' is not defined</code></p>
<p>Here is the code, i'm on a Mac using python 2.7.10.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Convert Hex Files')
parser.add_argument('-f', dest=file_name, help='Please Enter the Path to Your File.', type=string)
parser.add_argument('-n', dest=line_length, help='Enter The Desired Line Length.', type=int)
args = parser.parse_args()

print args.file_name
print args.line_length
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In the argparse module, the destinations must be strings.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to quote the vales that you are assigning to dest.</p>
<pre><code>dest = "file_name"
dest = "line_length"
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#dest" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> of this option for full details.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you this worked, I should've read the API more closely. I also had to remove the 'type=string' because it's a string by default as you mentioned.</span>
