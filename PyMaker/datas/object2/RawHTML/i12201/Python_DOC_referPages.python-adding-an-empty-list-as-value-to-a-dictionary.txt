<p>I want to append an empty list as the value when the name_input is not empty and grade_input is empty to a dictionary, whose keys are the name_input. The following is the code snippet. But it doesn't seem to work. Any suggestions?</p>
<pre><code>if (name_input != '' and grade_input ==''):
        name_dic[name_input].append([])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>.append()</code> method applies to lists, not dictionaries.</p>
<p>To add a new key/value pair to a dictionary, simply do this:</p>
<pre><code>name_dic[name_input] = []
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't append to a dictionary. Just do this: <code>name_dic[name_input] = []</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have only one grade_input for each name_input? A dict of empty lists doesn't seem very useful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're trying to initialize as an empty list, you can try using a <code>defaultdict</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html?highlight=collections#collections.defaultdict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As ldjaw commented earlier.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't necessarily need square brackets on the right side of assignment when assigning values.</span>
