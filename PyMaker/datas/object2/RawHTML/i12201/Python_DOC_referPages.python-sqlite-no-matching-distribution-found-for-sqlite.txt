<p>I tried to install that library by pip in console. I'm using win7 and python v. 2.7.10. But failed to achive. Acording to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22976019/how-to-get-table-name-of-the-executed-query-python-sqlite">this</a> - It can be used for my version of python too.</p>
<p>I tried to install by several ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pip install sqlite</p>
<p>pip install sqlite3</p>
<p>pip install sqlite-devel</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is wrong here?</p>
<pre><code>    Full error: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement(). 
No matching distribution found for ...

<p>What makes you think you need to install this? sqlite is part of the standard library, and does not need installing.</p>

<p>I had similar issue in RHEL7.4 
it worked with below solution </p>
<p>If you compiled and installed Python 3 yourself, install the dependencies (<strong>libsqlite3-dev</strong> or <strong>sqlite-devel</strong> or similar, depending on your Linux distribution, for example), then re-compile and re-install Python 3.</p>
<p>after installing the <strong>sqlite-devel</strong> I have reinstall Python3.6 on my machine using below steps</p>
<ol>
<li>download wget <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.3/Python-3.6.3.tar.xz" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.3/Python-3.6.3.tar.xz</a></li>
<li>tar xvf Python-3.6.3.tar.xz</li>
<li>cd Python-3.6.3 and then run ./configure</li>
<li>make</li>
<li>make install </li>
</ol>
<p>after doing this when I launch <strong><em>jupyter notebook</em></strong> it got launch </p>

<p>Another simple solution would be </p>
<p><code>pip install pysqlite</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Because I dont have such lib installed. <code>import sqlite</code> - doesn't work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The stdlib module is called sqlite3. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ops, you right, thank you)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because the package <code>sqlite3</code> (in the standard library) has problems. Try compiling a sqlite3 python program with cx_Freeze, and you'll get a DLL not found error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm new to python, django..I'm working on Python-Django project, I have been facing the same error even after installing sqlite-devel I'm getting this error "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_sqlite3' "</span>
