<p>I am new to python. I am just opening a file and writing some text into it. Later reading the content find all the characters in it by using regular expression.  but I am getting the error as 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'. if I use readlines also, I am getting the error.</p>

<p>The <code>file.write()</code> method returns <code>None</code> in Python 2 (in Python 3 it returns the number of bytes written, for a binary file).</p>
<p>If you want to both write and read with the same file you'll need to open that file in <code>w+</code> mode, and <em>seek back</em> to put the file position back to the start:</p>
<pre><code>with open('sevi.txt', 'w+b') as fileobj:
    fileobj.write("Cats are smarter than dogs")
    fileobj.seek(0)  # move back to the start
    for line in fileobj: 
        match = re.findall('[A-Z]+', line)
        print match
</code></pre>
<p>Note that looping over the file object can be done directly, producing individual lines.</p>
<p>I made two other changes: I renamed your variable to <code>fileobj</code>; you have a file object, not just the name of the file here. And I used the file object as a context manager, so that it is closed automatically even if any errors occur in the block.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>filename.write("Cats are smarter than dogs")</code> is the function that returns <code>None</code> type like every function in Python if it's not specified otherwise with a <code>return</code> statement. So the value of the variable <code>content</code> is <code>None</code> and You are trying to read from that. Try <code>filename.read()</code> instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>filename.write()</code> returns <code>None</code> in Python 2. Did you mean to use <code>filename.read()</code> instead? You'll need to open the file in <code>w+</code> mode to be able to do that though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i am getting the error as None Traceback (most recent call last):   File ".\mud.txt", line 12, in &lt;module&gt;     for line in content.read(): AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">FWIW, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>open</code></a> function takes a file name string and returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object" rel="nofollow noreferrer">file object</a>, so calling that file object <code>filename</code> is somewhat confusing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but it is printing as : ['Z', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z'] ['Z'] ['X', 'P', 'R', 'C', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'C'] ['B', 'E', 'BCDEFGHIH', 'NOPQRSTUK', 'Z', 'N', 'Q', 'T', 'W', 'Z', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R'] ['I'] ['V', 'E', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'C', 'P', 'Y', 'S', 'C']</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sam: Yes, isn't that what you expected? You didn't tell us anything about what you were trying to do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sam: your <code>find_all()</code> call finds all groups of uppercase letters and returns a list of them. So if your text includes only individual <code>Z</code> initials, that's what you get returned.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if i want to search for specifi word in my .txt (example - smarter). then what should i do ? . If i want to find only letters within my .txt.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sam: that's an entirely new problem, separate from your question, and too broad to answer in comments.</span>
