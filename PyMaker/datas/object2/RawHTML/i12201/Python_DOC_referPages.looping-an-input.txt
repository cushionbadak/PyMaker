<p>I am trying to write a program that asks the user to type in a sentence, than it asks them to repeat it however times they desire, but I am having trouble. This is what I have so far, but I don't know what to do next or add to it. I just need help trying to repeat the sentence that outputs according to the amount that's inputted.</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    sentence= input("Enter a sentence: ")
    x= input("Specify how many times to print it: ")
    for x in range():
            print(sentence)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to loop x times, not change x as a loop counter.</p>
<pre><code>for n in range(int(x)):
        print(sentence)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do this:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    sentence= input("Enter a sentence: ")
    x = ""
    while not x.isdigit():
        input("Specify how many times to print it: ")
    for _ in range(int(x)):
        print(sentence)
</code></pre>
<p>Yours doesn't work for two reasons: <code>input()</code> returns a string, not an integer; and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow">range()</a> requires at least one argument.</p>
