<p>I have seen similar questions, my is little bit more practical, I would like to iterate over range of week days over and over again.</p>
<p>So far my iterator is not cyclic, help me please to resolve this. </p>
<pre><code>def day_generator():
    for w in ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']:
        yield w;

g = day_generator()
print g.next()

<p>You can use itertool's cycle:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle</a></p>
<pre><code>import itertools
def day_generator():
    days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']
    for day in itertools.cycle(days):
        yield day
</code></pre>
<p>Long story short(and as mentioned in comments) it is really enough to make:</p>
<pre><code>day_generator = itertools.cycle(days)
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks @FlavianHautbois</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You almost had it, you just needed to put your "yield" statement in an endless loop, so that it will always wrap around when needed:</p>
<pre><code>def day_generator():
    while True:
        for w in ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']:
            yield w

g = day_generator()
for _ in range(10):
    print(next(g))

##Output:
##
##    Monday
##    Tuesday
##    Wednesday
##    Thursday
##    Friday
##    Saturday
##    Sunday
##    Monday
##    Tuesday
##    Wednesday
</code></pre>
<p>However, as others have noted, <code>itertools.cycle</code> is the most concise way to do it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle" rel="nofollow">itertools.cycle</a> does exactly what you want:</p>
<pre><code>import itertools

day_generator = itertools.cycle(['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Your code is not valid Python, your function has no arguments... Plus you use a function for nothing, you could have just written <code>day_generator = itertools.cycle(days)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I tried to adapt my code to mentioned in the answer. Will update it to reduce confusing.  I think that main point here is <code>cycle</code> method</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It sure is. I made an edit in the mean time</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FlavianHautbois updated)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now you kind of ripped off an earlier response, not cool</span>
