<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am totally new to python, so my question may seem stupid. 
Basically I need to ask the user to determine a working directory, create a folder in that address, and then run the rest of script. 
I know how to get the directory, but I do not know how to use it in my script.</p>
<pre><code>import Tkinter, tkFileDialog
root = Tkinter.Tk()
root.withdraw()
directory= tkFileDialog.askdirectory()
</code></pre>
<p>and I need to create a folder in that address, so I try this:</p>
<pre><code>os.mkdir (directory/map)
</code></pre>
<p>But I got error message:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\Desktop\run_aermap_script_c - train.py", line 39, in &lt;module&gt;
    os.mkdir (directory/map_C)
NameError: name 'map_C' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. 
Best,</p>

<p>The <code>NameError: name X is not defined</code> occurs when Python can't find X as a variable name. So that tells you that Python is looking for a <em>variable</em> named X. However, you don't define X as a variable (at least in the code you posted). You want X to be part of a path name, which should be a string. I'd suggest you read up on Python string behavior and how to build longer strings from shorter ones.</p>

<p><code>askdirectory()</code> returns the full path of an existing directory.  If you want to create a new directory/folder named 'map-C` within that existing directory, then use</p>
<pre><code>os.mkdir(os.path.join(directory, 'map-C'))
</code></pre>
<p>"If the directory already exists, OSError is raised." (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.mkdir" rel="nofollow">mkdir doc</a>)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you add the error message you get to the question, please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If there is but one single thing you learn from the experience of posting this question, please let it be that you must <b>always provide the error message</b> when asking for help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cjrh And preferably the <b>full traceback</b> in the case of a python exception.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Here is the error message: Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:\Users\Desktop\run_aermap_script_c - train.py", line 39, in &lt;module&gt;     os.mkdir (directory/map_C) NameError: name 'map_C' is not defined</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>os.mkdir</code> takes a <code>string</code> so <code>directory/map_C</code> needs to be a string or variables containing strings combined eg. <code>'hello' + 'world'</code> = <code>'helloword'</code></span>
