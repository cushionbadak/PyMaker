<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code> lista = [100, 200, 300]
 listb = [10, 20, 30]
</code></pre>
<p>Using python 2.7, if I want to define a function that would take the first element from list a and add it to the first element of list b, and then iterate through the lists in this manner, how would I do so? Is there a way to set up the function that it could do this for any number of lists?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use list comprehension in combination with <code>zip</code>. <code>zip</code> combines the two lists, allowing you to sum its elements:</p>
<pre><code>[a+b for a,b in zip(lista, listb)]
</code></pre>
<p>Your method would simply look like this</p>
<pre><code>def method(lista,listb):
    return [a+b for a,b in zip(lista, listb)]
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you prefer the MapReduce paradigm you can also use <code>map</code> in combination with the <code>add</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code>from operator import add
def method (lista, listb):
    return map(add,lista,listb)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The general solution:</p>
<pre><code>list_a = [1, 2, 3]
list_b = [5, 7, 9]
list_c = [100, 200, 300]

lists = [list_a, list_b, list_c]

print [sum(k) for k in zip(*lists)] # [106, 209, 312]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Stackoverflow is not a code writing service, start by writing a function that takes your lists as parameters and go from there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. As a beginner, thoughts on how I would come across zip? That is exactly what I was looking for but I did not see that in the documentation or by google searching.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are plenty of online Python courses that walk you through concrete examples. That is generally a good starting point, if you get stuck with an implementation, you can also ask further questions here. I followed this course, but there are plenty more available: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032" rel="nofollow noreferrer">udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built-in functions</a> page of the documentation is worth a read.</span>
