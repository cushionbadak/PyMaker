<p>I am new to python. I just write a server-client program to achieve multiple clients chatting in a room using command line to receive conversation and get input from type. The problem is in the client end. When I am typing, if new words coming from another client, my typing is becoming to be appended. It is like the data I received is appended to what I am typing.</p>
<p>What I used in client reading is:</p>
<pre><code>print(myDate)
</code></pre>
<p>What I used to display new conversation on command line is:</p>
<pre><code>myDate = input()
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You are confusing input and output.</p>
<p>If you are using a multi-threaded client, one thread writing to the <code>stdout</code> output will be intermingled with another thread taking input on <code>stdin</code> and showing what is being typed with the standard input echo.</p>
<p>Any characters typed for the <code>input()</code> call are echoed to <code>stdout</code> and that is mixed with anything else being written to <code>stdout</code> at the same time.</p>
<p>This does <em>not</em> mean that the actual return value of <code>input()</code> is going to contain anything other than what the end user typed.</p>
<p>You'll have to build a more sophisticated terminal-based UI to keep <code>stdout</code> and input echo separated. Something like <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html" rel="nofollow"><code>curses</code></a> could work, but this requires some sophistication.</p>
