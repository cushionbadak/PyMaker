<p>I want the program to take in the number by input (like school grades) and calculate the average. But it should quit when I put in the grade 0.</p>
<p>like:</p>
<pre><code>Grade:3
Grade:5
Grade:0
The average grade is 3.86


while  1&lt;2:
    x = input("Grade:")
        x += x        #unsure about the algoritm
break x = 0
      y=x/?            #how to count the amont of loops
      print "The average grade is",y
</code></pre>

<p>As it looks like homework, I'll show you the concepts.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You have to sum up the values in a separate variable which you set to 0 at the start. You do the same with another variable where you count.</p>
<p>Put the commands</p>
<pre><code>total = 0
count = 0
total += x
count += 1
</code></pre>
<p>where they seem useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix your indenting.</p></li>
<li><p>This is not how <code>break</code> works. Instead, put it as a command in an <code>if</code> clause where you check the value of <code>x</code>.</p></li>

<span class="comment-copy">Your code is <i>completely</i> broken.  Is this simply an attempt to demonstrate <i>attempt</i>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>x+=x;</code> does it work given how you take the input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You look <i>very</i> new to Python &amp; programming in general. First take your time to <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read through this</a> before attempting to actually complete a task. Right now, it's a bit like you're trying to do the LeMans without first getting your driver's license. The book <i>Learning Python</i>, by Mark Lutz is also very good for beginning programmers (but not free, and there are other books as well).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 for guiding and not writing a full code.</span>
