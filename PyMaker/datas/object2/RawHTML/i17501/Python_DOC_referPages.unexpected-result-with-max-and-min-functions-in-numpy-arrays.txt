<p>I have some troubles with <code>numpy arrays</code> and I don't know if it is my computer(I'm having some problems with it) or something else.
At the moment when I introduce the following I these get unexpected results:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
names=np.array(['jungle', 'mountain', 'sea', 'lake', 'forest', 'desert', 'house',
 'city', 'mountain'], dtype='&lt;U20')
max(names)
'sea'
min(names)
'city'
</code></pre>
<p>It should be "mountain" the maximum and "sea" the minimum 
Can anyone reproduce this? Or it is my computer :(</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Strings are compared by the code point of each letter (starting with the first letter, until there is a difference):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "AAAAA" &lt; "B"
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; "a" &gt; "A"
True
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to compare by length instead of case-sensitive "lexicographical" order, use <code>key=len</code> as a second argument:</p>
<pre><code>max(names, key=len)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Note that it's sorting it alphabetically now (with lowercase letters getting sorted before uppercase).  You probably knew that, but it doesn't hurt to be explicit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CodyPiersall, I didn't know it. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, so it doesn't detect automatic that is a string a change to measure the length. There is any documentation about that? in <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max</a> I found the key argument but I didn't know how it works. (I can't mark now the question I will do it later)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Llopis: All iterators (and strings are iterators) are compared element by element (unless you override this by providing a <code>key</code> argument). Since each element of a string is a character, a string is compared character by character, and they are compared by their code point value.</span>
