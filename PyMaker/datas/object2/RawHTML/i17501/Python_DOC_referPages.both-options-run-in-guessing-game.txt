<p>So I'm very new to programing and I'm using Python (v3.33) to create little programs like so:</p>
<pre><code>option = input('What Game Would You Like To Play? A, B, C, or D? ')
option == 'A'
guess = int(input('Guess a number: '))
while True:
    while guess != 100:
        if guess &gt; 100:
            print('Too High... Try Again')
        if guess &lt; 100:
            print('Too Low... Try Again')
        guess = int(input('Guess a number: '))
    if guess == 100:
        print('You Win')
        break

option == 'B'
guess = int(input('Guess a number: '))
while True:
    while guess != 50:
        if guess &gt; 50:
            print('Too High...Try Again')
        if guess &lt; 50:
            print('Too Low... Try Again')
            guess = int(input('Guess a number: '))
    if guess == 50:
        print('You Win')
        break
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my problem- I want the user to be able to select 'A' or 'B' (I will get to adding 'C' and 'D' but want to fix problems first) but the program takes the user through 'A' automatically and then to 'B': How do I get it so user can select 'A' and 'B'. 
Also, how do I make it so user can have option to say 'Yes' or 'No' if they want to run it again.
Thanks</p>

<p>wrap the whole thing in a while loop:</p>
<pre><code>while True:

    option = input('What Game Would You Like To Play? A, B, C, or D (Q to quit)? ').upper() # this can accept both lower and upper case input

    if option == 'Q': 
        break

    elif option == 'A': 
        Do some code 

    elif option == 'B':
        Do some code

    elif option == 'C':
        Do some code

    elif option == 'D':
        Do some code

    else:
        print ("You didn't enter a valid choice!")
</code></pre>
<p><strong>About your code:</strong></p>
<pre><code>option == 'A'
</code></pre>
<p>that line simply tests whether option is equal to 'A'. It returns a <code>True</code> or a <code>False</code>.
You want to test for options actual value. Hence the <code>if</code> statements above.</p>
<p>Your code is just running through all scenarios because you haven't provided the conditions under which things should happen. Only when <code>option == 'A'</code> should code for that situation be run. Only when <code>option == 'D'</code> should code for that be run. And only when <code>option == 'Q'</code> should the main loop break. This is a good example of when to use the <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>With regards to your comment, you could do the following:</p>
<pre><code>option = input('What Game Would You Like To Play? A, B, C, or D (Q to quit)? ')
if option == 'a': # upper is gone, you can specify upper or lower case 'manually'
    do this
if option == 'A':
    do this
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Or</strong> </p>
<pre><code>if option in ['a', 'A']: # this basically same effect as my original answer
       do something
</code></pre>
<p>check out how the <code>str.upper()</code> method works <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_upper.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It takes you through both options because you are not using a check for the option.</p>
<p>While your code is <em>technically</em> checking <code>option == 'A'</code> and then later <code>option == 'B'</code>, it's not checking one or the other and not doing anything with that check.</p>
<p>Instead you would want:</p>
<pre><code>option = input('What Game Would You Like To Play? A, B, C, or D? ')

if option == 'A':
    guess = int(input('Guess a number: '))
    ....
    break
elif option == 'B':
    guess = int(input('Guess a number: '))
    ....
    break
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>elif</code> is there instead of <code>else</code> so you have room to add code for options C and D.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you want more people to help, change your question title to something related to the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if option == 'A': may be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes that was it- thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Further down the line, you can also add in some logic for how you'd handle cases where the user entered something you didn't anticipate...like if they entered "z" for yes/no =b</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you.  Quickly what does '.upper()' mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It means that even if someone enters a lowercase letter, it is converted to the upper case for the check. So if they enter 'b' or 'q'. It becomes 'B' or 'Q'.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3291108, try to get used to sites like <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/search.html?q=upper&amp;check_keywords=yes&amp;area=default" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/â€¦</a>, they will help now and then.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay- I will do that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3291108 in the python interpreter type 'a'.upper() and hit enter, and try 'B'.lower() and hit enter. It will show you the result</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your help</span>
