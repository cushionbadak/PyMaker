<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Can I use print elements in a for loop with some conditions ?<br/>
Actually I have this block of code : </p>
<pre><code>sum = 0
for i in range(1,1000):
    if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0 :
        sum+=i
print(sum)  
</code></pre>
<p>and I want to convert it in a single line of code.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>You can use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator-expressions">generator expression</a>:</p>
<pre><code>print(sum(i for i in range(1,1000) if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0))
</code></pre>
<p>Note that I'm using the built-in function <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum"><code>sum()</code></a> here, which is different than you variable <code>sum</code> (in general you shouldn't use that as a name since it shadows the built-in function).</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using reduce and lambda:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; reduce( lambda x,y: x +y, [i for i in range(1000) if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0 ])
233168 
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Or If you  want variable condition:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def sum_it(Range, Divisible_by):
...    return sum([[0, i][any([i % n == 0 for n in Divisible_by])] for i in range(Range)])
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum_it(1000, [3,5])
233168
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum_it(1000, [3,6])

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you want to convert it to a single line of code? Readability is very important, and condensing code into one line makes things less readable, and harder to debug.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want browse integers from 1 to 1000 and add only the ones that are multiples of 3 or 5 to my sum</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BryanOakley I just want to have an example :) Thanks for pieces of advice :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, by making use of <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehensions</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">next time please don't choose answer too soon, it keep away from more answer :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you @arshajii, so it's not possible to do it with my variable sum by incrementing it with i value each time it satisfies my conditions ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mounaim If you want to use that type of approach, then you shouldn't really use a generator. Incrementing a variable according to some condition is better done by a simple for-loop as you have. Just be sure to rename the <code>sum</code> variable to something else (perhaps <code>total</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok arshajii tanks for help :) :)</span>
