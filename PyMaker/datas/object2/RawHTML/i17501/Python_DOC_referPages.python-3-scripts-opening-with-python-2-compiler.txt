<p>All of the scripts that I save in the C:\Python33 folder are opening with my other installation of Python 2.7.</p>
<p>Is there a quick fix for this?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>if you mean that the script run with python2.7 in command line, then you need to change <code>PATH</code> environment variable. so it include python3.3 folder and not python2.7 folder.</p>
<p>look at: <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/284342/what-are-path-and-other-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-set-or-use-them" title="how to change PATH variale">how to change PATH variable</a></p>
<p>if you speak about double-click openning in windows, then you need to change the default "open-with" program. you can see how to do it here: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-default-programs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-default-programs</a></p>
<p>if you speak about IDLE editor, note that you have two IDELS, one for each python version.
(you can see which version it is in the start-up text. for example:</p>
<pre><code>Python 2.7.5 (default, May 15 2013, 22:43:36) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
</code></pre>
<p>but, If I understand you last comment right, what you looking for is exactly the answer that was answered here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15343138/using-edit-with-idle-with-a-python-2-6-5-script">Using "Edit with IDLE" with a Python 2.6.5 script</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Add the line:</p>
<pre><code>#! python3
</code></pre>
<p>at the start of your scripts. See the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher" rel="nofollow">Windows launcher documentation</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Well the program runs with python 2.7 when you click F5 or click run in the editor. It works fine in the command line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">which editor? it maybe in the editor configuration.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The IDLE editor</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3129956 next time, try to be more specific in your question...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry about that. What I meant was that the open with is set to python 2.7. I am not able to change this even when I go through the dialog. The default compiler remains as python 2.7 even when I try to change it. The solution from that other question helped</span>
