<p>I don't know what changed, but suddenly none of my Python App Engine projects will start on my PC. They start on my MacBook just fine, so there's something about the installation on my PC that's messed up. I've tried going back to 1.8.8, but that doesn't work. I've also tried using a fresh Python installation, but that didn't work. I've even tried using port 8080 (I usually use port 80, as I run the app launcher as admin).</p>
<p>This is what shows up in the error log when I click start on one of my projects:</p>

<p>Also, I'm using Windows 7 x64. My original installation of Python is from Enthought x64, but I did try using the basic x64 Python as well. As mentioned, I downgraded from 1.8.9 to 1.8.8, to no avail.</p>

<p>From a quick Google search, other users are <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pylons-discuss/FpOSMDpdvy4" rel="nofollow">suggesting it's a bug in pyvenv</a>. Since not very many people are still using CherryPy, and it seems to only manifest itself in whatever CherryPy is doing there, that's probably it.</p>
<p>Bug the gist is that somewhere, only on Windows, you have a pydoc.py file which is being imported instead of the standard library's pydoc file.</p>
<p>So, find the offending pydoc.py file in your import path, and rename it. You can most likely find it by doing something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import pydoc
print pydoc.__file__
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">should it be pythonw?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As far as I know it's always used pythonw. I tried specifying python.exe — no dice, same error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you mean a bug in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pyvenv</a>, not <a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pyenv</a>.  (pyenv hasn’t been ported to Windows and its author says it <a href="https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/issues/62" rel="nofollow noreferrer">never will be</a>).</span>
