<p>I am new to python. </p>
<p>I wanted to know if I could create a text file in the script itself before writing into.
I do not want to create a text file using the command prompt.</p>
<p>I have written this script to write the result into the file</p>
<pre><code>with open('1.txt', 'r') as flp:
        data = flp.readlines()
</code></pre>
<p>however I know that 1.txt has to be created before writing into it.</p>
<p>Any help would be highly appreciated.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow">Open can be used in a several modes</a>, in your case you have opened in read mode ('r'). To write to a file you use the write mode ('w').  </p>
<p>So you can get a file object with:</p>
<pre><code>open('1.txt', 'w')
</code></pre>
<p>If 1.txt doesn't exist it will create it. If it does exist it will truncate it. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <strong>open()</strong> to create files. 
Example:</p>
<pre><code>open("log.txt", "a")
</code></pre>
<p>This will create the file if it doesn't exist yet, and will append to it if the file already exists.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using open(filename, 'w') creates the file if it's not there. Be careful though, if the file exists it will be overritten!</p>
