<p>Is it possible to connect the Python compiler to a single button called run? Using PQT4 for Python 3, I have a run button, and a text editor, when the user clicks run I would like all the code in the text editor to be checked and complied. Is this possible? Are there any code examples for something like this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Have you tried to run the code in an interactive interpreter instance? <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/code.html#interactive-console-objects" rel="nofollow">Interactive Console Objects</a></p>
<p><strong>Explanation of Interactive console objects</strong></p>
<p>When you import the class and create a new instance you could then run code without interrupting the main python thread.</p>
<pre><code>from code import InteractiveInterpreter

code1 = """
def foo():
    print notDefined

foo()
"""

code2 = """
def baz(spam):
    print spam

baz('eggs')
"""

interpreter = InteractiveInterpreter()
interpreter.runcode(code1)
interpreter.runcode(code2)
</code></pre>
<p>outputs : </p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 3, in foo
NameError: global name 'notDefined' is not defined
eggs
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">No, how is this done?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you send all the code to the instance and it can give you the results or throw an exception if the code has something wrong</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there sample code for this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">one second, i will edit the answer to show you a sample</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thats brilliant, how do i do it so it reads from the text file?</span>
