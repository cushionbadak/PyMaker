<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So right now I have this (in Python 2.7):</p>
<pre><code>if y == ports[0]:
   Array1.append(x)
 elif y == ports[1]:
   Array2.append(x)
 elif y == ports[2]:
   Array3.append(x)
 elif y == ports[3]:
   Array4.append(x)
 else:
   Array5.append(x)

for x in Array1:
    target=open('Array1.csv', 'a')
    target.write(x + ",\n")
    target.close()
    print "Added IP address " + x + " to Array1.csv\n"

for x in Array2:
 target=open('Array2.csv', 'a')
 target.write(x + ",\n")
 target.close()
 print "Added IP address " + x + " to Array2.csv\n"

for x in Array3:
 target=open('Array3.csv', 'a')
 target.write(x + ",\n")
 target.close()
 print "Added IP address " + x + " to Array3.csv\n"

for x in Array4:
  target=open('Array4.csv', 'a')
  target.write(x + ",\n")
  target.close()
  print "Added IP address " + x + " to Array4.csv\n"

  target=open('Array5.csv', 'a')
  target.write(x + ",\n")
  target.close()
  print "Added IP address " + x + " to Array5.csv\n"
</code></pre>
<p>Would the program finish quicker if I did:</p>
<pre><code>if y == ports[0]:
    Array1.append(x)
    target=open('Array1.csv', 'a')
    target.write(x + ",\n")
    target.close()
    print "Added IP address " + x + " to Array1.csv\n"
elif y == ports[1]:
    Array2.append(x)
    target=open('Array2.csv', 'a')
    target.write(x + ",\n")
    target.close()
    print "Added IP address " + x + " to Array2.csv\n"
elif y == ports[2]:
    Array3.append(x)
    target=open('Array3.csv', 'a')
    target.write(x + ",\n")
    target.close()
    print "Added IP address " + x + " to Array3.csv\n"
elif y == ports[3]:
    Array4.append(x)
    target=open('Array4.csv', 'a')
    target.write(x + ",\n")
    target.close()
    print "Added IP address " + x + " to Array4.csv\n"
else:
    Array5.append(x)
    target=open('Array5.csv', 'a')
    target.write(x + ",\n")
    target.close()
    print "Added IP address " + x + " to Array5.csv\n"
</code></pre>
<p>Or would I see any difference at all? Or perhaps there is a third way that is quicker? Does it matter when the item is written to the list? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That probably barely matters. What’s more important is not constantly reopening the file:</p>
<pre><code>with open('Array1.csv', 'a') as target:
    for x in Array1:
        target.write(x + ",\n")
        print "Added IP address " + x + " to Array1.csv\n"
</code></pre>
<p>Also, I don’t know if it applies here, but <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">the <code>csv</code> module</a> <em>does</em> exist.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Why don't you just measure it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In either case, I have a suggestion. Instead of having five variables <code>Array1</code> through <code>Array5</code>, have one list <code>Arrays</code>, which contains five arrays. Then your first code could be, <code>for i in range(5): for x in Array[i]:</code> instead of five loops in a row.</span>
