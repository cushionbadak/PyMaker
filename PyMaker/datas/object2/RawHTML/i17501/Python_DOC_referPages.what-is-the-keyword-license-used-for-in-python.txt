A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related

<span class="comment-copy">It is not a keyword, but a builtin function; you could have just run the shell and type it to figure it out :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, <code>license()</code> and <code>quit()</code> etc.. works perfectly in non interactive mode, as functions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GuillaumeLebreton: sure, but they are rarely <i>useful</i> outside of the interpreter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not even really a builtin, it only exists at the interactive interpreter and is defined in <code>site.py</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Interesting, that's not what the distributed 2.7.3 source would print.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@delnan: it's set on the <code>__builtin__</code> module by <code>site.py</code>..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters Any code can put anything into <code>__builtin__</code>, I use "builtin" in the sense of <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html</a> and the like. Stuff from the interpreter core.</span>
