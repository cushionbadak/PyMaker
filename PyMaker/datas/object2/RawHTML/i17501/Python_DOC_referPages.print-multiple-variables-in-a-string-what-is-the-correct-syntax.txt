<p>I am just getting started with python. I have experience with some other languages I was just curious what the correct syntax would be to print the output of multiple variables in a string. or even the same variable multiple times in a string.</p>
<pre><code>arg1 = 1

arg2 = 2

print ("arg1 =",arg1) # &lt;---------------------------this works 

arg1 = 1

print ("arg1 =",arg1 "arg2",arg2) # &lt;----------------why not this ?
</code></pre>

<p>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</p>

<p>The second argument would be <code>arg1 "arg2"</code> which is not a valid expression. If you want to print both <code>arg1</code> and <code>"arg2"</code>, you should separate it by another comma:</p>
<pre><code>print("arg1 =", arg1, "arg2 =", arg2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As @Wooble points out, you have a syntax error. But let's clarify how this works in Python.</p>
<pre><code>print(a, b, c, d,....)
</code></pre>
<p>is basically the same as</p>
<pre><code>output = " ".join(a, b, c, d)
print(output)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to output the same variable multiple times, sometimes <code>format</code> is better. <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">You're missing a comma. <code>arg1 "arg2"</code> isn't a valid expression.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I meant to put "arg2 =",arg2    so i was expecting to see the print output say arg1 =1 agr2=2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the comment. One thing i should have mentioned is I also want these two variables to show up in the same string. not sure the best way to do this.  Basically what i want to do is print multiple variables in one print statement. I understand how to do this when I want to print a single variable but how to do this when in the print statement i want to print the output of two or more variables.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matt If you try that print call from my answer, you will see that the text is automatically combined, so for <code>arg = 1</code> and <code>arg2 = 2</code>, the output would be <code>arg 1 = 1 arg2 = 2</code>â€”in a single line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok I see I think I just needed to add the comma before and after the variable in arg1. I tried your output and your correct. Thanks so much I appreciate your help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">print("arg1 =", arg1, "arg2 =", arg2) #;this is what i wanted thanks arg1 = 1 arg2 = 2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I understand how achieve this when there is no text in the print statement. but how to achieve this when you want to combine literal text and print the output of a variable in the same print statement.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matt he told you how to do that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is no difference from a literal string and a variable containing a string. You just add what you want output and use commas to separate them. Personally, I prefer and use <code>format</code> for anything one than simple <code>print(a)</code> or <code>print("this is a:", a)</code>.</span>
