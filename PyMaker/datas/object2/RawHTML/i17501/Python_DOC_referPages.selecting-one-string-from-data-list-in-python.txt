<p>I am relatively new to programming, so be easy on me.  </p>
<p>I have made a program (much like a magic 8 ball) that the user asks a question, and then I have created a list with all my answers inside of it (14 answers). My program shuffles all the answers, but then I now need to assign every piece of data (using a random number generator from 1-14 (which I've completed), and then have it match the shuffled data with a random number and print that.  </p>
<p>I have created the random number generator, and the answer list shuffles.  I just need to know how to assign the number to the strings in my list, and then print that one string.  </p>

<p>Lists have indices; if your number is between 0 and 13 (inclusive), then you can just use that directly on your list:</p>
<pre><code>print(answers[random_number])
</code></pre>
<p>However, the <code>random</code> module has a dedicated function for just this use case; <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow"><code>random.choice()</code></a> picks one value from a sequence at random:</p>
<pre><code>print(random.choice(answers))
</code></pre>
<p>No need to shuffle anything that way..</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; answers = ['Without a doubt!', 'Hmmm, not so sure', 'By the winds, set sail now!', 'Oh no, no NO NO!!']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(random.choice(answers))
Hmmm, not so sure
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(random.choice(answers))
Oh no, no NO NO!!
</code></pre>
