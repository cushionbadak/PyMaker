<p>I would like to mimic python documentations fronpage for my own project. Trouble is every other page has show source link in the sidebar except for the front page.</p>
<p>How can I archive the same effect on new sphinx project?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The documentation front page at <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://docs.python.org/3/</a> is based on <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jinja</a> templates.</p>
<ul>
<li>The top-level template is <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Doc/tools/templates/layout.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">layout.html</a>, which extends a <a href="https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/master/sphinx/themes/basic/layout.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sphinx template</a> with the same name.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Doc/tools/templates/indexcontent.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">indexcontent.html</a> provides the structure for the main content. </li>
<li>The sidebar has its own special template: <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Doc/tools/templates/indexsidebar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">indexsidebar.html</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The theme is called <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Doc/tools/pydoctheme" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pydoctheme</a> (<code>html_theme = 'pydoctheme'</code> in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Doc/conf.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">conf.py</a>).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If all else fails, check out the repository.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've tried looking at the doc directory of pythons source code but all I could find was contents.rst that included standard toctree. I haven't found how does it make it look like it does. My toctree's just output a standard list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're probably after their theme then, because the theme does things like formatting the index page.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When then the question can be slightly altered to how can I alter my current theme (<a href="https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme</a>) to have this kind of layout.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The default theme for sphinx is the theme for python 2.7 documentation but it still doesn't format my toctree the same as their site. Something funky going on over here.</span>
