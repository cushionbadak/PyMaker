<p>I have the following equation: </p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

d = (x - y) / np.log((x - z) / (y - z))
</code></pre>
<p>Where I am trying to find <code>x</code></p>
<p>Is this possible in <code>numpy</code> or other python libraries? In this case, could you please provide sample code of how to do it with this specific problem?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would probably use just <code>sympy</code> and their solver:
<a href="https://docs.sympy.org/0.7.1/modules/solvers/solvers.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sympy Library Solver</a></p>
<pre><code>from sympy import solve, log, exp
from sympy.abc import x,y,z,d

f = (x - y) / log((x - z) / (y - z)) - d

solution = solve(f, x)
</code></pre>
<p>And the output is giving me is </p>
<pre><code>[-d*LambertW(-(y - z)*exp(-(y - z)/d)/d) + z]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">So what you want is to have x(d,y,z) ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need to rewrite the equation with x = etc...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use <code>sympy</code> to find $x(d,y,z)$ and then calculate it using <code>numpy</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When i try to paste x(d,y,z)$ in the terminal (even after setting dummy variables x = 50, y = 40, z = 30) I get "invalid syntax" error after running the code. sympy was imported as well</span>
<span class="comment-copy">fantastic! works. thanks for introducing me to this library!</span>
