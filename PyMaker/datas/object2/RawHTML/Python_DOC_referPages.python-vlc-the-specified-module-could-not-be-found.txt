<p>I have been experimenting with a midi controller and i am currently trying to program a button that's playing a randomly chosen video from a folder with vlc in fullscreen. 
However, after I installed the vlc module (pip install python-vlc), everytime I start my program the same error comes:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "XTouch.py", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    import vlc

File "C:\Users\edoua\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\vlc.py", line 207, in &lt;module&gt;
    dll, plugin_path  = find_lib()

    self._handle = _dlopen(self._name, mode)

<p>I have been searching and testing for hours and I got no idea what is going wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your help!</p>

<p>It looks like your binding can't seem to load the libvlc libraries. Make sure it's properly installed on your system and the path is correct. Share more code otherwise.</p>
