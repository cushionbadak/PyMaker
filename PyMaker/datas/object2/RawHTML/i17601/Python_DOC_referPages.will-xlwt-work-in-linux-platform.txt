<p>I am working on a project which is based on python windows version. Now the customer wants the project to be extended to linux platform also.</p>
<p>My project uses the package xlwt, xlrd for writing the results to the excel sheet.</p>
<p>So here, Will these packages are compatible with the linux platform also? </p>
<p>Can I use this package in Linux? Or Is there any equivalent package for Linux to write the result to a spreadsheet?</p>
<p>Since my code is very huge,Is there any tool to convert the whole code from windows platform to linux platform? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, xlrd/xlwt work fine on Linux. Most python code and libraries run the same on any platform.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Unless these packages don't use Excel API directly they should work. Please consult documentation of these packages for any issues.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the answer.I have one more query. My project includes a windows based pyd. Can I use that pyd in the linux platform. If not how should I proceed further?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">pyd files are Windows DLLs, not python code, so won't work on Linux.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok.. So how can I create dll's for linux?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On Linux, they're not DLLs. You should start by reading <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/extending/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/extending</a> if you're using Python 3, or <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/extending/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/extending</a> if you're using Python 2. This will be a question of recompiling (and probably porting) the C or C++ code for the DLL to Linux.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot.. Your links helped me a lot...</span>
