<p>I have a string, created from a list. When I try to send the string as the body of an email, I get this error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\u2013' in position 1242: ordinal not in range(128)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the "en" character, or dash, taken from a web page.</p>
<p>So I tried to use this code to fix the issue:</p>
<pre><code>    message = str(all_items)
    message.replace('\u2013','-')
</code></pre>
<p>Problem is, that does not work. Please can you tell me what I am doing wrong here? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Did you mean to replace string inplace?</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" rel="nofollow"><code>str.replace</code></a> does not change the string inplace, but returns the replaced string.</p>
<p>You need to assign the result of <code>str.replace</code> back:</p>
<pre><code>message = message.replace('\u2013', '-')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">We don't know. You forgot to show the code you're using to compose the email.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show how does the string is being created?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The string is a dictionary of extracts from a web page.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Aaaand ... I'm an idiot. Thanks, that did it.</span>
