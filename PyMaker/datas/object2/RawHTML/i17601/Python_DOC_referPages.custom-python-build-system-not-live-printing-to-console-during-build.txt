<p>I recently switched python distributions to <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/" rel="nofollow">Anaconda from Continuum Analytics</a>. After installing Python 3.3, I created a build system for use with Sublime (3):</p>
<pre><code>{
    "cmd": ["python.exe", "$file"],
    "path": "D:/Users/bsouthga/AppData/Local/Continuum/Anaconda/envs/py33/",
    "file_regex": "^[ ]*File \"(...*?)\", line ([0-9]*)",
    "selector": "source.py",
}
</code></pre>
<p>It runs scripts fine, except for the fact that output is only printed upon completion of the build. How can I enable normal (live) printing?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's possible that you need to run the script in "unbuffered" mode via the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-u" rel="nofollow"><code>-u</code></a> flag. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Force the binary layer of the stdout and stderr streams (which is
  available as their buffer attribute) to be unbuffered. The text I/O
  layer will still be line-buffered if writing to the console, or
  block-buffered if redirected to a non-interactive file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This solution isn't specific to Anaconda, but may still be the issue.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yep! Seems to have done the trick</span>
