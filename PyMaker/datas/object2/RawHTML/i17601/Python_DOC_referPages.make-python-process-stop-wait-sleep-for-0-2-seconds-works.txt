<p>Title says it all, is it possible to make python sleep for less than a second?
WORKS:</p>
<pre><code>import time
print ("foo")
time.sleep(0.2) #talking about the value of the time
print ("bar")
</code></pre>
<p>If not, then is there any other way?
Thanks
Using python 3.2.2
EDIT: Thanks guys, I'm pretty sure I have tried the above code before and it didn't work. Oh well... sorry for your waste if time. It worked now and I upgraded to 3.3</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Based on the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep" rel="nofollow"><code>time.sleep()</code></a> documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The actual suspension time <strong>may be less than</strong> that requested because any caught signal will terminate the sleep() following execution of that signalâ€™s catching routine. Also, the suspension time <strong>may be longer than</strong> requested by an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of other activity in the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it works but there are no guarantees.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried this? This is very valid code. And for the love of all that is computable, please switch to python3.3, which is the stable 3.x release</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you actually try this? Your code already works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you read the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time.sleep()</code> documantion</a>? If so, what wasn't clear or match your requirements?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is a little complicated: so what you need to do is select the code you put in your question, copy it, paste it into your interactive session or .py file, and run it. voila!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@inspectorG4dget: The OP may be on a Ubuntu or Debian release which still provides 3.2. It doesn't really matter here.</span>
