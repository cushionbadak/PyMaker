<p>So I have been searching and searching all day, but I cannot seem to find how to create my dictionary I created in Python and create something similar in Java. I have tried looking at ArrayList and List etc. But to no avail.</p>
<pre><code>PIECESDICT = {1: [[0,0], [0,1], [0,2], [1,1]], 2: [[0,0], [1,0], [0,1]], 3: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,1]], 4: [[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]], 5: [[0,0], [1,0], [2,0]]} 
</code></pre>
<p>So here is my Dictionary, and essentially what it does is just says from coords (0,0) being the top left point of each piece. It is a piece in and of itself.</p>
<p>For example Piece 1 would look like:</p>
<pre><code>0
00
0
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly Piece 2 would look like:</p>
<pre><code>00
0
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could try a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" rel="nofollow"><code>HashMap</code></a></p>
<p>The way you could use it:</p>
<pre><code>Map&lt;Integer, Integer[][]&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;Integer, Integer[][]&gt;();
Integer[][] v1 = { { 0, 0 }, { 0, 1 }, { 0, 2 }, { 1, 1 } };
map.put(1, v1);
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It looks like you want... a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" rel="nofollow"><code>HashMap</code></a> of <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ArrayList</code>s</a> of some kind of pair or coordinate object.</p>
<p>If you have a <code>Pair</code> class that accepts the coordinates as arguments (e.g. <code>new Pair(0, 0)</code>), then you can just do something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>HashMap&lt;Integer, ArrayList&lt;Pair&gt;&gt; map = new HashMap&lt;Integer, ArrayList&lt;Pair&gt;&gt;();

ArrayList&lt;Pair&gt; first = new ArrayList&lt;Pair&gt;();
first.add(new Pair(1, 2));
first.add(new Pair(3, 4));

map.put(1, first);

// map == {1: [[1,2], [3,4]]}
</code></pre>
<p><code>HashMap</code> can also accept a <code>String</code> (instead of <code>Integer</code>) as a key for the lists within.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>what about HashMap?
for example:
map.put("name", "value");</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you need to move data from Python to Java, check out JSON.</p>
<p>In Python, you could use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html</a></p>
<p>And for Java: <a href="http://json.org/java/" rel="nofollow">http://json.org/java/</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">You could try a HashMap.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you explain to me how to use that similar to a dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you've been searching all day, you should work on your search terms. The first google hit for <code>Java dictionary</code> is the (admittedly obsolete) <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Dictionary.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dictionary class</a>, and reading the class description would have pointed you towards <code>Map</code>. Searching <code>Java map</code> yields <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/map.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this tutorial</a> as the second hit, which is an extensive introduction to the topic. But actually, if all your keys are numbers from 1 upwards like in your example, you could just use a list...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or just <code>Map&lt;Integer, int[][]&gt;</code>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you that makes perfect sense! I don't know why I didn't look into something like that earlier. I was originally looking more so into an ArrayList of an ArrayList of an ArrayList, so thanks to everyone who helped.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes a Hashmap will work, I do like the idea, but then how do I include the <code>[[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[1,1]]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can choose what the Object in the value will be.. you can decide that it will array of Point (which you should define)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How does JSON help here? The OP wanted to implement a data structure in Java and gave a Python structure as an example of what was needed. Where does it talk about moving data?</span>
