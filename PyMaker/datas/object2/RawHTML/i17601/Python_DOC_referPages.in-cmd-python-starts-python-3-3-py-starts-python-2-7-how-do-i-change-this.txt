<p>Brand new Python, just getting things set up and installed before I start messing around with things. My understanding is that there are some notable differences/incompatibilities between Python 2.7 and Python 3.3, though both versions are well used, so I thought it best to install <em>both</em> (In their own install directories).</p>
<p>When installing, I used the new 3.3 feature where the installer set the PATH variables for me, however this option is not present for 2.7. After installing both versions, I tried a quick test, opened command prompt, and typed <code>python</code> to bring up an interactive session, and as I hoped, it brought up python 3.3. </p>
<p>I am also aware of the shorter <code>py</code> command. However when I try <code>py</code> in command prompt, it brings up python 2.7. I can use <code>py -3</code> to bring up 3.3, but that makes it longer than it needs to be, and seeing as I will be dealing primarily with version 3.3, I would like <code>py</code> <em>and</em> <code>python</code> to both bring up a Python 3.3 interactive session.</p>
<p>I am somewhat familiar with Window's PATH system, but I can't see why this is happening. How can I set it up so that <em>both</em> <code>py</code> and <code>python</code>, when typed into a windows command prompt, will start a Python 3.3 interactive session unless otherwise specified, e.g. via something like <code>py -2</code>?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><code>py</code> is the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Windows Python launcher</a>, and it can start <em>any</em> Python version.</p>
<p>On most systems <code>py</code> is configured to launch Python 2.7 by default if present (this is the default except for Python 3.6 and newer, where Python 3 will be run instead). You have two options if you want to change that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Set an <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/284342/what-are-path-and-other-environment-variables-and-how-can-i-set-or-use-them">environment variable</a>; <code>PY_PYTHON=3</code> will make <code>py</code> run the latest Python 3 interpreter instead. </p></li>
<li><p>Create a file <code>py.ini</code> in your application directory with the contents:</p>
<pre><code>[defaults]
python=3
</code></pre>
<p>This has the same effect as the <code>PY_PYTHON</code> environment variable. Typically, your application directory is found in <code>C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data</code> or <code>C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\py.ini</code>, depending on the Windows version.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You can also add a <code>#!</code> shebang line to your scripts (first line) to tell the launcher to use Python 3 when you doubleclick such a file:</p>
<pre><code>#! python3
</code></pre>
<p><code>py</code> can also be configured to use specific Python versions when you have multiple Python 3 interpreters installed. </p>

<p>"py" is the python launcher, you could choose which version to launch by adding params <code>-2</code> or <code>-3</code>, see the help notes below:</p>

Python Launcher for Windows Version 3.3.2150.1013

usage: py [ launcher-arguments ] script [ script-arguments ]

-2     : Launch the latest Python 2.x version
-3     : Launch the latest Python 3.x version
-X.Y   : Launch the specified Python version

<p>e.g., on my machine, <code>py</code> starts python 2 by default, adding <code>-3</code> makes it start python 3:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Trivia: By default—if it is not overwritten with the environment variable, the ini file or with the parameter—the Python launcher will always prefer Python 2 over Python 3 installations (if both are available). This is the case because in the source, the check for version 2 simply <a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/c3896275c0f6/PC/launcher.c#l445" rel="nofollow noreferrer">comes first</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That did the trick, thanks. I used the first option, as it seemed 'cleaner'.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the first line <code>#! python3</code> does not work with me, why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zhangxaochen this works for me on Win7: <code>#! /usr/bin/python3</code></span>

<span class="comment-copy">What if I want to use <code>python</code> instead of <code>py</code> my vscode extensions keep trying to use <code>python</code> and it returns not found</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did not know this +1 mate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I understand how I can chose the version with arguments, but currently <code>py</code> with no arguments defaults to version 2.7, just like yours, whereas I would like it to default to version 3.3, as I will use 3.3 the most, and <code>py</code> is ever so slightly shorter than <code>py -3</code>. Is this possible?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2649607, I'd like make it a batch file or shortcut link, and then pin it to the task bar or start menu. Moreover, I'd like to bind the launch of the program to some hotkey using <code>autohotkey</code>, so that I could launch it just by pressing <code>ctrl+shift+p</code> (or whatever you like)</span>
