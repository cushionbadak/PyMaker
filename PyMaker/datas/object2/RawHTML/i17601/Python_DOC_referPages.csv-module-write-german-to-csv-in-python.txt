<p>I'm reading german names from a csv, and want to write them in a csv file, with the right encoding for ä, ö and ü. Reading works fine, but when I write to the csv, the characters are displayed like this: LÃ¶ffler.</p>
<pre><code>reader1 = csv.reader(open('names.csv', 'rb'), delimiter=',')
</code></pre>
<p>What do I need to add to my writer to get the right encoding?</p>
<pre><code>    outfile.write('K:' + n + ',' + a + ',' + '-' + '\n')
</code></pre>
<p>I tried unicodecsv, but can't get it to work:</p>
<pre><code>w = unicodecsv.writer(outfile, encoding='utf-8')
w.write('K:' + n + ',' + a + ',' + '-' + '\n')
</code></pre>
<p>Error message:</p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: 'UnicodeWriter' object has no attribute 'write'
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>python2.X</code> your best bet is using tool like <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicodecsv/" rel="nofollow">unicodecsv</a>, as <code>csv</code> module in this python handles only <code>acsii</code>. </p>
<p>On Python3+ you'll get this ot of the box, just pass proper encoding to the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow">open</a> function. </p>

<p>I think you must change the encoding of the file. I think UTF-8 should work.
Do you use Java?

<span class="comment-copy">what encoding does your file names.csv have?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please see my edited question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please look into csv module API, this module allows you to write rows of data (that is arrays) using <code>writer.writerow</code> function, while you are trying to write line by hand.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked, however, encoding still doesn't work! Can you point me to an easy example of how to use unicodecsv with csv writer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to use <code>unicodecsv</code> both to read and write the csv file. Encoding might get lost at any point.   Please post working example of your code, I might spot problems.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is for Java, isn't it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, you use Python, or?</span>
