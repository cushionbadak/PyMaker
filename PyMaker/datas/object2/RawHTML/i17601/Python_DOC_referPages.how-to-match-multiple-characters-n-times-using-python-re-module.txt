<p>I have a sequence: x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x<br/>
I want to match 'x-' n times following by x. The x is a number.<br/>
How can I do this?<br/>
I know that {n} matches the preceding RE n times but the following RE does not work:<br/></p>
<pre><code>pattern = \d-{n}\d
</code></pre>
<p>It is probably trying to match the - n times instead.<br/>
I am using python 3.3</p>
<p>[EDIT] One method is using a forloop to concat but I do not want to do this. Is there a more elegant way?</p>

<p>Right, because the preceding expression here is <code>-</code>.</p>
<p>If you want <code>\d-</code> to be the preceding expression, you have to make it a group. This is explained in the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#grouping" rel="nofollow">Regular Expression HOWTO</a>, and most other tutorials on regexps:</p>
<pre><code>pattern = r'(\d-){n}\d'
</code></pre>
<p>By default, groups are <em>capturing</em>â€”meaning each one can be referenced in a back reference. Which is usually fine, but if you want to reference <em>some</em> groups and not others, read about non-capturing groups a few sections down. Basically:</p>
<pre><code>pattern = r'(?:\d-){n}\d'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Put <code>\d-</code> in a non-capturing group:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(r'(?:\d-){5}\d', '1-2-3-4-5-6')
&lt;_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x0000000002BD0C60&gt;
