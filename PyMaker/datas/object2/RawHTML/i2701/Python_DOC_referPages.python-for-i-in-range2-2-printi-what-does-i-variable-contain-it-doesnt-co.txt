<p>I am trying to understand how this program works step by step</p>
<pre><code>for n in range(2, 10):
    for x in range(2, n):
        if n % x == 0:
            print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
            break
    else:
        # loop fell through without finding a factor
        print(n, 'is a prime number')

for i in range(2,2):
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>this code doesn't print anything so what's the actual value i contain, does it contains garbage value.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>range(2, 2)</code> is an empty sequence. Ranges are half-open, so <code>range(2, 2)</code> means "all integers <code>&gt;=2</code> but <code>&lt;2</code>", of which there are none:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; len(range(2, 2))
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(range(2, 2))
[]
</code></pre>
<p>So, when you iterate it, you get an empty iterator:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; it = iter(range(2, 2))
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(it)
StopIteration:
</code></pre>
<p>So, <code>for i in range(2, 2):</code> loops 0 times, never even getting as far as assigning anything to <code>i</code>, much less <code>print</code>ing it.</p>
<p>So <code>i</code> contains whatever it happened to contain before this <code>for</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 'this is a string'
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(2, 2): pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(i)
this is a string
</code></pre>
<p>… or, if it didn't contain anything, there is no <code>i</code> variable:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; del i
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(2, 2): pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(i)
NameError: name 'i' is not defined
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>for i in range(2,2)  result is empty list []</p>
<p>the code as following:</p>
<p>for n in range(2,11):
    for x in range(2,n):
        if n % x == 0:
            print(n,"prime")
            break
    else:
        print(n,"not a prime")</p>
<p>the result:
2 not a prime
3 not a prime
4 prime
5 not a prime
6 prime
7 not a prime
8 prime
9 prime
10 prime</p>

<span class="comment-copy">1) your indentation is off. please fix it; 2) try <code>print(list(range(2, 2))</code>. that might illuminate your issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also, you should add <code>print</code> statements immediately below your <code>for</code> loops. that'll help you figure this out too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This code seems to come from a section of the tutorial meant to illustrate how ’break’ and ’else’ operate in a for loop. For a newcomer that empty list is indeed a little distracting in that context and could have been made more explicit. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's no code that's building a list anywhere, so how does it result in an empty list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, what was the point of changing the OP's code to print <code>not a prime</code> for prime numbers and <code>prime</code> for composite numbers?</span>
