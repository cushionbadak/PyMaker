<p>I'm new to python language.
I want to save a line to a file and load a specific line of a file.
The problem is that I should read(load) a line of that file as object of another(Grade) class or save a line into file as object of another class(Grade)</p>
<p>I did it and I want to see if I did it in right!</p>
<pre><code>class Grade():

    def __init__(self,student_id=0,course_id=0,score=0):
        self._student_id = student_id
        self._course_id = course_id
        self._score = score

                #here I want to save the #object that passed as argument to a file is it right?

<p>In save function I checked if data is unique and I avoid using last \n in end of file</p>

<p>The model you're using of saving lines of class entries is inefficient. Instead, you can store your data in a better way. I am assuming each student id is unique and hashable (either a string or integer). So, you could simply have a dictionary that has all the information about each student: </p>
<pre><code>student_information = {
    {student_id}: {
        course_id: {course_id},
        score: {score}
    },
    ... # more students
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if you want to fetch a student's information, you could simply do <code>student_information[student_id]</code> to get the data you needed. For instance, you could do:</p>
<pre><code>grade = Grade(
    student_id, 
    student_information[student_id]["course_id"], 
    student_information[student_id]["score"]
)
</code></pre>
<p>You can easily set this dictionary as an instance variable of your <code>CourseUtil</code> class. </p>
<p>Now, @juanpa.arrivillaga mentioned that you should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pickle</code></a> to store that information (if you would like to go back to it later). Pickle allows you to store data like a dictionary into a files and load it. There is also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json</code></a> that can help you do the same thing. </p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Just use <code>pickle</code>, or at least let <code>json</code> do the heavy lifting, don't invent your own serialization routine.</span>
