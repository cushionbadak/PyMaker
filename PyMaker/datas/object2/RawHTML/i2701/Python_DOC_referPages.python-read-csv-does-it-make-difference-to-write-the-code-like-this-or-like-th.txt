<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>from csv import reader
nfl = list(reader(open("nfl.csv")))
</code></pre>
<p>or like this:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
f = open("my_data.csv")
csvreader = csv.reader(f)
my_data = list(csvreader)
</code></pre>
<p>Does it make much difference if I write a code in a first way? Is it as fast as the second one? How is it written in the real corporate life?</p>

<p>Neither method is ideal because you want to ensure the file is closed at the end. For this purpose you can use <code>with</code> to ensure the file is closed once you're finished processing it. This avoids mistakes where you might forget to call <code>.close()</code> on the file. More info on context managers can be found <a href="https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2016/03/07/python-with-context-managers/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. Examples of this can be seen in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#examples" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>So, something like:</p>
<pre><code>with open('my_data.csv') as infile:
    reader = csv.reader(infile)
    data = list(reader)
</code></pre>
<p>Note, however, this loads the whole contents of the file into memory. As the documentation examples show, you could instead iterate through the <code>reader</code> object if you don't need the whole file in memory.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It probably doesn't use either method, but the second is probably better. You should be using <code>with</code> context manager for handling files since that will ensure that the file gets closed at the end. Also, do you want all of the lines in a single list because it might be desirable to iterate through the reader line by line if you don't necessarily want all of the data?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#examples" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> gives examples of the correct way of reading CSV files</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AkshayNevrekar that's a particularly heavy dependency for reading CSV files if the OP doesn't already have <code>pandas</code> for some other purpose</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@roganjosh So, I can iterate if I don't want all the data? But what happens, if the file remains opened? Is there a risk that it might be accidentally edited by someone from aside? Or it just eats PC's memory?</span>
