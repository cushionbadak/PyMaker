<p>In C/C++, using the macro like below to comment huge blocks of code is common.</p>
<pre><code>#ifdef 0
//comment block code
#endif
</code></pre>
<p>Is there an equivalent way to comment off blocks of code in python?</p>

<p><strong>No.</strong> Python has no preprocessor, and its translation phases are different of those <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/translation_phases" rel="nofollow noreferrer">from C</a>. Please refer to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python's documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I recommend simply appending some <code>#-</code> string in front of every useless line (and also use some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" rel="nofollow noreferrer">version control</a> system like <a href="http://git-scm.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>git</code></a> to keep older versions; then you might not even need to comment out big code chunks, since they are kept by your version control system). </p>
<p>Good editors (like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">emacs</a>) have facilities (like its <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Rectangles.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rectangle</a> operations) to easily adding a string in front of many lines.</p>
<p>BTW, commenting out (or <code>#if 0</code>-ing it) a large piece of code is bad practice (even in C or C++), it makes your code unreadable. So <strong>don't do that!</strong></p>
<p>If you use <code>git</code>, adding a small comment like </p>
<pre><code># many obsolete functions like foo and bar 
# have been removed after commit 670aaf569a7cc104e
</code></pre>
<p>is IMHO much better than keeping and commenting out hundreds of useless source code lines, and that is why I think that commenting out many lines of code is almost always a mistake.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Even in C or C++ (they are <i>different</i> languages) commenting out a huge code chunk is bad taste and bad jhabit. Don't do that. You need to keep your code readable at all time!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Smells badly like some <a href="http://xyproblem.info" rel="nofollow noreferrer">XY problem</a>. As I explained in my answer, you should not comment huge blocks of code (even in C it is very bad practice).</span>
