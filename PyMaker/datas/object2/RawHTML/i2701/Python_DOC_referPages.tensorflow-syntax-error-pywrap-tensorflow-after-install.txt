<p>I've setup a virtualenv and using pip installed tensorflow via <code>sudo pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.10.0-py3-none-any.whl</code>. </p>
<p>However, when I open a python shell to test the install I get the following error:</p>

<p>I've searched around but can't find a straightforward solution to this. Any ideas? Thanks!</p>

<p><code>async</code> is a reserved keyword in Python 3 (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here's the full list</a>).</p>
<p>Look like you aren't the only one running into  this problem, there's an active thread on the <code>tensorflow</code> github issue tracker addressing it that dates back to July: <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/20517" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/20517</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Interesting, so should I try using a different version of tensorflow to get around this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's a PR in review right now. You'll have to either pull the code yourself or wait for a new release (hopefully soon? This is a pretty big issue). Here's the comment on the thread that addresses it: <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/20517#issuecomment-414037701" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright, I hope it gets resolved soon too. Thanks for the help</span>
