<p>I am just trying to read a .csv file which I saved in a directory. 
At first I give </p>
<pre><code>path="E:\\Google\\Google Stock Market Data - google_stock_data.csv"
</code></pre>
<p>It is interpreted successfully. I move to next line. And give the command </p>
<pre><code>file=open(path)
</code></pre>
<p>Then it gives the error.</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#1&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    file=open(path)
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'E:\\Google\\Google Stock Market Data - google_stock_data.csv'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When I downloaded it "as csv", it turned out it was downloaded as <code>.csv.csv</code>. Maybe that's the problem?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Have you tried to move the file to your root project folder and call it by its name only? 
Using this way you can start checking if the file is reachable.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Once you solved the problem and asked for a code to read the CSV, here it is!</p>
<pre><code>import csv

stock = []

with open('google_stock_data.csv') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
    for row in reader:
        stock.append({
            'date': row[0],
            'open': row[1],
            'high': row[2],
            'low': row[3],
            'close': row[4],
            'volume': row[5],
            'adj_close': row[6]
        })
print(stock)

<span class="comment-copy">Try using raw string Ex: <code>path=r"E:\Google\Google Stock Market Data - google_stock_data.csv"</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alternatively, try using single forward slashes, and double check the path is correct</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rakesh OP is using double slashes (that escape the potential control character <code>'\G'</code>). Using raw string will have the exact same behavior.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, does the file actually exist in this path?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace..the question was updated...before OP was using single slashes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is working when I have tried to move the file in root project folder.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's working fine now. How can I create a dictionary in python from the .csv file ?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">What access link? OP is trying to open a file on their local machine.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">How will <code>csv</code> help to find a missing file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The above method is also giving the following error.
