<p>Running Python 3.6.5</p>
<p>I'm very new to python. When I run these lines separately in the terminal, I get exactly what I want. When I run the python file, the input prompt 'ideal weight?' won't end after I submit a number. It keeps repeating 'ideal weight?'. I'm trying to find the combination of numbers from the 'weights' set that will sum up to the user input.   </p>
<pre><code>import itertools
weights = [3, 3, 7.5, 7.5, 10]
weightint = int(input('ideal weight? '))
result = [seq for i in range(len(weights), 0, -1) for seq in itertools.combinations(weights, i) if sum(seq) == weightint]
print(result)
</code></pre>
<p>Can someone help explain what I'm doing wrong. Thank you!</p>

<p>Not sure whats wrong with your terminal. Consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>argparse</code></a> instead of <code>input</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import itertools
import argparse

MY_WEIGHTS = [3, 3, 7.5, 7.5, 10]

def find_weight(w):
    result = [seq for i in range(len(MY_WEIGHTS), 0, -1) for seq in itertools.combinations(MY_WEIGHTS, i) if sum(seq) == w]
    return result

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('-w', '--weight', required=True, type=int, help='The weight')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    result = find_weight(args.weight)
    print('result: {}'.format(result))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Then call it from command line with <code>--weight</code> or <code>-w</code>:</p>
<pre><code>python3 ./weight.py --weight 10

result: [(10,)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Your code seems to work for me... Perhaps try a different terminal to execute the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is your python file name?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GhasemNaddaf weight.py</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and how do you run it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nothing about this code would repeat the input prompt.  Are you sure this is the <b>exact</b> code you're running?</span>
