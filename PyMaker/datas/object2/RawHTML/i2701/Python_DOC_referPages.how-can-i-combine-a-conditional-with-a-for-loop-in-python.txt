<p>I have a simple example I've drawn up.  I thought it was possible to combine if statements and for loops with minimal effort in Python.  Given:</p>
<pre><code>sublists = [number1, number2, number3]

for sublist in sublists:
    if sublist:
        print(sublist)
</code></pre>
<p>I thought I could condense the for loop to:</p>
<pre><code>for sublist in sublists if sublist:
</code></pre>
<p>but this results in invalid syntax.  I'm not too particular on this example, I just want a method of one lining simple if statements with loops.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>if you want to filter out all the empty sub list from your original sub lists, you will have to do something like below. this will give you all the non empty sub list.  </p>
<pre><code>print([sublist for sublist in sublists if sublist])
</code></pre>
<p>*edited for syntax</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Immediately solved this in the interpreter right after I posted.</p>
<pre><code>for x in ( x for x in sublists if x ):
</code></pre>
<p>Not as clean as I'd like, the nested if statement is more readable in my opinion.  I'm open to other suggestions if there is a cleaner way.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you can't simplify the syntax to a one-liner in python, but indeed have to type out all the lines chaining for loops and if statements.</p>
<p>An exception to this are list comprehensions (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">see here</a> at 5.1.3). They can be used to produce new lists from lists. An example:</p>
<pre><code>test_list = ["Blue Candy", "Apple", "Red Candy", "Orange", "Pear", "Yellow Candy"]
candy_list = [x for x in test_list if "Candy" in x]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You could use <code>filter</code> or a list comprehension/generator expression, but it's probably not going to end up any shorter than the first version and likely less readable. Just use the first version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is it, so clean!   Think it print needs () though, I'll mark this as answer because this is exactly what I was looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, very happy I helped :) Cheers!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I'll read up on comprehensions more because that seems to be the best method for these type of problems.</span>
