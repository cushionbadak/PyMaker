<p>I have a question that I couldn't find answere also during my testing.
Methods <strong>pos</strong> and <strong>neg</strong> doesn't work for me.</p>
<p>Let suppose we have a simple class:</p>
<pre><code>class Test:
def __init__(self,
             param=False):
    self.param = param

if __name__ == '__main__':
    c = Test()
    if c:  # which Python magic method is invoked here?
        print("OK")
    else:
        print("Nok")
</code></pre>
<p>And now, I want to override magic method which is invoked when I make statement: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>if c:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I don't know which? Please for advice.</p>

<p><code>__bool__()</code> if its defined<br/>
see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html</a></p>
<p>By default an object resolves to <code>True</code></p>
