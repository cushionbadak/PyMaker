<p>This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>rightPath = random.choice(North,East,South,West)

if selectPath == rightPath:
    print("You slay the monsterous beast and procceed further into the castle")
    print("This is just the start of your dangerous adventure")
else:
    print("The Monster attacks leaving you helpless on the floor")
    time.sleep(4)
    print("You Died")

<p>I want to make it choose a random direction from the list of North, East, South, West.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.choice</code></a> expects a sequence as a parameter.</p>
<p>So you might probably use:</p>
<pre><code>rightPath = random.choice(['North', 'East', 'South', 'West'])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should do it (you'll just have to replace <code>selectPath</code> with your input:</p>
<pre><code>rightPath = random.choice(['North','East','South','West'])
selectPath = 'North'
if selectPath == rightPath:
    print("You slay the monsterous beast and procceed further into the castle")
    print("This is just the start of your dangerous adventure")
else:
    print("The Monster attacks leaving you helpless on the floor")
    time.sleep(4)
    print("You Died")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">are you sure <code>North,East,South,West</code> is a list?  <code>random.choice</code> expects a list as a parameter.</span>
