<p>My file is not being closed properly and I cannot figure out why:</p>
<pre><code>open_sample_file = codecs.open(ssis_txt_files_2[a], 'r', "utf-16")


whatever = open_sample_file.readlines()

open_sample_file.close
print(open_sample_file)
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;codecs.StreamReaderWriter object at 0x0331F3B0&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Shouldn't the output return <code>None</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For one, you need to call the close method:</p>
<pre><code>open_sample_file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Then, what will result is a closed file, not <code>None</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; open_sample_file
&lt;closed file 'filename', mode 'r' at 0x109a965d0&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the usual way to handle files in Python is using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">with-statements</a>, which take care of closing the file for you:</p>
<pre><code>with codecs.open(filename) as open_sample_file:
    # do work
# the file will be closed automatically when the block is done
</code></pre>

<p>You have to call 
    <code>open_sample_file.close()</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>open_sample_file.close</code> is a function, you have to call it: <code>open_sample_file.close()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RafaelC also a good way for op to have figured this out is how would accessing a variable called close <i>actually close</i> the file without any <code>__get_attribute__</code> magic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you using <code>codecs.open</code> in Python 3? Just use the built-in <code>open</code>, which takes an <code>encoding</code> arg in Python 3. And if you open your files using <code>with</code> they'll be closed automatically.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@pm 2Ring: The file I am working with is utf-16 and that's the only way I could open the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, <code>with open(filename, 'r', encoding="utf-16") as open_sample_file:</code> will work fine. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why wouldn't I receive some sort of error message when I used open_sample_file.close? What happened in python since I didn't get an error message? I am just curious.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not an error: <code>open_sample_file.close</code> is just a way to referer to the method as something you can call without calling it. It can be useful to treat functions as data.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "Is just a way to referer to the method as something you can call without calling it."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you have a function <code>f</code>, sometimes you don't want to call it directly, for example if you write <code>map(f, [1,2,3])</code> (and not <code>map(f(), [1,2,3])</code>).</span>
