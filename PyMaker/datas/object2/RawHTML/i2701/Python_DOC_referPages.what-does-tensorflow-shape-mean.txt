<p>I'm getting the shape of a TensofFlow tensor as:</p>
<p><code>(?,)</code></p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40953146/5353461">This answer</a> says that the <code>?</code> means that the dimension is not fixed in the graph and it can vary between run calls.</p>
<p>What does the <code>?</code> mean in conjuction with the trailing comma?</p>
<p>Documentation chapter and verse would be appreciated. I find syntax very difficult to google.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The comma means that the dimension is represented as a <em>1-elem tuple</em> instead an int.</p>
<p>Each tensor, when created, is by default a n-dim:</p>
<pre><code>import tensorflow as tf
t = tf.constant([1, 1, 1])
s = tf.constant([[1, 1, 1],[2,2,2]])

print("0) ", tf.shape(t))
print("1) ", tf.shape(s))

0)  Tensor("Shape_28:0", shape=(1,), dtype=int32)
1)  Tensor("Shape_29:0", shape=(2,), dtype=int32)
</code></pre>
<p>However, you can reshape it to get a more "whole" shape (i.e. n<strong>X</strong>m / n<strong>X</strong>m<strong>X</strong>r... dim):</p>
<pre><code>print("2) ", tf.reshape(t, [3,1]))
print("3) ", tf.reshape(s, [2,3]))

2)  Tensor("Reshape_12:0", shape=(3, 1), dtype=int32)
3)  Tensor("Reshape_13:0", shape=(2, 3), dtype=int32)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Surely the <code>(X,)</code> indicates that the value is inside a container similar to a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-tuple" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tuple</code></a>, with <code>X</code> as the only element? Eg, <code>print(tuple([2]))</code> will output <code>(2,)</code>. <code>(?,)</code> should therefore mean that the shape of your tensor is 1d, and its length is  not fixed. Compare to output of numpy shape of 1d array</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@grshankar I already linked to that question :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So only the last dimension is dropped?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show an example with the output that I got?</span>
