<p>I have this tail recursive function here:</p>
<pre><code>def fib(n, sum):
    if n &lt; 1:
        return sum
    else:
        return fib(n-1, sum+n)

c = 998
print(fib(c, 0))
</code></pre>
<p>It works up to n=997, then it just breaks and spits a "maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison" <code>RuntimeError</code>. Is this just a stack overflow? Is there a way to get around it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is a guard against a stack overflow, yes. Python (or rather, the CPython implementation) doesn't optimize tail recursion, and unbridled recursion causes stack overflows. You can change the recursion limit with <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html#sys.setrecursionlimit" rel="noreferrer"><code>sys.setrecursionlimit</code></a>, but doing so is dangerous -- the standard limit is a little conservative, but Python stackframes can be quite big.</p>
<p>Python isn't a functional language and tail recursion is not a particularly efficient technique. Rewriting the algorithm iteratively, if possible, is generally a better idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Looks like you just need to set a higher recursion depth</p>
<pre><code>sys.setrecursionlimit(1500)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's to avoid a stack overflow. The Python interpreter limits the depths of recursion to help you avoid infinite recursions, resulting in stack overflows.
Try increasing the recursion limit (sys.setrecursionlimit) or re-writing your code without recursion.</p>
<p>from <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.setrecursionlimit" rel="noreferrer">python website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>sys.getrecursionlimit()</code></p>
<p>Return the current value of the recursion limit, the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack. This limit prevents infinite recursion from causing an overflow of the C stack and crashing Python. It can be set by setrecursionlimit().</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use a language that guarantees tail-call optimisation. Or use iteration. Alternatively, get cute with <a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/474088/" rel="noreferrer">decorators</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I realize this is an old question but for those reading, I would recommend against using recursion for problems such as this - lists are much faster and avoid recursion entirely.  I would implement this as:</p>
<pre><code>def fibonacci(n):
    f = [0,1,1]
    for i in xrange(3,n):
        f.append(f[i-1] + f[i-2])
    return 'The %.0fth fibonacci number is: %.0f' % (n,f[-1])
</code></pre>
<p>(Use n+1 in xrange if you start counting your fibonacci sequence from 0 instead of 1.)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Of course Fibonacci numbers can be computed in O(n) by applying the Binet formula:</p>
<pre><code>from math import floor, sqrt

def fib(n):                                                     
    return int(floor(((1+sqrt(5))**n-(1-sqrt(5))**n)/(2**n*sqrt(5))+0.5))
</code></pre>
<p>As the commenters note it's not O(1) but O(n) because of <code>2**n</code>. Also a difference is that you only get one value, while with recursion you get all values of <code>Fibonacci(n)</code> up to that value. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I had a similar issue with the error "Max recursion depth exceeded". I discovered the error was being triggered by a corrupt file in the directory I was looping over with os.walk. If you have trouble solving this issue and you are working with file paths, be sure to narrow it down, as it might be a corrupt file. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you often need to change the recursion limit (e.g. while solving programming puzzles) you can define a simple <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers" rel="noreferrer">context manager</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>import sys

class recursionlimit:
    def __init__(self, limit):
        self.limit = limit
        self.old_limit = sys.getrecursionlimit()

    def __enter__(self):
        sys.setrecursionlimit(self.limit)

    def __exit__(self, type, value, tb):
        sys.setrecursionlimit(self.old_limit)
</code></pre>
<p>Then to call a function with a custom limit you can do:</p>
<pre><code>with recursionlimit(1500):
    print(fib(1000, 0))
</code></pre>
<p>On exit from the body of the <code>with</code> statement the recursion limit will be restored to the default value.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong><code>resource.setrlimit</code> must also be used to increase the stack size and prevent segfault</strong></p>
<p>The Linux kernel limits the stack of processes.</p>
<p>Python stores local variables on the stack of the interpreter, and so recursion takes up stack space of the interpreter.</p>
<p>If the Python interpreter tries to go over the stack limit, the Linux kernel segfaults it.</p>
<p>The stack limit size is controlled with the <code>getrlimit</code> and <code>setrlimit</code> system calls.</p>
<p>Python offers access to those system calls through the <code>resource</code> module.</p>
<pre><code>import resource
import sys

print resource.getrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_STACK)
print sys.getrecursionlimit()
print

# Will segfault without this line.
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_STACK, [0x10000000, resource.RLIM_INFINITY])
sys.setrecursionlimit(0x100000)

def f(i):
    print i
    sys.stdout.flush()
    f(i + 1)
f(0)
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, if you keep increasing ulimit, your RAM will run out, which will either slow your computer to a halt due to swap madness, or kill Python via the OOM Killer.</p>
<p>From bash, you can see and set the stack limit (in kb) with:</p>
<pre><code>ulimit -s
ulimit -s 10000
</code></pre>
<p>Default value for me is 8Mb.</p>

<p>If you want to get only few Fibonacci numbers, you can use matrix method.</p>

<p>It's fast as numpy uses fast exponentiation algorithm. You get answer in O(log n). And it's better than Binet's formula because it uses only integers. But if you want all Fibonacci numbers up to n, then it's better to do it by memorisation.</p>

<p>As @alex <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/31731476/355230">suggested</a>, you could use a generator function to do this. Here's the equivalent of the code in your question:</p>

<p>I wanted to give you an example for using memoization to compute Fibonacci as this will allow you to compute significantly larger numbers using recursion:</p>
<pre><code>cache = {}
def fib_dp(n):
    if n in cache:
        return cache[n]
    if n == 0: return 0
    elif n == 1: return 1
    else:
        value = fib_dp(n-1) + fib_dp(n-2)
    cache[n] = value
    return value

print(fib_dp(998))
</code></pre>
<p>This is still recursive, but uses a simple hashtable that allows the reuse of previously calculated Fibonacci numbers instead of doing them again.</p>
