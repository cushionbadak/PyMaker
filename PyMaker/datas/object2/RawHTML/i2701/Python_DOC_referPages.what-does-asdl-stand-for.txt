<p>Abstract Syntax Description Lanuguage (ASDL) is a language designed to describe the tree-like data structures in compilers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The abstract syntax tree (AST) is a high-level representation of the program structure without the necessity of containing the source code; it can be thought of as an abstract representation of the source code. The specification of the AST nodes is specified using the <a href="http://asdl.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Zephyr Abstract Syntax Definition Language (ASDL)</a> <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0339/#wang97" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wang97</a>. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0339/#id13" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 339 -- Design of the CPython Compiler</a></p>
