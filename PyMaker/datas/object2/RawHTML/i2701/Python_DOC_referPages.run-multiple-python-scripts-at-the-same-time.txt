<p>Is there a way to run multiple python scripts simultaneously in vsc. I mean while there is already a script running, I would like to run another script. When I try I get "code is already running".
In spyder-ide I simply open a new IPython console and run the new script in this newly opened console.</p>

<p>You can always open a terminal terminal window -- with either <code>Python: Create Terminal</code> or <code>Open New Terminal</code> -- and launch the script(s) manually in separate terminals.</p>

<p>If you need to coordinate execution and communicate between these programs, you'll need to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">threading</a>. If the scripts can run independently, you can run them manually at the same time from a terminal, or use a subprocess call from the first script:</p>
<pre><code>subprocess.call(['python', 'secondscript.py', secondscript_arg1, secondscript_val1,...]).
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It is not related to vsc or spyder but hope this might give you some thought.  People use Python for everything, from short scripts to running Instagram. ðŸ˜ƒ .  If you want to execute multiple files at once you could consider a shell script or using something like <b><i>subprocess</i></b> in Python's stdlib to run multiple files simultaneously.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much, I appreciate your help. These scripts do not need to communicate between each other. Was just wondering if there is a simple intuitive way in vsc as the case is with spyder to run more than one script independently at the same time with just some clicks.</span>
