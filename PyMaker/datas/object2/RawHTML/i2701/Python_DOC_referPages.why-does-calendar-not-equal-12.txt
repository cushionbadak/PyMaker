<p>I'm new to python and was trying to create a list of month names. I noticed something odd:</p>
<pre><code>len(calendar.month_name) == 12

False
</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone explain to me why the length of month names is not 12?</p>
<p>Thanky you for any advice!</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.month_name" rel="noreferrer">Quoting the documentation:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This follows normal convention of January being month number 1, so it has a length of 13 and <code>month_name[0]</code> is the empty string.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The reason is because <code>calendar.month_name[0] = ''</code> this is probably to keep things simple for the rest of the months. So January is the first month or month number 1 and is also therefore <code>calendar.month_name[1]</code> and so on. This is probably just meant for simplicity. Since index 0 is empty and index 12 is December there are "13" months. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">have you tried <code>print(len(calendar.month_name))</code> and see what it outputs?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That would only confirm that <code>len(calendar.month_name)</code> is some value that isn't 12; it wouldn't explain why it is whatever it is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ElyFialkoff the output of print(len(calendar.month_name)) is 13</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look below at my answer and the answer posted by @jwodder, which is basically the same thing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok thank you for the help, that makes sense... but I though everything in python started with 0, guess i was wrong :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">All sequences <i>do</i> start with 0, which is why a dummy name is stored as element zero so that the "regular" month numbers line up with the list indices.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>month[0]</code> is empty <code>''</code>, <code>month[1]</code> is <code>"January"</code>, <code>month[2]</code> is <code>"February"</code> and so on.</span>
