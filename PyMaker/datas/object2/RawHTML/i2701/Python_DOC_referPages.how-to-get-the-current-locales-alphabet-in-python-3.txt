<p>In Python 2 you could do the following to get the current locale's character set:</p>
<pre><code>import string
print string.letters
</code></pre>
<p>However, in Python 3 the string module's locale-dependent constants (e.g. <code>string.letters</code>, <code>string.lowercase</code>, <code>string.uppercase</code>, etc.) were removed.</p>

How can I get the current locale's character set using Python 3?</p>

<p>You can get the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/by_type/core_data.alphabetic_information.main.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">exemplar characters</a> for each locale using the <a href="https://github.com/ovalhub/pyicu" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pyicu</a> module:</p>
<pre><code>import locale
from icu import LocaleData

default, encoding = locale.getdefaultlocale()
languages = [default] + ['en_US', 'fr_FR', 'es_ES']

for language in languages:
    data = LocaleData(language)
    alphabet = data.getExemplarSet()
    print(language, alphabet)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<pre><code>pt_BR [a-zà-ãçéêíò-õú]
en_US [a-z]
fr_FR [a-zàâæ-ëîïôùûüÿœ]
es_ES [a-záéíñóúü]
</code></pre>
<p>To get the current locale is enough to do:</p>
<pre><code>default, _ = locale.getdefaultlocale()
data = LocaleData(default)
alphabet = data.getExemplarSet()
print(default, alphabet)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">My guess is the functionality was removed because it had issues and was an oversimplification in the first place. You might have to try a different approach such as looking at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.category" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>unicodedata.category</code></a> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wim I don't think it can be done with the standard library. <code>unicodedata.category</code> doesn't give detailed locale information. <code>re</code> has <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.LOCALE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">locale-aware</a> alpha testing with <code>\w</code>, etc but it only works on 8-bit locales and "The use of this flag is discouraged as the locale mechanism is very unreliable".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unicode CLDR defines <a href="http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/by_type/core_data.alphabetic_information.main.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">exemplar characters</a> for each locale, which seems to be what you want.  Unfortunately, I currently can't find the file that these charts are derived from.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's exactly what I'm looking for! Thank you!</span>
