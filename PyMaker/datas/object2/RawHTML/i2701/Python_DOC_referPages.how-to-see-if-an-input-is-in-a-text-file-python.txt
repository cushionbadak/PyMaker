<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I am a student at a school learning the basics of python. I was given a project that I had to complete. I was given a text file with some names, if the user inputs the name that is in the text file then  it would print a message. If not then it would print another message saying something.</p>
<p>I have begun with my code, however, I cant seem to figure out how I can use the if and in command. Can someone give me some hints or solutions?</p>
<p>I have tried to put it in a list and then use the if and in command. It didnt work because of append. I dont know how to remove a word from a list. I can use slice method but it would seem too complicated.</p>
<pre><code>a=input('Nickname idea: ')
classes=[]
c=open('class.txt')
while a:
 classes.append(a)
 print(classes)
 if a == c:
   print('That nickname is already taken!')
 else:
   print('Great name!')
 a=input('Nickname idea: ')
 classes.remove(classes[0])
</code></pre>
<p>the text file is named 
class.txt and the contents are
    Ali
    Alakazam
    Alberto
    AJ
    Bob
    Bobby
    Kat
    Katie
    Timmy
    Tim-tam
thanks.</p>

<p>I have trouble understanding what you are exactly asking for, hopefully this resolves your question.</p>
<pre><code>a = input('Nickname idea: ')
classes = []
c = open('class.txt')
txt = c.read()
while a:
    classes.append(a)
    print(classes)
    if a in txt:
        print('That nickname is already taken!')
    else:
        print('Great name!')
    a=input('Nickname idea: ')
    classes.remove(classes[0])
</code></pre>
<p>You can merely read the text file in to a string and check with the if-in statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<pre><code>filename = 'name_list.txt'

with open(filename) as f_obj:
    usernames = f_obj.read()

name_to_check = input("Enter name: ")

if name_to_check in usernames:
    print("Hello, " + name_to_check)
else:
    print("Name not found.")
</code></pre>
<p>This is what you are looking for, from what you descirbed.</p>
<p>First step would be to open the file containing the list of whatever you want to check.<br/> Next we can run <code>read()</code> to assign all of that text to <code>usernames</code>.<br/>From there you can run and <code>if name_to_check_ in usernames</code> and <code>else</code> to return seperate responses.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">After opening the file you will need to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read its contents</a> before you compare to the user's input.  If each name is on a separate line you can iterate over the lines. but you may need to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods" rel="nofollow noreferrer">strip or split</a> the line for the comparison to work.  Try some of the examples in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Tutorial</a> using your file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Above code seemed to be working as your intentions when I tested out. It'd be nice if you can add some details to what you exactly are asking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the help. I was never taught how the read() worked.</span>
