<p>I already did some research but i cant find the solution or help for my doubt.</p>
<p>Im doing coursera python course, and i have an optional exercise that i not figuring out the solution.</p>
<p>So the exercise is a kinda simple, "Write a program that receave a number and check if the receave number has, at least, one equal adjacent number." EX: 12256 (adjacent number), 123456 (doesnt have adjacent number) Only using while loop and/or if statment. So list and lens aren't allowed to use.</p>
<p>I did like this:</p>
<pre><code>    x = int(input("Number: "))

    while (x != 0):
        resto = x % 10
        x = (x - resto) //10
    if resto == resto:
        print("yes")
    else:
        print("no")
</code></pre>
<p>The question, here, is that i not figuring out how to evaluate my if statement to false. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help =)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>a version that is close to yours. note that the <code>else</code> statement of the <code>while</code> loop is only executed if the while loop terminates normally - not via <code>break</code>. </p>
<pre><code>num = int(input('enter number: '))

prev = num % 10
num //= 10

while num:
    cur = num % 10
    if cur == prev:
        print('yes')
        break
    prev = cur
    num //= 10
else:
    print('no')
</code></pre>
<p>you put your <code>if</code> statement <strong>after</strong> the while loop - it should be inside it. and it should compare <code>resto</code> to something else (<code>cur</code> and <code>prev</code> in my code).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you need to check each digit of a number, don't convert it into an <code>int</code>. Then you can test each digit:</p>
<pre><code>num = input('enter number: ')
index = 0
prev = None
while index &lt; len(num):
    if num[index] = prev:
        print('yes!')
        break
    prev = num[index]
    index += 1
else:
    print('no!') # no same adjacent digit
</code></pre>
<p>The else clause executes if the while loop terminates without encountering <code>break</code>. If there is no break, then there were no adjacent same digits. I haven't included any type checking to make sure the input is a number</p>

<p>The solution to this is</p>
<pre><code>if resto == (x % 10):
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre><code>if resto == resto:
</code></pre>
<p>Think about it: is there <em>any possible scenario</em> where <code>resto</code> is not going to be equal to itself?</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>resto == resto</code> will always be <code>True</code>... and what is an 'equal adjacent number'? equal in what sense?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you post an 'expected output' with a certain input? This will help clarify your question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try</a> statements?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">only while and if. I mean i only learned while and if statement in the course until now. So i assume i only can use them. Is getting annoying for me puiff lol</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Haaa i got it now. Well done and thanks for the easy explanation =) and thanks everyone too for the given help :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah yes I shall refactor.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I already did this change and always returns false even if the inserted number has an adjacent</span>
