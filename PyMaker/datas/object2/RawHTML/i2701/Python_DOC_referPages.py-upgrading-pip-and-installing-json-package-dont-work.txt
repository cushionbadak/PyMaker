<p>Q1. I entered <code>python -m pip install --upgrade pip</code> and it answered that regularly worked. But, when I check it again by <code>pip list</code>, it was found that the version has been not changed. How can I solve this problem?</p>

<p>JSON is part of python's standard library. </p>
<p>You don't need to install it, just import json </p>

<p>I've finally solved the problem of Q1 by deleting pips of the previous version directly and installing its newest version again like the below. :</p>
