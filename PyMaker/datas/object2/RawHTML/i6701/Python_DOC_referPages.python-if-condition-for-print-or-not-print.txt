<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is a basic math problem. I want to calculate least amount of banknotes to be paid.</p>
<p>Here is my code and working well. </p>
<pre><code>total_payment = int(input("Please enter the total amount: "))

Dollar50 = int(total_payment // 50)
remaining_money = total_payment % 50

Dollar20 = int(remaining_money // 20)
remaining_money = remaining_money % 20

Dollar10 = int(remaining_money // 10)
remaining_money = remaining_money % 10

Dollar5 = int(remaining_money // 5)
remaining_money = remaining_money % 5

Dollar1 = int(remaining_money // 1)

print("We need {0} 50 dollar.".format(Dollar50))
print("We need {0} 20 dollar.".format(Dollar20))
print("We need {0} 10 dollar.".format(Dollar10))
print("We need {0} 5 dollar.".format(Dollar5))
print("We need {0} 1 dollar.".format(Dollar1))
</code></pre>
<p>But i want to print only if that type of banknote is used. For example if total amount is 101 dollar than program prints </p>
<pre><code>We need 2 50 dollar.  
We need 0 20 dollar.
We need 0 10 dollar.
We need 0 5 dollar.
We need 1 1 dollar.
</code></pre>
<p>But i dont want to print the ones with 0 value. I only want it to print </p>
<pre><code>We need 2 50 dollar.
We need 1 1 dollar.
</code></pre>
<p>This was an example of my struggle. I can not code this kind of loops or conditions. Thank you very much for any help.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>All you need is an if condition. </p>
<p>As an exercise, you should try to write <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11837973/2308683">DRY code</a>. Using loops and lists would look like this</p>
<pre><code>face_values = [50, 20, 10, 5, 1]
amounts = [0]*5
remaining_money = int(input("Please enter the total amount: "))

# While you have money left, calculate the next most 'dollar_value' you can use
i = 0  # This is an index over the 'dollars' list
while remaining_money &gt; 0:
  d = face_values[i]
  amounts[i] = remaining_money // d
  remaining_money %= d
  i+=1

denomination = "dollar bill"
denomination_plural = denomination + "s"

# Iterate both values and amounts together and print them
for val, amount in zip(face_values, amounts):
  if amount == 1:  # Filter out any non-positive amounts so you don't show them
    print("We need {} {} {}.".format(val, amount, denomination))
  else if amount &gt; 1:
    print("We need {} {} {}.".format(val, amount, denomination_plural))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of writing an <code>if</code> statement for all of these just <code>zip</code> them together and use a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>counts = [Dollar50, Dollar20, Dollar10, Dollar5, Dollar1]
ammounts = [50, 20, 10, 5, 1]
for i, j in zip(counts, ammounts):
    if i:
        print("We need {} {} dollar.".format(i, j))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use </p>
<pre><code>if Dollar50:
  print("We need {0} 50 dollar.".format(Dollar50))
</code></pre>
<p>if the value is 0, it won't print anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One way to do this would be to make an array to store the values of all the bills to loop through however this would require a bit of a rewrite, to make it work with what you have currently you need an if tree</p>
<p>for example </p>
<pre><code>if Dollar50 &gt; 0:
     print("We need {0} 50 dollar.".format(Dollar50))
</code></pre>
<p>you can continue this logic down for all different bill sizes </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Speaking simplistically, just add an if statement around each print statement checking for a 0.</p>
<pre><code>if Dollar50 != 0:
    print("We need {0} 50 dollar.".format(Dollar50))
if Dollar20 != 0:
    print("We need {0} 20 dollar.".format(Dollar20))
</code></pre>
<p>Continue that for each item.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"I can not code this kind of loops or conditions" --- First, there are no loops here. Second, why not? Any errors when you tried? What were they?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem i had was to check if a condition has a value or not. I tried to code like for every value print if they had value but i couldn't. I didn't know this  way (if Dollar20:) means if Dollar20 has a value then print.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can see that <code>bool(0) == False</code>. <code>if Dollar20</code> is the same as <code>if Dollar20 == 0</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So after i saw your great answer below i wanted to ask what sources would you suggest the beginners like me to find this kind of examples and solutions to examine them. Thank you very very much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The official website is fine. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much. I am a beginner and this kind of solution ways teach a lot to me and i guess to other beginners. We really need this sort of solutions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much it worked. So i changed my code to 	if Dollar50: 		print("We need {0} 50 dollar.".format(Dollar50))  	if Dollar20: 		print("We need {0} 20 dollar.".format(Dollar20))  	if Dollar10: 		print("We need {0} 10 dollar.".format(Dollar10))  	if Dollar5: 		print("We need {0} 5 dollar.".format(Dollar5))  	if Dollar1: 		print("We need {0} 1 dollar.".format(Dollar1))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what about accepting the answer as it's the general trend here. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the answer but i accept the upper one.</span>
