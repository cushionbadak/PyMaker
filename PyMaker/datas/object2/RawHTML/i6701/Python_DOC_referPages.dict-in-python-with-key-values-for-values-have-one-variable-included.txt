<p>I have a dict in python with key values and for values I have one variable included in it . I want to change the value of variable at run time. How to do that as it initializes the dict at inital.</p>
<p>Suppose it is as:</p>
<pre><code>number = ""
dict = { "a": ["welcome" + number + " Back"] }   # number = ""
</code></pre>
<p>Now if I do as <code>number = 45</code> somehow calculated. I want to auto-update the dict to as :</p>
<pre><code>dict={ "a" :["welcome" + number + " Back"] }    # number = 45
</code></pre>
<p>But dict is updated at initial stage and it is not changing value of number at run time.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>int</code>s are immutable in Python, but you could do a similar thing with a mutable structure, like a <code>list</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; number = [""]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d={"a":["welcome Back", number]} 
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'a': ['welcome Back', ['']]}
&gt;&gt;&gt; number[0] = 45
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'a': ['welcome Back', [45]]}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case the <code>dict</code> contains a reference to the mutable <code>list</code>, so the <code>dict</code> is updated when the <code>list</code> changes.</p>

<p>Instead of self-referencing dictionary values I'd recommend you just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">classes</a> instead.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a possible way to achieve what you want:</p>
<pre><code>dct = {
    "a": lambda: ["welcome {} back".format(dct["number"])],
    "number": ""
}

for number in ["one", "two", "three"]:
    dct["number"] = number
    print(dct["a"]())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can use list of list    </p>
<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; n = ['']
    &gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'a': ["welcome", n, "back"]}
    &gt;&gt;&gt; d
    {'a': ['welcome', [''], 'back']}
    &gt;&gt;&gt; n[0] = 45
    &gt;&gt;&gt; d
    {'a': ['welcome', [45], 'back']}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">If i have used a list inside dict that means there must be other elements in list which i ll be using. So that's why I am concatenating it with that number making it as one element only</span>
