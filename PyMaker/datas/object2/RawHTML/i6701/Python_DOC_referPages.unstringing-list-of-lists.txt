<p>I have an empty list X = []. I am appending a bunch of list of lists into X, which contain a bunch of floats as strings. When I print X, this is what I get(for example - there are actually way more numbers and list):</p>
<pre><code>[["['2.58', '0.35', '.754',...]\n","['2.58', '0.35', '.754',...]\n"]]
</code></pre>
<p>How do I make everything into lists and floats? So nothing will be a string? </p>
<p>I tried numerous for loops, but nothing worked. </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ast.literal_eval</code></a> to get rid of the <code>\n</code> characters like so:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ast import literal_eval
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [["['2.58', '0.35', '.754']\n","['2.58', '0.35', '.754']\n"]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; final = [[float(j) for j in i] for i in map(literal_eval,l[0])]
&gt;&gt;&gt; final
[[2.58, 0.35, 0.754], [2.58, 0.35, 0.754]]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>If the list is like the one in the comments, then just replacing <code>l[0]</code> with <code>l</code> in the code snippet above would fix any error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ast import literal_eval
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ["['2.58', '0.35', '.754']\n","['2.58', '0.35', '.754']\n"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; final = [[float(j) for j in i] for i in map(literal_eval,l)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; final
[[2.58, 0.35, 0.754], [2.58, 0.35, 0.754]]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Convert them to lists of floats before you append them to the list of list? You could also convert them afterwards but it's simpler if you do it as early as possible. So it would be helpful to know how you process "whatever" to begin with, not only what you end up with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">where is the input coming from ? consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pickle</a> instead of writing to a text file if possible.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>[map(float, eval(y.strip())) for y in X]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">you mean <code>map(literal_eval,l)</code> instead of <code>map(literal_eval,l[0])</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ah, my bad I just saw that it is a list of list of one element.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bulbus yes, the first time I did that mistake too :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It says, "malformed node or string." This is the malformed node or string:     ["['2.58', '0.35', '.754']\n","['2.58', '0.35', '.754']\n"]. How do I fix this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Goku241 If the list is the one in your comment then just replace <code>l[0]</code> in my code snippet with <code>l</code>, this should fix it</span>
