<p>I have a bit of a weird situation that I will try to explain the best I can. </p>
<p>I am using Python to launch photoshop and run a javascript file. But my goal is for python to generate the javascript first, then run it in photoshop. 
In order to do that I have python copying the javascript file, then replacing a single line of code and running this new copy.</p>
<p>When I run the original javascript file it works as intended with no problems. </p>
<p>When I run the copied javascript file it works as intended with no problems.</p>
<p>When I run the copied javascript file that has the line replaced, it gives me an 8800 error.</p>
<p>At this point, even if I manually type the replaced line to match the original javascript file. I will still get an 8800 error. </p>
<p>Does python somehow write files differently? </p>
<p>Here is the code I am using to replace the copy and replace the javascript contents:</p>
<p><div class="snippet" data-babel="false" data-console="true" data-hide="false" data-lang="js">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override"><code>from shutil import copyfile


jsx_file = r'E:\PS\_javascript_constructor_template.jsx'
jsx_file_new = r'E:\PS\_javascript_constructor_template_new.jsx'
copyfile(jsx_file, jsx_file_new)

with open(jsx_file_new, "r") as fin:
    data = fin.read()
    with open(jsx_file_new, "w") as fout:
        fout.write(data.replace("!REPLACEME!",'"E:\PS\MockVar.csv"'))</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>SIDE NOTE: I am only doing this because I have no idea how to pass an argument from python into the javascript file I am subprocess calling. </p>
<p>I would much rather send an argument to the javascript file than build new files enitrely.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you'd rather send an argument to the Photoshop script, I'd recommend using interprocess communication.  You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">socket</a> module in Python and the Socket object in Extendscript to send messages back and forth.  Check out External Communications Tools in the <a href="https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/scripting/pdfs/javascript_tools_guide.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Adobe Tools Guide</a> for more information.  </p>
