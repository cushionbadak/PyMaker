<p>I am a newbie in python and I was trying to figure out, how do I differentiate between 2 lists which are as shown below</p>
<pre><code>['11-10-2017', '12:15 PM', 'B.ARTS', 'Linguistics', '', '', 'German', 'Name']
</code></pre>
<p>And </p>
<pre><code>['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']
</code></pre>
<p>The Problem is, that both the lists have <code>''</code> element, and I want a solid Condition which satisfies that if a list has an item which is a string and not <code>''</code>. It is also possible that list has 7 <code>''</code> and just one item is a string.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any</code></a> with the list as argument :</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; any(['', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''])
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; any(['', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Test', ''])
True
</code></pre>
<p>If there's any element which is truthy (i.e. non empty), it will return <code>True</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It seems you want to filter empty strings from a list:</p>
<pre><code>lst = ['11-10-2017', '12:15 PM', 'B.ARTS', 'Linguistics', '', '', 'German', 'Name']
[item for item in lst if item]
# ['11-10-2017', '12:15 PM', 'B.ARTS', 'Linguistics', 'German', 'Name']
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>I want a solid Condition which satisfies that if a list has an item which is a string and not <code>''</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The condition is <code>if item</code>.  To clarify, <code>''</code> is an empty string.  During iteration, if the <code>item</code> is <code>''</code>, the condition is <code>False</code> and thus the item is excluded from the result.  Otherwise, the condition is <code>True</code> and the result is added to the list. See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18491777/truth-value-of-a-string-in-python">this post</a>.</p>
<p>This behavior is because <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/truth.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">all objects in Python have "truthiness"</a> - all objects are assumed <code>True</code> except for a few, such as <code>False</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>""</code>, <code>None</code> and empty collections.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<p>I need a condition which is satisfied if there are no <code>''</code>, in the
  string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use <code>all</code> for checking this. </p>
<pre><code>In [1]: s1 = ['11-10-2017', '12:15 PM', 'B.ARTS', 'Linguistics', '', '', 'German', 'Name']
In [2]: s2 = ['11-10-2017', '12:15 PM']

In [4]: all(x for x in s1)
Out[4]: False

In [5]: all(x for x in s2)
Out[5]: True
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The easiest way to see if there is not a <code>''</code> in your list is to use <code>not in</code>:</p>
<pre><code>tests = [
    ['11-10-2017', '12:15 PM', 'B.ARTS', 'Linguistics', '', '', 'German', 'Name'], 
    ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 
    ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    ['', '', '', '', '', 'x', '', '']]

for t in tests:
    print '' not in t, t
</code></pre>
<p>Which would display:</p>
<pre><code>False ['11-10-2017', '12:15 PM', 'B.ARTS', 'Linguistics', '', '', 'German', 'Name']
False ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']
True ['a', 'b', 'c']
False ['', '', '', '', '', 'x', '', '']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">i need a condition.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is your expected output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This wasn't exactly what I wanted, but it was the closest to my expected output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Shouldn't it be same as <code>filter(None, lst)</code>? Please see my earlier comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Unni, yes <code>list(filter(None, lst))</code> gives the same output in a different way.  <code>filter</code> is the functional approach  that uses an inherent default predicate, which may not be obvious to the OP.  Here I am using a list comprehension to demonstrate that <code>''</code> is an empty, Falsey string, which gets filtered because it negates the condition.  Still, I feel the OP may be looking for something else, which requires clarification in the question.</span>
