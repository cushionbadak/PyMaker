<p>I have long four list , I want to check if a word in list_1 and if that word in list_2 with another string (but that substring is still exist) same for all four list , if that substring exist in all four list then print.</p>
<p>So suppose i have these four list :</p>
<pre><code>a=["1","2","45","32","76"]
b=["5","8","345","32789","43"]
c=["362145","9932643","653"]
d=["194532","5423256","76"]
</code></pre>
<p>so i wanted to match <code>45</code>,<code>32</code> in list a and in list b also because <code>34</code>5 contain 34 but it also contain 45 3<code>45</code> and <code>32</code>789 contain 32 and list c contain 3621<code>[45]</code> and 99<code>[32]</code>643 contain 32 and so in list d 19<code>[45]</code>32 contain 45 and 542<code>[32]</code>56 contain 32 so if a substring (example 45) is in all 4 list then print.</p>
<p>I tried with "in" method but that doesn't work and then i tried with set() which also doesn't work , How can i do it ?</p>
<p>P.S : is there any method without looping all over list ? because this module is submodule of a large program and that program already contain many loops , if possible without loop otherwise all suggestion welcome :)</p>

<p>Google helped me out.</p>
<p>Use <code>any("45" in s for s in a)</code> this to check if the number is in list a, and so on. It returns <code>True</code> if it finds it.</p>
<p>Edit: Here's an example.</p>
<pre><code>check = input("What number are you looking for?")

if any(check in s for s in a):
    if any(check in s for s in b):
        if any(check in s for s in c):
            if any(check in s for s in d):
                print("something")

<p>You can use <code>in</code> with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any()</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>all()</code></a> functions:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = ["1", "2", "45", "32", "76"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = ["5", "8", "345", "32789", "43"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = ["362145", "9932643", "653"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = ["194532", "5423256", "76"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x, y = "45", "32"
&gt;&gt;&gt; all(any(x in i for i in lst) and any(y in i for i in lst) for lst in [a, b, c, d])

<p>Like you described it, its impossible to avoid loops but you can use comprehension lists.</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<pre><code>a = ["1","2","45","32","76"]
b = ["5","8","345","32789","43"]
c = ["362145","9932643","653"]
d = ["194532","5423256","76"]

result = []
for x in a:
    if (any(x in s for s in b) and
        any(x in s for s in c) and
        any(x in s for s in d)):
        result.append(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Every <code>any</code> use an iterable to check if the item <em>x</em> exist in any string of the list <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> or <em>d</em>.</p>
<p>This construction could be rewritten using list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>result = [x for x in a
          if (any(x in s for s in b) and
              any(x in s for s in c) and
              any(x in s for s in d))]
print(result)
</code></pre>
<p>You get:</p>
<pre><code>['2', '45', '32']
</code></pre>
