<p>If I do s.recv(6) does that receive the first 6 bytes of data? I am looking at the documentation, and getting confused.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>bufsize</code> value in <code>recv</code> sets <em>maximum</em> amount of data received. So - yes, you will receive first 6 bytes or less (it depends of actual  length of data).

<span class="comment-copy">Can you be any more explicit about what's confusing you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I guess I just want to know if doing recv(6) receives the first 6 bytes of data or not lol</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@ItachiSan I guess I'm just having a hard time understanding why you couldn't tell that from the documentation, or what reason you have to think it might do anything other than receiving the first 6 bytes of data.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there a way to increase the byte size of a string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can set a larger <code>bufsize</code></span>
