<p>I think you need to read the tutorials in more detail as you are making the task too complicated. This code might give you an idea of the how the task might be achieved.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried using <code>python -m pdb &lt;your filename here.py&gt;</code> or inserting <code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()</code> statements to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python debugger, pdb</a> to figure out what's going on?  Alternatively, have you tried inserting <code>print</code> statements to see values?  You are being downvoted because you are not telling us what you've tried.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"not evaluating properly" is not a useful problem description. What were you trying to do, and what visibly goes wrong? If you get an error message, post it, including stack trace, code-formatted. If you get wrong output, post it, as well as the exact output you expected to get, code-formatted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChazingtonPerk you define the <code>multiply</code> function but you don't use it or call it <code>multiply()</code> anywhere in your code, so when you print <code>product</code> it never get updated from <code>1</code></span>
