<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I have a school assignment to create a GUI which allows me to add students to a database which I have made. I figured out how to search for students but I am struggling with being able to add students. I am required to export this data to a CSV file. I have managed to export it but it comes with commas, speech marks and brackets, which I don't want. This is my code so far for the section that doesn't work:</p>
<pre><code>def reveal(self):
    firstname = ("Forename: ", self.forename_entry.get())
    lastname = ("Surname: ", self.surname_entry.get())
    gender_ = ("Gender: ", self.gender_entry.get())
    birthdate = ("DOB: ", self.DOB_entry.get())
    Student_ID = ("Student ID Number: ", self.studentID_entry.get())
    home = ("Address: ", self.address_entry.get())
    phone = ("Home phone number: ", self.homephone_entry.get())
    group = ("Tutor Group: ", self.tutorgroup_entry.get())
    school_email = ("School Email", self.sch_email_entry.get())

    with open("StudentIDs.csv", "a") as f:
        w = csv.writer(f, quoting = csv.QUOTE_ALL)
        writeit = (['\n', firstname, '\n', lastname, '\n', gender_, '\n', birthdate, '\n', Student_ID, '\n', home, '\n', phone, '\n', group, '\n', school_email])
        w.writerow(writeit)
        self.invalidtext.configure(text = "Student added")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">

<pre><code>record ={}
record["Forename"] = self.forename_entry.get()
record["Surname"] = self.surname_entry.get()
... an so on

with open("StudentIDs.csv", "a") as f:
    w = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=list(record.keys()))
    if firstRow:
        w.writeheader()
    w.writerow(record)

<span class="comment-copy"><code>(thing, other_thing)</code> is not string concatenation; you may have gotten confused by how <code>print(thing, other_thing)</code> prints two things as if they were joined by a space. String concatenation is <code>+</code> (though you do need to make sure you have strings).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">user2357112 By replacing the ',' with '+' I instead get an error:        TypeError: Can't convert 'tuple' object to str implicitly</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@stovfl Oh sorry. I'm new to this I don't ask many questions. But yeh the output looks something like this:                                                                 "('Forename: ', 'TEST15')"," ","('Surname: ', 'TEST15')"," ","('Gender: ', 'TEST15')"," ","('DOB: ', 'TEST15')"," ","('Student ID Number: ', 'TEST15')"," ","('Address: ', 'TEST15')"," ","('Home phone number: ', 'TEST15')"," ","('Tutor Group: ', 'TEST15')"," ","('School Email', 'TEST15')"</span>
