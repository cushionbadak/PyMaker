<p>I am working on school problem where they give the equation for identifying if ISBN number is valid and give us ten inputs(numbers) and a stop input at the end. </p>
<p>This was my code:</p>
<pre><code>a=str(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
d=int(input())
e=int(input())
f=int(input())
g=int(input())
h=int(input())
i=int(input())
j=int(input())
u=input() #this is where stop is usually at
if j==int((int(a)+(2*b)+(3*c)+(4*d)+(5*e)+(6*f)+(7*g)+(8*h)+(9*i))%11):
    print("OK")
elif j!=int((int(a)+(2*b)+(3*c)+(4*d)+(5*e)+(6*f)+(7*g)+(8*h)+(9*i))%11):
    print("WRONG")
elif a=="stop":
    print("")
</code></pre>
<p>The last two lines are there because one of the answers was just one line input: "stop". In this case, the code shouldn't give any output but my code doesn't work and since there is only one input, it gives out an EOF on second line of the code. How can I make this work?</p>

<p><code>j</code> is either equal to <code>int((int(a)+(2*b)+(3*c)+(4*d)+(5*e)+(6*f)+(7*g)+(8*h)+(9*i))%11)</code> (which btw you don't have to compute twice...), or not. So <code>elif a=="stop":</code> is never reached. Test for <code>a=="stop"</code> first thing.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Try to work through the logic with a pencil and paper then translate that to your code.  You really need to figure out your homework yourself.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried that, but its still giving me eof at line 2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">FIRST thing: <code>a=str(input())</code> then test for <code>a=="stop"</code> immediately (i.e at line 2)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">tried it and now its giving me eof at line 3 instead of 2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is there actually a "stop" in your file? <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, at a in this case we are talking about</span>
