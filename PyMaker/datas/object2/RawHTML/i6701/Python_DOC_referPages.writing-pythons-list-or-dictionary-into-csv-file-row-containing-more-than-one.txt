<p>I am just starting up Python!!</p>
<p>i want to make a CSV file where i have a dictionary and i want to print each member of it in its own column in the same row. </p>
<p>like i have an array of dictionaries and i want each row to represent one of them and each column of each row to represent an item inside.</p>
<pre><code>import csv


"... we are going to create an array of dictionaries and print them all..."

st_dic = []

true = 1

while true:
    dummy = input("Please Enter name, email, mobile, university, major")
    x = dummy.split(",")

    if "Stop" in x:
        break

    dict ={"Name":x[0],"Email":x[1],"Mobile":x[2],"University":x[3],"Major":x[4]}
    st_dic.append(dict)

f2 = open("data.csv" , "w")

with open("data.csv", "r+") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    for item in st_dic:
        writer.writerow([item["Name"], item["Email"], item["Mobile"] , item["University"] , item["Major"]])
    f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>the thing i output now is a row which contains the data in the first dictionary, i just want them seperated, each in its own column within its row.</p>

<p>It is surprising there are so many questions here that try to fill in some data in <code>while</code> loop and <code>input()</code> command. In all the fairness, this is not python best use case.</p>
<p>Imagine you had the dictionary just filled in your code:</p>
<pre><code>dict1 = {'name': "Kain", 'email': 'make_it_up@something.com'} 
dict2 = {'name': "Abel", 'email': 'make_it_up2@otherthing.com'}
dict_list = [dict1, dict2]
</code></pre>
<p>After that you can export to csv easily:</p>
<pre><code>import csv 
with open('data.csv', 'w') as f: 
    w = csv.DictWriter(f, ['name', 'email'], lineterminator='\n')
    w.writeheader()
    for row in dict_list:  
        w.writerow(row)
</code></pre>
<p>Note there are many questiona about <code>csv</code> module on SO 
as well as there are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#examples" rel="nofollow noreferrer">examples in documentation</a>. </p>
