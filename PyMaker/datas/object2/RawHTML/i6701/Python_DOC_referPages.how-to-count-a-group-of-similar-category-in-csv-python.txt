<p>I am currently working on reading a csv file in python. I wanted the program to be able to count the number of 'Feedback'/'Complaints' etc whenever I run it.</p>
<p>Some example from the csv file is as follow:</p>
<pre><code>Category        Description  
Feedback        Lighting
Feedback        Lighting
Complaints      Pest
Feedback        Lighting
Complaints      Pest
</code></pre>
<p>From the above, I wanted it to show something like</p>
<pre><code>Total Feedback - 3
Description - Lighting
Total Complaints - 2
Description - Pest
</code></pre>
<p>How am I supposed to let it count the amount of feedback/what is the description.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> to count the feedbacks and complaints.</p>
<pre><code>import csv
from collections import Counter


counter = Counter()

with open('temp.csv', newline='') as csv_file:
    reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
    next(reader, None)  # Skip the header.
    for category, description in reader:
        counter[category] += 1

print(counter)
# Counter({'Feedback': 3, 'Complaints': 2})
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try to import it in pandas:</p>
<pre><code>`import pandas as pd


complaints = pd.read_csv('../data/311-service-requests.csv')
 print complaints.value_counts()
print complaints['complaint'].value_counts()
print complaints['feedback'].value_counts()`
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The question is a bit unclear. Do you just want to count how many feedbacks or complaints are in the file or do you want to count how many feedbacks are <code>lighting</code> or anything else?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@skrx I want to count the total number of Feedbacks and complaints that are in the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then you could use a <code>collections.Counter</code>. I'll post an example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! This is what I am trying to do.</span>
