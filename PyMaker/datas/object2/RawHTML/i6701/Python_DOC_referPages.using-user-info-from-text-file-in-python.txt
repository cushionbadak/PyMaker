<p>I have a file called data.txt with a student numbers and names:</p>
<pre><code>123, Bobbie Smith
456, Suzie Lan
789, Alex Palmer
</code></pre>
<p>What i'm trying to achieve is printing these information in sentences like this:</p>
<pre><code>Bobbbie Smith has student number: 123
Suzie lan has student number: 456
Alex Palmer has student number: 789
</code></pre>
<p>So what I tried to do is putting every line on data.txt in a seperate list inside a list using:</p>
<pre><code>file = open("data.txt", "r")
studentInfo = file.readlines()
file.close()
lines = [[line] for line in studentInfo]

&gt;&gt;&gt; print(lines)
[['123, Bobbie Smith\n'], ['456, Suzie Lan\n'], ['789, Alex Palmer']]
</code></pre>
<p>Is this to good direction or should I do this using a completely different way?</p>

<p>You <strong>don't</strong> want to use <code>file</code> as a variable name, as it is a function. So you basically override it (thanks <strong>@Mark Tolonen</strong>).</p>
<p>You can slightly modify it and use context manager to read the file, and using <code>string.format</code> print the data in a readable fashion</p>
<pre><code>with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = [line.split(',') for line in f.readlines()]

for s in lines:
    print '{} has student number: {}'.format(s[1].strip(), s[0].strip())
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Bobbie Smith has student number: 123
Suzie Lan has student number: 456
Alex Palmer has student number: 789
</code></pre>
<p>I'm striping new lines from line because <code>print</code> statement prints a new line by default for every iteration</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>use csv to avoid strip lines.    </p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('data.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as csv_f:
    reader = csv.reader(csv_f)

    for line in reader:
        print('{x[1]} has student number: {x[0]}'.format(x=line))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>one way is using the numpy library</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

x, y = np.loadtxt("data.txt", dtype = str, delimiter = ',', unpack = True)
for (i,j) in zip(x,y):
print(j+" has student number: "+i)

<p>Here's a couple of ways to achieve what you want using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re</a>:</p>
<p>If you don't need to store the processed lines and just wanna print the output directly:</p>
<pre><code>with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    for l in f.readlines():
        try:
            age, name = re.findall(r'\s*(\d+),\s*(.*)', l)[0]
            print('{} has student number: {}'.format(name, age))
        except:
            pass
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to store the processed lines as a list of tuples, maybe something like this would do it:</p>
<pre><code>with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = [v[0]
             for v in [re.findall(r'\s*(\d+),\s*(.*)', l) for l in f.readlines()] if v]
    for age, name in lines:
        print('{} has student number: {}'.format(name, age))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>file</code> is not a keyword in Python, or you wouldn't be able to assign to it. It <i>is</i> a function in Python 2, but this question is tagged Python 3 where it is no longer a function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried it but i get an error; list index out or range. I think this is because for instance the first line becomes: ['123, Bobbie Smith']. So using s[1] has no value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tymo you're right, I've forgot to split the items. I've updated the answer with a working example</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tymo if you found my answer helpful, please kindly consider upvoting it, thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Vinny I did, but since I have less than 15 reputation is does not chance the  public displayed post score. Sorry!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Short and to the point. Good use of the standard library.</span>
