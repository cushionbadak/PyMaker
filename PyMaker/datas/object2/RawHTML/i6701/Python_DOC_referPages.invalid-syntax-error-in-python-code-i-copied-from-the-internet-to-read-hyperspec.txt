<p>this is the part of code that I copied in my program. my python is version 3.6. and used Ipython console to run it. but there is this error that I can't understand. could you please help me?</p>

<p>They are showing an <em>interactive Python session</em>, including output of the commands entered. You copied the <em>print result</em>, there to be part of a demo.</p>
<p>The printed output is not Python syntax. Stick to the lines starting with <code>In [&lt;digit&gt;]:</code>.</p>
<p>For the first and second examples, together:</p>

<p>adjusted for Python 3, the code executed is</p>
<pre><code>from spectral import *
img = open_image('92AV3C.lan')
img.__class__
print(img)
img.shape
pixel = img[50,100]
pixel.shape
band6 = img[:,:,5]
band6.shape

<p>Most of this is just producing extra output aimed at helping you to understand what kind of objects are being produced and how they model data.</p>
