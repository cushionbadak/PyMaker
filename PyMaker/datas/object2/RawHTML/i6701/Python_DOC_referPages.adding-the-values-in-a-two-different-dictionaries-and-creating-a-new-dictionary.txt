<p>I have the following two dictionaries</p>
<pre><code>scores1={'a':10,'b':20,'c':30,'d':10} #dictionary holds value scores for a,b,c,d
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>scores2={'a':20,'b':10} #this dictionary only has scores for keys a and b
</code></pre>
<p>I need to collate and sum the scores for keys a and b in both dictionaries to produce the following output:</p>
<p>The answer could be 'done' using one of the following two methods (and there may be others I'd be interested to hear)</p>
<p><strong>1. Using the creation of a new dictionary:</strong></p>
<p>finalscores={a:30,b:30}  #adds up the scores for keys a and b and makes a new dictionary </p>
<p>OR</p>
<p><strong>2. update the scores2 dictionary</strong> (and add the values from scores1 to the scores2 corresponding respective values</p>
<p>An accepted answer would show both the above with any suitable explanation as well as suggest any more astute or efficient ways of solving the problem.</p>
<p>There was a suggestion on another SO answer that the dictionaries could simply be added:</p>
<p>print(scores1+scores2)
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11011756/is-there-any-pythonic-way-to-combine-two-dicts-adding-values-for-keys-that-appe">Is there any pythonic way to combine two dicts (adding values for keys that appear in both)?</a></p>
<p>But I want to do this in the simplest method possible, without iterator imports or classes</p>
<p>I have also tried, but to no avail:</p>
<pre><code>newdict={}
newdict.update(scores1)
newdict.update(scores2)
for i in scores1.keys():
    try:
        addition = scores[i] + scores[i]
        newdict[i] = addition

   except KeyError:
        continue
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>For the first solution:</strong></p>
<pre><code>scores1={'a':10,'b':20,'c':30,'d':10} #dictionary holds value scores for a,b,c,d
scores2={'a':20,'b':10} #this dictionary only has scores for keys a and b

finalscores=dict((key, sum([scores1[key] if key in scores1 else 0, scores2[key] if key in scores2 else 0])) for key in set(scores1.keys()+scores2.keys()))
print(finalscores)
# outputs {'a': 30, 'c': 30, 'b': 30, 'd': 10}
</code></pre>
<p>This iterates through a set of all keys in both dictionaries, creates a tuple with the values of the key in both dictionaries <strong>or 0</strong> and then passes said tuple through the <code>sum</code> function adding the results. Finally, it generates a dictionary.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>In multiple lines, to understand the logic, this is what the one-liner does:</p>
<pre><code>finalscores = {}
for key in set(scores1.keys()+scores2.keys()):
    score_sum = 0
    if key in scores1:
        score_sum += scores1[key]
    if key in scores2:
        score_sum += scores2[key]
    finalscores[key] = score_sum
</code></pre>
<p><strong>For the second solution:</strong></p>
<pre><code>scores1={'a':10,'b':20,'c':30,'d':10} #dictionary holds value scores for a,b,c,d
scores2={'a':20,'b':10} #this dictionary only has scores for keys a and b

for k1 in scores1:
    if k1 in scores2:
        scores2[k1] += scores1[k1]  # Adds scores1[k1] to scores2[k1], equivalent to do scores2[k1] = scores2[k1] + scores1[k1]
    else:
        scores2[k1] = scores1[k1]

print(scores2)
# outputs {'a': 30, 'c': 30, 'b': 30, 'd': 10}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Actually, I cannot find information elsewhere on how to do this specific task - in terms of merging values from two different dictionaries. Surely it is a valid question that will help numerous other SO users</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks so much - are you able to put solution 1 with the new dict in a format with indentation(on different lines). Very hard to follow the logic otherwise...Huge thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry, force of habit. I added the code broken in multiple lines, so it's actually understandable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">An error for the first: for key in set(round1scoresdict.keys()+round2scoresdict.keys()): TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'dict_keys' and 'dict_keys' &gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is <code>round1scoresdict</code> a <code>dict</code>? Because apparently <code>round1scoresdict.keys()</code> doesn't return a list, but a <code>dict_keys</code> object. Same with <code>round2scoresdict</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">And the second one works - answer accepted. Could you possibly comment the second answer please explaining this line in particular: scores2[k1] += scores1[k1]</span>
