<p>My use case is pretty simple; I have an asynchronous function (calling AWS KMS for decryption) that I need to run multiple times, in parallel. In Node, I would simply use the <a href="https://caolan.github.io/async/docs.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">async package's</a> <code>each</code> function. However, I'm unfamiliar with how Python handles asynchronicity. Time is short here, so ideally whatever package I used would be easy to setup, and would have a function similar to the above: loop through an array of data and perform a parallel, asynchronous task on each of it's items.</p>
<p>Thanks much for your help!</p>
