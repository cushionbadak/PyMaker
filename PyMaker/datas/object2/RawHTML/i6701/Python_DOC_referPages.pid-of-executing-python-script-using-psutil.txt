<p>I want to use <code>psutil</code> to terminate my script I am currently executing. My problem is that I would like to kill it with the ID but I don't know how to get the <code>pid</code> of my script. </p>
<p>I know I can terminate with the names of processes, but I think thats not a pretty solution.</p>
<p>Has anyone an idea how to make this work?</p>
<p>I have set up my Pi with the PiCamera, a GUI and some sensors. I am using the <code>cv2</code> library and the problem is that the windows won't close.
Therefore, I googled how to close them but there wasn't any solution I could use. Killing the process is ok for me.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<pre><code>import psutil

def on_terminate(proc):
    print("process {} terminated with exit code {}".format(proc, proc.returncode))

procs = psutil.Process().children()
for p in procs:
    p.terminate()
gone, still_alive = psutil.wait_procs(procs, timeout=3, callback=on_terminate)
for p in still_alive:
    p.kill()
</code></pre>
<p>I found this snippet in the documentation. How can I make this run with <code>pid</code>'s?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">can you give the link to your script? with that, solving your problem would be easier.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">do you want to kill your own script? why not <code>sys.exit()</code>?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">How are you executing the script? For example, <code>subprocess.Popen</code> objects have a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.pid" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pid</code></a> attribute.</span>
