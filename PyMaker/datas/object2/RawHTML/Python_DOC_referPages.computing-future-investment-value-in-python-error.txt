<p>So I am trying to solve this problem; The image contains some sample output.</p>
<p><img alt="Problem to solve" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tbHPx.png"/></p>
<p>This is the code I have so far and I'm not sure where I am going wrong. Problem is it is not displaying the correct figures in the sample run.</p>
<pre><code>investmentAmount=0
intr=0

   monthlyInterestRate=0

def futureInvestmentValue(investmentAmount, monthlyInterestRate, years):

    futureInvestmentValue=investmentAmount*(1+monthlyInterestRate)**years
    return futureInvestmentValue

def main():

  investmentAmount=int(input("The amount invested: "))
  intr=int(input("Annual interest rate: "))
  monthlyInterestRate=intr/1200

  print("Years Future Value")
     for yrs in range(1,31):

    FIV=futureInvestmentValue(investmentAmount,monthlyInterestRate,yrs)
      print(yrs, format(FIV, ".2f"))
 main()
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are confusing months and year. In your code, you are actually calculating increments in months despite having named the variable <code>years</code>.  And you probably want to convert the interest rate to a <code>float</code> rather than an <code>int</code> to allow a wider range.</p>
<p>Here is the corrected code (I did not change the formula):</p>
<pre><code>def future_investment_value(investment_amount, monthly_interest_rate, months):
    return investment_amount * (1 + monthly_interest_rate)**months

def main():
    investment_amount = int(input("The amount invested: "))
    yearly_interest_rate = float(input("Annual interest rate: "))
    monthly_interest_rate = yearly_interest_rate / 1200

    print("Months future value")
    for months in range(1, 30*12 + 1):
        fut_val = future_investment_value(
            investment_amount, monthly_interest_rate, months)

        if months % 12 == 0:
            print('{:3d} months | {:5.1f} years ==&gt; {:15.2f}'.format(
                months, months / 12, fut_val))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see in the output, at 60 months (5 years), the output is what you expected:</p>
<pre><code>The amount invested: 10000
Annual interest rate: 5
Months future value
 12 months |   1.0 years ==&gt;        10511.62
 24 months |   2.0 years ==&gt;        11049.41
 36 months |   3.0 years ==&gt;        11614.72
 48 months |   4.0 years ==&gt;        12208.95
 60 months |   5.0 years ==&gt;        12833.59
 72 months |   6.0 years ==&gt;        13490.18
...
336 months |  28.0 years ==&gt;        40434.22
348 months |  29.0 years ==&gt;        42502.91
360 months |  30.0 years ==&gt;        44677.44

<span class="comment-copy">Can you edit your post to include some input/output/expected output examples? Tell us <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> it's not working and we can help you fix it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GreenCloakGuy I have edited the post</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are your equations correct?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are mixing monthly and yearly interest rates. Your <code>futureInvestmentValue</code> should calculate the value per month and not per year.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Ralf It worked.</span>
