<p>If I have an inheritance hierarchy of exception classes, and in a <code>try</code> block if I want to attempt to handle a more specific (derived) exception before a more general one, do I just put the <code>except</code> statement for the derived class above the one for the base class?</p>
<p>Is this how I would do it?</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>class MyException(BaseException):
    pass

class AnotherException(MyException):
    pass

try:
    raise AnotherException()
except AnotherException:
    print('Caught YetAnotherException!')
except MyException:
    print('Caught MyException!')

print('Done.')
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried it out, and it works, but I'm surprised I am unable to find any documentation about this.</p>

<p>Check out the documentation of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement" rel="nofollow"><code>try</code> statement</a> in the Python language reference. The relevant bit is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When an exception occurs in the try suite, a search for an exception handler is started. This search inspects the except clauses in turn until one is found that matches the exception.</p>

<p>Some of the commonly used Exception clause form with try statement</p>
<pre><code>**except: Catch all (or all other) exception types.
**except name: Catch a specific exception only.
**except name as value: Catch the listed exception and assign its instance.
**except (name1, name2): Catch any of the listed exceptions.
**except (name1, name2) as value: Catch any listed exception and assign its instance.
**else: Run if no exceptions are raised in the try block.
**finally: Always perform this block on exit.

<span class="comment-copy">Hmmm...I didn't think "in turn" was explicit enough, but I guess it is. My bad.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice list but it doesn't answer the question</span>
