<p>I am very new to python and I have done this challenge on codecademy.</p>
<pre><code>def spam():
    eggs = 12
    return eggs

print spam()
</code></pre>
<p>This works on codecademy but if I put it in IDLE and run it I get an error saying invalid syntax. So I am a bit contused about what is happening. Can any one help.</p>

<p>IDLE is most likely running it using Python 3, where print() is a function. The below code should fix it.</p>
<pre><code>def spam():
    eggs = 12
    return eggs

print(spam())
</code></pre>

<p>You must be running IDLE for Python 3.x, in which <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print</code></a> is no longer a statement but a function.  Thus, you need to call it as such:</p>
<pre><code>def spam():
    eggs = 12
    return eggs

print(spam())
</code></pre>
<p>Your code worked in CodeAcademy because they are using Python 2.x.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Check for the version of python you are working on. It should an issue in python3.0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Its version 3.2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Coursera has a couple courses on Python 3.x if you're interested - Codecademy is still teaching 2.x (which is still popular amongst a lot of Python programmers and worth learning the differences of - but not the most recent version).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks I will take a look at them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">(You could also install Python 2.7 if you're learning Python 2; a lot of the good learning material does still teach this version, and it's still very widely used. In a perfect world everyone would move to Python 3.4 immediately, but... it's not a perfect world.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks that emplanes it.</span>
