<p>I'm trying to put together multiple tuples but do not know how.  I know how to create a tuple, but I'm not quite sure how to put them together.  I want to keep on appending (not actually appending because I don't want a list).  I'm pulling a string out of each line and putting all of the tuples together  </p>
<pre><code>x = (132, 534, 4)
y = (345, 531, 1)
z = (212, 421, 5)
</code></pre>
<p>What I want returned</p>
<pre><code>(132, 534, 4), (345, 531, 1), (212, 421, 5)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The tuple in your example can be created like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; # The following line is equivalent to:  new_tuple = (x, y, z)
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_tuple = x, y, z
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_tuple
((132, 534, 4), (345, 531, 1), (212, 421, 5))
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>However, because tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation) sequences, you will need to create a new one each time you want to "append" to it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; new_tuple = x, y, z
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_tuple
((132, 534, 4), (345, 531, 1), (212, 421, 5))
&gt;&gt;&gt; w = 1, 2, 3  # This is another tuple that needs to go inside new_tuple
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_tuple = x, y, z, w  # So, we have to rebuild new_tuple to include it
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_tuple
((132, 534, 4), (345, 531, 1), (212, 421, 5), (1, 2, 3))
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is why it would be best to just use a list, which is a mutable (can be changed after  creation) sequence that has an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow"><code>append</code></a> method:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; new_list = [x, y, z]  # Square brackets make a list
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_list
[(132, 534, 4), (345, 531, 1), (212, 421, 5)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; w = 1, 2, 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_list.append(w)  # Add w to new_list without rebuilding it
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_list
[(132, 534, 4), (345, 531, 1), (212, 421, 5), (1, 2, 3)]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>the easiest way to do that may be this</p>
<pre><code>x = (132, 534, 4)
y = (345, 531, 1)
z = (212, 421, 5)

r = x, y, z

<span class="comment-copy">You want to merge them or create a tuple of tuple ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm guessing you want some parentheses to encapsulate that floating list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">tuple of a tuple @jordsti</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The use of a tuple and your intention to "keep on appending" are mutually exclusive. Only a list can be appended to.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While tuples look kinda-sorta like lists, tuples are meant for "record-like" rows of data that can be of varying types that wouldn't naturally grow. If you're storing a series of data, or a column of "field-like" things, use a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why <code>z, y, x</code>? That should be <code>x, y, z</code> - but then how would you "keep on appending" to it (as the OP wants to do)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're right, I miss spell the order.</span>
