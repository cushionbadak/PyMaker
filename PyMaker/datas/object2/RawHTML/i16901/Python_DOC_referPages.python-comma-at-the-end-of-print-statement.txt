<p>I've just started learning python from the source <code>learnjavathehardway</code>.</p>
<p>There was a "fun" code that goes as follows</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    for i in ["/","-","|","\\","|"]:
        print "%s\r" % i,
</code></pre>
<p>Now what it does is that at the same place in my console, it prints the different character one by one. (Try it yourself if you did not get what I said)</p>
<p>Basically,it prints <code>/ - | \ |</code> in quick succession, <strong>at the same place</strong>. </p>
<p>If I remove comma from the end of print statement, it prints each character in a new line.</p>
<p>Now I want to know, why is it printing out at the same place? And not one after the other?  Thanks</p>

<p>That's because of the <code>\r</code>, which is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return" rel="nofollow"><code>carriage return &lt;CR&gt;</code></a> character in ascii. It basically resets the cursor to the start of the line.</p>
<p>The comma at the end of that line is because in python 2.7, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print</code></a> <em>statement</em> adds a newline. Using the comma, the newline is not added.</p>
<p>In python 3.x, <code>print</code> is no longer a statement but a function. You can provide the <code>end</code> keyword-argument to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print()</code></a> to determine the ending character, which defaults to a newline, <code>\n</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Ohh, did not see that. Thanks alot. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow, didn't know that <code>\r</code> and <code>,</code> in print worked that way - to print things in the same line (in Python2). Is the <code>\r</code>+<code>,</code> behaviour different on Mac since the newlines are different codes? Since it's <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/4599936/1431750">not reading from a file</a> I wouldn't think it's automatically handled for a <code>print</code> statement/function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe that the functionality is cross-platform. The <code>carriage return</code> is the same in all of the three major platforms, it's just the line separator that differs (from <code>\r\n</code> to <code>\n</code>), e.g windows prepends the carriage return to the line feed.</span>
