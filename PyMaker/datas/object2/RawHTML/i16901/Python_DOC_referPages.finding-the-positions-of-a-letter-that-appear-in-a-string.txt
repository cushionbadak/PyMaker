<p>I have a fairly simple question that I just can't seem to figure out. How would one find what I'm asking for in the title in Python 2.7? Let me explain better: </p>
<p>Say you have a string:</p>
<pre><code>string = "banana"
</code></pre>
<p>I know how you would find the position of a letter if it appears once in a string, for example:</p>
<pre><code>string.find("b")
</code></pre>
<p>would return 0.</p>
<p>Now if I wanted to find all of the places a letter appears if it appears more than once in the string, I have a problem. For example:</p>
<pre><code>string.find("a")
</code></pre>
<p>would return 1, however, it also appears in slots 3 and 4 too.</p>
<p>What I'm asking is how would I be able to determine which slots a letter appears in a string, even if it appears more than once? Thanks for your time. </p>

<p>If you use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow"><code>enumerate</code></a>, you can get a list of the indexes at which a certain character appears:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; string = "banana"
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(enumerate(string))  # Just to demonstrate
[(0, 'b'), (1, 'a'), (2, 'n'), (3, 'a'), (4, 'n'), (5, 'a')]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; [x for x,y in enumerate(string) if y == 'a']
[1, 3, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [x for x,y in enumerate(string) if y == 'n']
[2, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
