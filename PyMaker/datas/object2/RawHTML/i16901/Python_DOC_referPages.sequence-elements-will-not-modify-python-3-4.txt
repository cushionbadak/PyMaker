<p>Okay, no more questions after this:</p>
<pre><code>import random

lotto = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
index = 0

while index &lt;= 6:
    lotto[index] = random.randrange(1, 9)
    index = index + 1
    print("Lotto number",index,"is",lotto[index],"!")
</code></pre>
<p>I cannot seem to find what is up with why these sequence elements will not be modified. The index and the sequence are handled properly but the <code>lotto[index] = random.randrange(1, 9)</code> line seems to be useless. It doesn't change anything in the sequence at all. I know I'm missing something but I've been staring at this thing for a long time now and just cannot see what I'm screwing up. I've changed the elements and it outputs everything properly it just won't change the sequence elements. Halps?</p>

<p>You are always referring to the next element while printing. Just swap the print line with the increment line like this</p>
<pre><code>print("Lotto number",index,"is",lotto[index],"!")
index = index + 1
</code></pre>
<p>When you print something like this, you can use <code>format</code> function, like this</p>
<pre><code>print("Lotto number {} is {} !".format(index, lotto[index]))
</code></pre>
<p>Apart from that, you can use a for loop and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow"><code>range</code></a> function, like this</p>
<pre><code>for index in range(7):
    lotto[index] = random.randrange(1, 9)
    print("Lotto number", index, "is", lotto[index], "!")
</code></pre>
<p><code>range</code> function will give the values from 0 to 6, one at a time, on each iteration.</p>
<p>Even better, you can create a new list using list comprehension, like this</p>
<pre><code>lotto = [random.randrange(1, 9) for index in range(7)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">In Python that's called a <i>sequence</i> (specifically, a <i>list</i>), not an array.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Awesome! I didn't pay attention to the index because I needed it as a sort of counting in the print statement. Thanks for that.</span>
