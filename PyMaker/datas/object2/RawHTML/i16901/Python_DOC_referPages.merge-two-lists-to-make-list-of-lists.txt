<p>I want to merge the 2 lists:</p>
<pre><code>a = [1,2,3,4,"a"]
b = [1,2,3,4,"b"]
</code></pre>
<p>to make:</p>
<pre><code>[[1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4], ["a","b"]]
</code></pre>
<p>What would be the best way of doing this?</p>
<p>Also if possible I would like to append further lists as well like so:</p>
<pre><code>c = [5,6,7,8,"c"]
</code></pre>
<p>to get</p>
<pre><code>[[1,1,5], [2,2,6], [3,3,7], [4,4,8], [5,5,9], ["a","b","c"]
</code></pre>
<p>You can assume the lists are the same length.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow"><code>zip</code></a> and a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4, "a"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [1, 2, 3, 4, "b"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_lst = [list(x) for x in zip(a, b)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_lst
[[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3], [4, 4], ['a', 'b']]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>Regarding your updated question, if you later want to add in another list, you can use this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = [5, 6, 7, 8, "c"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [x + [y] for x,y in zip(new_lst, c)]
[[1, 1, 5], [2, 2, 6], [3, 3, 7], [4, 4, 8], ['a', 'b', 'c']]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, if you have all three lists to begin with, all you need to do is give another argument to <code>zip</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4, "a"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [1, 2, 3, 4, "b"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = [5, 6, 7, 8, "c"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_lst = [list(x) for x in zip(a, b, c)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_lst
[[1, 1, 5], [2, 2, 6], [3, 3, 7], [4, 4, 8], ['a', 'b', 'c']]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<h1>Variation of accepted solution</h1>
<p>As it is explicitly declaring items for sublist, it seems to me a bit more readable:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3,4,"a"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [1,2,3,4,"b"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = [5,6,7,8,"c"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [[ai, bi, ci] for ai, bi, ci in zip(a, b, c)]
[[1, 1, 5], [2, 2, 6], [3, 3, 7], [4, 4, 8], ['a', 'b', 'c']]
</code></pre>
<h1>Shortes variant using <code>map</code></h1>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; map(list, zip(a, b, c))
[[1, 1, 5], [2, 2, 6], [3, 3, 7], [4, 4, 8], ['a', 'b', 'c']]

<span class="comment-copy">yes i realise it maybe a duplicate question but i did not find anything by searching</span>
<span class="comment-copy">He's not asking for a list of tuples, but a list of lists</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why people frenetically downvote such a question ?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@StéphaneLaurent You might even argue that the list element is different from the referenced question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, i will delete the question now as it is a duplicate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it is not exactly a duplicate, @Dave</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks - and for answering my edited update as well. i understand it much better now.</span>
