<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have this code wrote in Python:</p>
<pre><code>with open ('textfile.txt') as f:
     list=[]
     for line in f:
          line = line.split()
          if line: 
              line = [int(i) for i in line] 
              list.append(line)
     print(list)
</code></pre>
<p>This actually read integers from a text file and put them in a list.But it actually result as :</p>
<pre><code>[[10,20,34]]
</code></pre>
<p>However,I would like it to display like:</p>
<pre><code>10 20 34
</code></pre>
<p>How to do this? Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>You probably just want to add the items to the list, rather than appending them:</p>
<pre><code>with open('textfile.txt') as f:
    list = []
    for line in f:
        line = line.split()
        if line:
            list += [int(i) for i in line]

    print " ".join([str(i) for i in list])
</code></pre>
<p>If you append a list to a list, you create a sub list:</p>
<pre><code>a = [1]
a.append([2,3])
print a    # [1, [2, 3]]
</code></pre>
<p>If you add it you get:</p>
<pre><code>a = [1]
a += [2,3]
print a    # [1, 2, 3]!
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>with open('textfile.txt') as f:
    lines = [x.strip() for x in f.readlines()]

print(' '.join(lines))
</code></pre>
<p>With an input file 'textfiles.txt' that contains:</p>
<pre><code>10
20
30
</code></pre>
<p>prints:</p>
<pre><code>10 20 30
</code></pre>

<p>It sounds like you are trying to print a list of lists.  The easiest way to do that is to iterate over it and print each list.</p>
<pre><code>for line in list:
    print " ".join(str(i) for i in line)
</code></pre>
<p>Also, I think <code>list</code> is a keyword in Python, so try to avoid naming your stuff that.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you know that the file is not extremely long, if you want the list of integers, you can do it at once (two lines where one is the <code>with open(...</code>. And if you want to print it your way, you can convert the element to strings and join the result via <code>' '.join(...</code> -- like this:</p>
<pre><code>#!python3
# Load the content of the text file as one list of integers.
with open('textfile.txt') as f:
    lst = [int(element) for element in f.read().split()]

# Print the formatted result.
print(' '.join(str(element) for element in lst))
</code></pre>
<p>Do not use the <code>list</code> identifier for your variables as it masks the name of the list type.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Don't print the list itself. You could iterate through the list and print each element, or your could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer">join</a> method for strings.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">formatting! it'd go a long way to helping you :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@thegrinner if I use print(' '.join(map(str,list))) it result as [10,20,34] theres still [ ]</span>
