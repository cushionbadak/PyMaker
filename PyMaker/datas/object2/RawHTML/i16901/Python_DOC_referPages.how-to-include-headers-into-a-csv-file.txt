<p>I have a csv file that doesn't include headers. How can I manually add the headers  i.e. add the headers to the top of the file</p>
<pre><code>GA, 11
LA, 12
NY, 122

<p>As <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23238541/how-to-include-headers-into-a-csv-file#comment35555447_23238541">Lutz Horn</a> pointed out, you can use <code>csv.writeheader</code> if you're using py3.2+. If you're using py2.7 like me, maybe this might help:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
myHeaders = ["Header1", "Header2"]
csvData = []
with open( 'myfile.csv','r+b' ) as csvfile:
    # Read the data
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE)
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerow(myHeaders)
    writer.writerows([row for row in reader])
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note</em>: <code>csv</code> doesn't have an insert/overwrite row method, so you need to read &amp; write the whole data. Should be trivial for small-to-medium sized files</p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> Previous code would append repeated data to the end of the file</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I got this error <code>TypeError: writerows() argument must be iterable</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">No need to load into memory and extend... write the header, then write the data: <code>writer.writerow(my_headers); writer.writerows(reader)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">its writing the headers in the row, not at the top</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JonClements Thanks! Edited the code! &amp; OP Isn't that what a header is? The <i>top</i> row?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok, now I get it. Its appending it the the previous file, and then writing the data after it. Thats why I have it in the middle.</span>
