<p>If you want to remove all Unicode characters from a string, you can use <code>string.encode("ascii", "ignore")</code>.</p>
<p>It tries to encode the string to ASCII, and the second parameter <code>ignore</code> tells it to ignore characters that it can't convert (all Unicode chars) instead of throwing an exception as it would normally do without that second parameter, so it returns a string with only the chars that could successfully be converted, thus removing all Unicode characters.</p>
<p>Example usage :</p>
<pre><code>unicodeString = "Héllò StàckOvèrflow"
print(unicodeString.encode("ascii", "ignore")) # prints 'Hll StckOvrflow'
</code></pre>

<p>In order to remove characters represented by unicode escape sequences, you need to use a unicode string.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code>s = d[key].replace(u'\u00a9', '')
</code></pre>
<p>However, as people have mentioned in comments, removing the copyright symbol might be a very bad idea, though it depends on what you're actually doing with the string.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">be aware that <code>\u00a9</code> is the copyright symbol. Removing that may have legal consequences.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Concur, removing the characters you cannot understand seems like the wrong way to solve this problem.  (The actual text has much more severe problems, but I guess that's out of scope for this site.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please explain "but didn't work". What happened? What did you expect to happen?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@André write that out as an answer, it seems to be what OP is looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You <i>should not</i> remove unicode characters - you hhave to DFEAL with then - please read: <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str</code></a> doesn't have a <code>decode()</code> method.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">(for what it's worth, <code>d['key'].replace("\u00a9","")</code> worked as intended for me on Python3.3)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AdamSmith it makes a difference in Python2.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah i was trying on py2.7</span>
