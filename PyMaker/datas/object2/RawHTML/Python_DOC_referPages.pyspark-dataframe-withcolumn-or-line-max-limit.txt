<p>I have a pyspark notebook created in databricks.  I have a dataframe, to which i need to add columns dynamically, and currently the number of columns are 186.  When I reach python line to a length of 10000, i dont see the color codings for None, Lit, etc. and my notebook cell fails to recognize the withcolumn declarations after the line size reaches 10000.</p>
<p>Is there any size limit for a line in python? If so, is there any better way to add these many columns to a dataframe, using a list?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Yes, There is a limit for selecting a no. of columns from a dataframe in databricks, You can select your all columns by using a list. Like this -</p>
<pre><code>df = prv_df.withColumn(******something*********)

cols = ['column_1'
       ,'column_2'
       ,
       ,
       ,
       ,'column_n']

new_df = df.select(cols)
</code></pre>
<p>I think it solve your issue.</p>
