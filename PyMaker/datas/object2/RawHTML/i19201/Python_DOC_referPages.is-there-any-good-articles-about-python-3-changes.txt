<p>I'm returning Python developer. I was working with 2.7 last time. And i want to read full list of new things and changes in 3.3 since 2.7. Does anyone know something good?</p>
<p>PS: Yeah, i know that there it is for me in the documentation, but i want a single article with some author's thoughts about these changes.</p>

<p>I found this <a href="http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/imprint_downloads/informit/promotions/python/python2python3.pdf" rel="nofollow">pdf</a> very informative. It is a free 4-page cheat sheet of differences provided by the publisher of "Programming in Python 3" book by Mark Summerfield.</p>
<p>In response to your PS, this is not an article, but a very easy to grasp categorized list of differences. </p>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html</a> <i>is</i> a single article, with Guido's advice on the changes. Hell, there's even a porting guide at the bottom. What else do you need?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, but i managed to find this already. I wanted different thing. Read my PS...</span>
