<p>I have been trying to do the same thing.  There is a information file about the blue tooth communication at <a href="http://us.mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/support/files/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">the mindstorms web site.</a>  If you are using python 3.3 or newer you can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html" rel="nofollow">sockets</a> to communicate.  I still have not gotten this to work.  If you are not using python 3.3 you could use pybluez.  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Normally bluetooth will create a transparent serial port. You don't need nothing special for bluetooth, but <a href="http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/pyserial_api.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">serial io for python</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">First use google and then if you can't find answer ask there.</span>
