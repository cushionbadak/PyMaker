<p>Hey guys so I am getting this "TypeError: 'int' object is not callable" error when I run this code, I did some research and I think it's something with my variable naming? Could someone please explain to me what is wrong?</p>
<pre><code>class account(object):
    def set(self, bal):
        self.balance = bal
    def balance(self):
        return balance
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my example run:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = account()
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.set(50)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.balance()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#12&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    a.balance()
TypeError: 'int' object is not callable
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are masking your method <code>balance</code> with a instance attribute <code>balance</code>. Rename one or the other. You could rename the instance attribute by pre-pending it with an underscore for example:</p>
<pre><code>def set(self, bal):
    self._balance = bal

def balance(self):
    return self._balance
</code></pre>
<p>Attributes on the instance trump those on the class (except for data descriptors; think <code>property</code>s). From the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#class-definitions" rel="noreferrer">Class definitions documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Variables defined in the class definition are class attributes; they are shared by instances. Instance attributes can be set in a method with <code>self.name = value</code>. Both class and instance attributes are accessible through the notation “<code>self.name</code>”, and an instance attribute hides a class attribute with the same name when accessed in this way.</p>
