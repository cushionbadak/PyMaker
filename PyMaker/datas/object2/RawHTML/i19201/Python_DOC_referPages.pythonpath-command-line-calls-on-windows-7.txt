<p>There are python scripts with command line arguments that I'd like to call from any location on my PC. </p>
<p>The idea is to share the corresponding package with others so they can open up a CMD window and run</p>
<pre><code>python thescript.py arg1 arg2
</code></pre>
<p>regardless of their location.</p>
<p>How do I setup the python path/ PATH environment variables?</p>
<p>I've setup a package in <code>site-packages</code>, added that path to $PATH and edited PYTHONPATH to include the module directory (which includes <code>__init__.py</code>), but CMD won't find the relevant scripts. </p>
<pre><code>python: can't open file 'thescript.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Python does <em>not</em> look up scripts on some sort of path.</p>
<p>You have 2 options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the full path:</p>
<pre><code> python /path/to/thescript.py
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Place the script in a directory that is on your <code>PATH</code>, make it executable (<code>chmod +x thescript.py</code>) and give it a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29" rel="nofollow">Shebang line</a>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/env python
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>The second option is probably preferable. On Windows, you can install <a href="https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/pylauncher" rel="nofollow"><code>pylauncher</code></a> to support shebang lines; if you use Python 3.3 or newer, it is <em>already</em> <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html#pep-397-python-launcher-for-windows" rel="nofollow">included with your Python installation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Another option would be to create a batch file for each script you care about, and put the batch file somewhere in your <code>PATH</code>, e.g. create a file called <code>thescript.bat</code> containing...</p>
<pre><code>@echo off
the\path\to\python.exe the\path\to\thescript.py %*
</code></pre>
<p>...then you can just run...</p>
<pre><code>thescript arg1 arg2
</code></pre>
<p>...which is about as terse a syntax as possible.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like I'll be specifying the full path. I don't think Windows (CMD -&gt; DOS window) supports shebang. I've edited the title to specify that this is a Windows question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2105469: updated to include information about <code>pylauncher</code>, which would make what you want work on Windows too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, problem solved.</span>
