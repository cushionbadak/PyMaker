<p>Let's say I have the following list:</p>
<pre><code>L = [1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>I want to get the following output:</p>
<pre><code>[[1], [2],[3]]
[[1], [2, 3]]
[[2], [1, 3]]
[[3], [1, 2]]
</code></pre>
<p>Except I'm not even sure if I phrased the question correctly. It's basically like non-repeating groups of permutations?</p>

<p>It's not particularly clear to me how you came to your output (another example or a better description may help), but the answer probably lies in <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools</code></a>, which contains a number of tools to work with combinations and permutations:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; data = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(zip(reversed(data), itertools.combinations(data, 2)))
[(3, (1, 2)), (2, (1, 3)), (1, (2, 3))]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I think I can write a program to generate your exact output, but I don't get how you get your output... Can you explain it more?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It would be useful to get a reason with the down-vote - while I agree this might not be the perfect answer, given the ambiguity of the question, it's the best possible. It's definitely not 'not useful'.</span>
