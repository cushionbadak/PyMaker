<p>I am working with python. I want to know whether or not any method is existed or not in same module. I think <code>getattr()</code> does this but I couldn't do. Here is sample code saying what really I want to do with.</p>
<pre><code>#python module is my_module.py
def my_func():
    # I want to check the existence of exists_method
    if getattr(my_module, exists_method):
       print "yes method "
       return
    print "No method"
def exists_method():
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>My main task is to dynamically call defined method. If it is not defined, just skip operations with that method and continue. I have a dictionary of data from which on the basis of keys I define some necessary methods to operate on corresponding values. for e.g. data is  <code>{"name":"my_name","address":"my_address","...":"..."}</code>. Now I define a method called <code>name()</code> which I wanted to know dynamically it really exists or not.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to look for the <em>name</em> as a string; and I'd use <code>hasattr()</code> here to test for that name:</p>
<pre><code>if hasattr(my_module, 'exists_method'):
    print 'Method found!"
</code></pre>
<p>This works if <code>my_module.exists_method</code> exists, but not if you run this code <em>inside</em> <code>my_module</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>exists_method</code> is contained in the <em>current</em> module, you would need to use <code>globals()</code> to test for it:</p>
<pre><code>if 'exists_method' in globals():
    print 'Method found!'
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir" rel="nofollow">dir</a>,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import time
&gt;&gt;&gt; if '__name__' in dir(time):
...     print 'Method found'
... 
Method found
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">If you closely see my post, you will definitely you find that your answer is not my solution. I already could do other things with your style. Anyway thanks for your reply.</span>
