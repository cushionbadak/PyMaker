<p>On Windows, I have uploaded a package using the following command:</p>
<p><code>python setup.py sdist bdist_wininst upload</code></p>
<p>However, due to my using Python on Windows, it uploads a zip file instead of a gzip file. How can I make it send a gzip along with it?</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/sourcedist.html" rel="nofollow">specify the formats</a> of the compressed source files:</p>
<pre><code>python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">There's nothing wrong with zip, though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@LennartRegebro - But what about *nix users?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">We have zip tools as well. In fact, many Unix users prefer to upload .zip.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This should be the accepted answer as it has has the important <code>upload</code> command at the end.  Also note that the order of the arguments is significant, you can't put <code>--formats</code> at the end.</span>
