<span class="comment-copy">My question is what is the advantages of .pkl file over .txt &amp; .csv. I got a code from client where some of the dictionaries &amp; data frames are saved in .pkl format..pkl file contains around 30,000,000.I would like to save the data in .txt format.As I'm going to use the data in pyspark &amp; I'm not finding way to read .pkl file in pyspark.So if I can get the benefits of .pkl file over .txt then I will do extensive search for reading .pkl file in pyspark otherwise I will save the data in .txt format &amp; will read it using pyspark</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you please elaborate it by giving some examples?I'm seeing a python code where data frame &amp; dictionary are saved in .pkl format.I'm checking why do we need to save these in .pkl file, why not in .txt or .csv file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using pickle will save the dataframe as a dataframe object, rather than exporting it. It can be faster, and if you intend to load it as a dataframe later, there is no real reason to go from df-&gt;csv-&gt;df. Saving to csv, for example, will require you specify the index label for the dataframe. Not a big deal, but by using pickel you're serializing the dataframe as a dataframe.</span>
