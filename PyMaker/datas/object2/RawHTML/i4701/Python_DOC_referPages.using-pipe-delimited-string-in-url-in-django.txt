<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to pass a pipe delimited string as a parameter in my url in django, but it fails to route to the respective view.</p>
<p>This is my pipe delimited string:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"main/1|adel|1|1989-09-19|1|1|test alert|2018-03-16-09-26-00|test module|1|1|test encounter"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and this is my url pattern:</p>
<pre><code>from django.conf.urls import url
from django.views.generic import RedirectView
from alerter import views

app_name = 'alerter'

urlpatterns = [

    url(r'^main/(?P&lt;message&gt;[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)/$',
    views.TheView.as_view({'get': 'view'}), name = 'main'),



]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>\w</code> doesn't match <code>|</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Unicode (str) patterns:</p>
<p>Matches Unicode word characters; this includes most characters that can be part of a word in any language, as well as numbers and the underscore. If the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.ASCII" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ASCII</code></a> flag is used, only <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</code> is matched (but the flag affects the entire regular expression, so in such cases using an explicit <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</code> may be a better choice).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adjust your pattern, e.g. by capturing <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_|]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>url(r'^main/(?P&lt;message&gt;[a-zA-Z0-9_|]+)/$',
    views.TheView.as_view({'get': 'view'}), name='main')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">your regex trying to look for <code>words</code> while you are passing words and special characters...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">one of the possible solution is replace <code>\w+</code> with <code>\S+</code> . or pass the message as url parameter</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe <code>\S+</code> will capture <code>/</code> in the URL, but yes, the solution is to use an appropriate regex.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">although i'm convinced it should work, it didn't, the url works if i used non delimited string but even if i used a hyphen as delimiter, it fails.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I frequently use hyphens in URLs. Maybe another rule is matching your URLs. What does "it fails" mean? Do you get a 404, or does a different view load? Please edit your question and add your whole <code>urls.py</code> file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i get a 404, will add my full file now</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@adelelsayed, you don't appear to have included <code>|</code> (or <code>-</code>, for that matter) in your regular expression. Take a close look at mine: I added <code>|</code> after <code>_</code>. (The hyphens in this expression are used to indicate ranges, not as literal hyphens.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i just forgot to write it here in stakoverflow, i included "- and space" to my regex, it turned out that i forgot about them.     url(r'^main/(?P&lt;message&gt;[ a-zA-Z0-9_|-]+)/$',     views.TheView.as_view({'get': 'view'}), name = 'main')</span>
