<p>I'm setting up python unit tests in VS Code using unittest, and running into some issues.  </p>
<p>I am able to run my tests by selecting Run Tests from the status bar, and by right-clicking my test file in Explorer.  When I do either of these, I see unit test output (e.g. "test_name ... ok" and "Ran 1 test in 0.002s") in the Python Test Log window, but I get a VS Code notification saying "No tests ran, please check the configuration settings for the tests."  I am also not seeing the Run Test | Debug Test code lens in the test file.  </p>
<p>I have followed the setup instructions in the VS Code docs here: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/unit-testing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/unit-testing</a>, but I'm wondering if there are other steps I'll need to follow to get proper integration with the IDE?</p>
<p>I am using VS Code version 1.12.1, on Windows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unittest supports simple test discovery. In order to be compatible
  with test discovery, all of the test files must be modules or packages
  (including namespace packages) importable from the top-level directory
  of the project (this means that their filenames must be valid
  identifiers).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read the <code>unittest Basic Example</code> there is not something about make tests files to a module.<br/>
So that's Why you can see the <code>Run Test | Debug Test code lens in the test</code> <strong>file</strong><br/>
But can't make test discovery discover it.</p>
<p>To make it to a module, you should create a <code>__init__.py</code> file in the same directory.</p>
<p>ps: for others who can't see <code>Run Test | Debug Test</code> code lens above the test, which means you can't make the <code>unittest</code> discover the single file as a test file.<br/>
Check the <code>-p</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#cmdoption-unittest-discover-p" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pattern</a> maybe the right move.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do the method names all begin with <code>test</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I copied the tests from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">unittest Basic Example</a> exactly to work with while setting this up.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you using VS Code <code>.1.21.1</code> or <code>1.12.1</code> like you typed? And you can try removing the test settings from your <code>.vscode/settings.json</code> and run the <code>Run All Unit Tests</code> command which will guide you through setting things up.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have a <code>__init__.py</code> in the test dir? If not, the <code>unittest</code> won't consider it as a test module then, would discover it.</span>
