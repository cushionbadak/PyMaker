<p>Using while loops in Python, I have been asked to complete this task for university but I cannot seem to figure out how to do it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ask for a number, and if the response is actually NOT a number (e.g. "cow", "six", "8!") then throw it out and ask for an actual number. When you do get a number, return it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If anyone could show me how to do this that would be great!</p>
<p>I started out with this, although I'm not sure if it is the right starting point:</p>
<pre><code>while () #not sure what to put in here
    number_a = input("Enter an actual number:")
    number_b = int(num_string)
return (
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what to type after the <code>while</code> to make it work for numbers not words.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using try/except construction:</p>
<pre><code>inp = "" 
print('Type a number') 
while 1:
    inp = input()
    try:
        int(inp)
        break
    except TypeError:
        print('Try again') 
        continue
print('Your number is', int(inp)) 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>stop = False
while (stop == False):
    x = input("Enter an actual number: ")
    try:
        print(int(x))
        stop = True
    except Exception:
        continue
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You must know how to do <i>most</i> of this? How to do something repeatedly, how to ask for <code>input</code>, how to <code>try</code> to convert that to an <code>int</code>, how to <code>return</code> a value? Write the parts you do know, and point to the part you don't know, and we can help you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The code you added is a good start.  The function <code>input()</code> returns a string.  So your variable <code>number_a</code> will be a string.  Using the <code>int()</code> function to convert it to an integer is the right way to go but it will raise an error if <code>number_a</code> is not convertible into an integer.  So you need a way to handle that error and ask the user to re-enter the number if it occurs.  For this, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>try</code> and <code>except</code> statements</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bill I clicked approve on your edit, but looking at it again, I think you wanted to keep (and reformat) the second version of the code, not the first one—it has the <code>while</code> and the <code>return</code>, and a valid comment about the missing part instead of a stray SyntaxError. (And now it won't let me re-edit until your edit is approved or rejected.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert Fixed the edit mess for you ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">(1) To loop forever, you can use <code>while True:</code> (No parentheses, but you d need a colon.) That means you'll need a <code>break</code> or <code>return</code> indented inside the loop, or it really will loop forever. (2) You call <code>int(num_string)</code>, that means you have to have to have a <code>num_string</code>—but the only thing you have is <code>number_a</code>. You'll need to rename something. (3) What happens if the string is <code>"cow"</code>? Try <code>int("cow")</code> in the interactive interpreter and see what happens. Do you get an exception? Then you need to use <code>try:</code> and <code>except (that error type):</code> around the <code>int</code> call.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you just copy and paste the other answer with irrelevant minor changes? Because it does the exact same thing, and has the exact same problems.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry, how do I delete it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right underneath the answer, you should see links "share edit delete flag". Some of them may be greyed out because your rep is too low, but I think you should be able to click delete on your own answers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm on my mobile and I have only edit share and flag</span>
