<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to write a simple program in python to read command line arguments and print a final word based on the arguments. If there is any argument of the form "-f=" then the  will go to the front of the final printed word. Similarly for "-e=" the text goes to the back and if there is -caps as an argument then the final printed word will all be uppercase. I do a while loop to scan through the arguments and check for these flags. The full code is:</p>
<pre><code>import sys 
i=1
while i&lt;len(sys.argv):
    frnt_wrd = None
    lst_wrd = None 
    arg_1 = str(sys.argv[i])
    if arg_1.startswith('-f='):
        front = arg_1.split('=')
        frnt_wrd = front[1]

    elif arg_1.startswith('-e='):
        last = arg_1.split('=')
        lst_wrd = last[1]

    if arg_1.startswith('-caps'):
        caps = True

    else:
        word = arg_1
    i+=1
print (front)
print (frnt_wrd)
</code></pre>
<p>I had a couple of if statements later on to print out the word based on whether frnt_wrd and lst_wrd were not equal to None (i.e. a value had been assigned to them) but nothing was printing out. To check the problem I did:</p>
<pre><code>print (front)
print (frnt_wrd)
</code></pre>
<p>and the output actually gives me front as the desired array (when there is an argument of the form "-f=" but returns frnt_wrd as None even though I defined:</p>
<pre><code>frnt_wrd = front[1] 
</code></pre>
<p>When I type exactly this line outside of the while loop it actually works but why is it not defining the frnt_wrd inside the while loop? </p>
<p>Edit: The full code giving me frnt_wrd as None is above. What else do you need?
I would like to learn how to do it with while and without argparse. I need to understand why I am defining a variable and it is not defining.</p>

<p>The problem is that you reset <code>frnt_word</code> and <code>lst_word</code> to <code>None</code> each time through the loop, so you're overwriting the value that was set by a previous argument. You should just initialize them <em>before</em> the loop.</p>
<pre><code>frnt_word = None
lst_word = None
caps = False
word = None
for arg in sys.argv[1:]:
    optarr = arg.split("=")
    if optarr[0] == "-f":
        frnt_word = optarr[1]
    elif optarr[0] == "-e":
        lst_word = optarr[1]
    elif optarr[0] == "-caps":
        caps = True
    else:
        word = arg
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>i += 1</code> needs to be indented so it's part of the loop. Why don't you just use <code>for arg in sys.argv[1:]:</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"Edit: The full code giving me frnt_wrd as None is above. What else do you need?" The full traceback, as I asked for. i.e. all of the lines that get spat out when you hit an error</span>
