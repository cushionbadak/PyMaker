<p>I have a list that I want to break into three separate lists created from the first, second, and third positions in the list. It would look something like this:</p>
<p>input:</p>
<pre><code>X = ['GCA','GCC','GCT','GCG']
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>C1 = ['G', 'G', 'G', 'G']
C2 = ['C', 'C', 'C', 'C']
C3 = ['A', 'C', 'T', 'G']
</code></pre>
<p>I was thinking about using list comprehension. Doing something like:</p>
<pre><code>C1 = [p for p in X if X[0][0]]
</code></pre>
<p>But I don't know how to slice a string that is inside a list. </p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>@Chris_Rands answer using <code>zip()</code> is better, but since you also asked about list comprehension: </p>
<p><code>C1=[s[0] for s in X]</code></p>
<p>works.</p>
<p><code>[[s[n] for s in X] for n in range(3))]</code> would get you all of them as a list.</p>
<p>Output: <code>[['G', 'G', 'G', 'G'], ['C', 'C', 'C', 'C'], ['A', 'C', 'T', 'G']]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For your attempt of using comprehension, you just need code like</p>
<pre><code>C1 = [p[0] for p in X]
C2 = [p[1] for p in X]
C3 = [p[2] for p in X]
</code></pre>
<p>or use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zip()</a>:</p>
<pre><code>C1, C2, C3 = zip(*X)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you want to break up your codons like this anyway? This is clearly DNA</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Chris_Rands This is an answer, not a comment ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, that helps. @Chris_Rands I am working on a script to give me expanded codons based on amino acid data. I need lists of codons based on position to then compare to a dictionary of expanded codons. Also thanks Zinki, that helps too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you might have got the <code>zip()</code> idea from <i>someone</i> else, originally you said this wasn't possible ;)</span>
