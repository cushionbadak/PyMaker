<p>I'm trying to develop a simple program that finds decimal numbers that are equal to the average of their digits.  Example 4.5 (4+5=9 / 2)= 4.5  </p>
<p>In order to do this I need to take averages that have several decimal points and compare them to a big iterated list of decimal numbers (I'm using a nested loop to do this). </p>
<p>When I use the Decimal library to do simple division, the answer comes out with four decimal points, like I want: 0.2727</p>
<p>But when I try to print the  the averages of my loop. <strong>(Decimal(i + y + z + q)) / Decimal(4))</strong> the averages only come out to the hundredth decimal point <strong>(0.25
0.5
0.75, etc)</strong>.  Why?  I've tried converting into str() and int() before passing into Decimal() and it doesn't work.  </p>
<pre><code>from decimal import *
getcontext().prec = 4

print(Decimal(3)/Decimal(9))


numbers1to10 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

for i in numbers1to10:
    for y in numbers1to10:
        for z in numbers1to10:
            for q in numbers1to10:
                if: (Decimal(i + y + z + q)) / Decimal(4)) == ((Decimal(i))+ (Decimal(y)/10) + (Decimal(z)/100)+ (Decimal(q)/1000)):
                    print (((Decimal(i))+ (Decimal(y)/10) + (Decimal(z)/100) + (Decimal(q)/1000)))

<p>Can't say for sure, but those numbers (0.25 0.5 0.75) look quite "round" to me, by that I mean that they are just 1/4, 2/4 and 3/4 and they don't have any other decimals to show. Then it's normal that you only get to the hundredth. 0.5 is 0.5, no need to show 0.5000.</p>
<p>If you really want to show to 4 decimals with additional zeroes at the end, use the format functions.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>print("%.4f" % 0.5)
</code></pre>
<p>Displays <code>0.5000</code>.</p>
