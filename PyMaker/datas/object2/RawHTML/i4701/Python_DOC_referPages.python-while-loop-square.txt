<p>I am a beginner at Python and I'm trying to use a <code>while loop</code> to sum up all of the squared <code>n</code> values in a given <code>n</code> value range.</p>
<p>Code: </p>
<pre><code>def problem2(n):
    x = 0
    y = 0
    while x &lt; n:
        y = (n**2)+y
        x+=1
    return y
</code></pre>
<p>For some reason, this equation returns the input number cubed.</p>
<p>Can someone explain why this happens and how to fix it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to perform the <code>**</code> on <code>x</code>, the value that is being incremented:</p>
<pre><code>def problem2(n):
  x = 0
  count = 0
  while x &lt; n:
    count += pow(x, 2)
    x += 1
  return count
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You keep squaring the same number <code>n</code>, instead of the one being incremented <code>x</code>.</p>
<pre><code>def sum_of_squares(n):
    sum = 0
    for x in range(0, n):
        sum += x*x
    return sum
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You also don't really need the <code>while</code> loop, avoiding having to manually keep track of which variable is the counting variable and which one is the result variable (which is what you are confusing, as explained e.g. by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/7326738/ajax1234">@Ajax1234</a> in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49352315/4042267">their answer</a>).</p>
<p>It is a lot more Pythonic to use the built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code></a>, a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators" rel="nofollow noreferrer">generator expression</a> and <code>range</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def problem2(n):
    return sum(x**2 for x in range(n))
</code></pre>
<p>This would be a lot more readable and better (unless of course you are being <em>forced</em> to use <code>while</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Looks good. You're almost there. </p>
<p>It makes it the cube root because you add y to <code>(n**2)</code> everytime. Because you code runs until <code>x !&lt; n</code> it runs n times. That means that you add <code>n**2</code> to <code>n**2*n</code>. </p>
<p>That means that it gives <code>1(n**2)*(n-1)(n**2)</code> which equals <code>n(n**2) = n**3</code></p>
<p>Hope this was clear enough. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">This should be a comment as it doesn't answer the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IliaCholy It fixes the problem by not using a <code>while</code> loop (fixing the problem being one part of the question). As to the why, the answer by Ajax and your own already sufficiently explain that so I did not want to repeat it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think this is great for both solving the original problem <i>and</i> coming up with your own solution</span>
