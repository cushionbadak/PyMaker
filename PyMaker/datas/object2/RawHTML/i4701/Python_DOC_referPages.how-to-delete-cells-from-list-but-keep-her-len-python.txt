<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to delete all the same cells but because of changes in my list the length is changing as well so instead of 9 loops it makes 5. </p>
<p>For the input: </p>
<p><code>apple,banana,coconut,apple,banana,coconut,apple,banana,coconut(str)</code></p>
<p>I expect the output: </p>
<p><code>apple, banana, coconut (list)</code></p>
<p>but I got: </p>
<p><code>banana, apple, banana, coconut</code></p>
<p>I tried to make another list so it won't change the original list length but as you can understand it hasn't helped.</p>
<p>Can you help, please?</p>
<p>P.S I made the string to a list(list_of_products)</p>
<pre><code>just_a_list = list_of_products
for product in just_a_list:
    if list_of_products.count(product) &gt; 1:
        list_of_products.remove(product)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>set</code></a>, which by definition, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an unordered collection with no duplicate elements</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>x = ['apple','banana','coconut','apple','banana','coconut','apple','banana','coconut']
print(set(x))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>{'apple', 'coconut', 'banana'}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want it as a list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; unique = list(set(x))
['coconut', 'apple', 'banana']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The easiest way to achieve this is simply converting the list to a set and then to a list again.</p>
<pre><code>list_of_products = ["apple", "banana", "coconut", "apple", "banana", "coconut", "apple", "banana", "coconut"]
products = list(set(list_of_products))
# products = ['coconut', 'apple', 'banana']
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok thank you so just for the protocol set means to make the list with any duplication?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CaptainPython as long as the list contains hashable elements, yes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">wait but if want to use that list for any other uses it ain't working.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have to assign it to a variable to use it. so <code>use_this = list(set(list_of_products))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean i want to print that list so it prints me the original even thought i made x = set(x)</span>
