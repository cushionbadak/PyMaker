<p>I have the code below:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
import pandas as pd
matrix = pd.read_table('testGEM.txt')
ID = pd.read_table('test_transcripts.txt', header = None)
ls = ID.values.tolist()
list=[]
for sublist in id:
    for item in sublist:
        list.append(item)
id = tuple(list)
x = matrix[matrix.index.isin(id)]
x.to_csv('test10.out',sep='\t')
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I run the code, I got a problem saying:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
File "map.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
for sublist in id:
TypeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object is not iterable
</code></pre>
<p>Does anyone have any idea where is the problem?</p>

<p>In python, <code>id</code> is a built in function described below. You probably wanted to iterate over <code>ID</code> in your case instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you expect <code>id</code> to represent in this code? There was a comment (that for some reason was deleted) that suggested you might have intended it to be <code>ID</code> instead. <code>id</code>, lowercase, is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">builtin function</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay! I see. Thank you for the clarification!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! It makes sense to me.</span>
