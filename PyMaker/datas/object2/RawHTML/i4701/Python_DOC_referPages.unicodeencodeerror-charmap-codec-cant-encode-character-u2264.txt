<li>I'm using python3.6 in windows7 and django 1.9</li>
<li>I got this error when i run my code.</li>
<li>In my code i'm parsing xml data to write a html page. </li>
<li>I got that some character is unable to encode properly thats why its throwing an error.</li>
<li><code>\u2264</code> this is the character(less than or equal) which is the root cause of the error.</li>
<li>My question is how to encode this properly in python3</li>
</ul>
<p>Detailed Error Log:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Dev\EXE\TEMP\cookie\crumbs\views.py", line 1520, in parser
    html_file.write(html_text)
  File "C:\Users\Cookie1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\lib\encodings\cp1252.py", line 19, in encode
    return codecs.charmap_encode(input,self.errors,encoding_table)[0]
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2264' in position 389078: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;

<p>The error message indicates that you're trying to encode to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Windows-1252</a> character encoding. That encoding doesn't have a representation of the less than or equal symbol.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "\u2264".encode("cp1252")
&gt;&gt;&gt; Traceback... [as above]
</code></pre>
<p>The answer is to use UTF-8, an unrestricted encoding, instead of Windows-1252, a very restricted encoding. </p>
<p>Your question doesn't include much context, but the line <code>html_file.write(html_text)</code> makes me think you're using Python's file protocol. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation for <code>open()</code></a> shows how to set the encoding, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>html_file = open("file.html", mode="w", encoding="utf8")
</code></pre>
<p>Note that "the default encoding is platform dependent (whatever <code>locale.getpreferredencoding()</code> returns)", which is why you're getting Windows-1252 on Windows 7.</p>
