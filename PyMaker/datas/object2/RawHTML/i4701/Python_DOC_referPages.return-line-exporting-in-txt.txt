<p>I try to generate 300k urls with python in a text file: </p>
<pre><code>with open(r'somefile.txt') as f_out:
for i in range(100, 120):
f_out.write(r'www.website.com/{}\n'.format(i))
</code></pre>
<p>But the result is:</p>
<pre><code>www.website.com/
101www.websitecom/
102www.website.com/
</code></pre>
<p>etc</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From what I can tell, you want to output the URL's like this:</p>
<pre><code>www.website.com/100
www.website.com/101
www.website.com/102
</code></pre>
<p>The solution I came up with based on the code you provided was to use the <code>print()</code> function with the <code>file</code> argument (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Documentation of the <code>file</code> argument</a>)</p>
<pre><code>with open(r'somefile.txt', "w") as f_out:
    for i in range(100, 120):
        print(r'www.website.com/{}'.format(i), file=f_out)
</code></pre>
<p>You might also want to read about opening files in <code>write</code> mode <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=open#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I put  the data into a variable first.. it prints and saves no problem..</p>
<pre><code>with open('somefile.txt', 'a') as f_out:
    for i in range(100, 120):
        data = 'www.website.com/{}\n'.format(i)
        print(data)
        f_out.write(data)

<span class="comment-copy">Wtf ? yes i got a 'w' after 'somefile.txt') but that wasn't relevant in this example, just asking about the "blackslash n "</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@johnashu yes it is, the "\n" doesn't work in open i may use print but i can figure it how.  People, stop trolling or just bulling you are useless as f.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">We can't help you figure out what's wrong with your code if we can't reproduce the problem. So yes, until you provide a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>, we're pretty useless. The code you posted does <i>not</i> produce such a file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Lol @Aran-Fey everybody get the good result except you. Retry.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no problem. just try to make sure you have plenty of detail in the question. people might come across wrong but everyone here genuinely just wants to solve the problem! please select a correct answer using the green tick so future users can quickly find a correct answer! :)</span>
