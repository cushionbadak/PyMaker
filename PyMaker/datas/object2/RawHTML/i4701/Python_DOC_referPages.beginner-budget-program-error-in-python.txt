<p>I am in the process of creating a basic budget program in Python 3. </p>
<p>It needs to create a series of three people and give them a salary, 2 expenses, and their left over cash at the end of the week. You will also be comparing their left over expenses to an amount of money they need to save every week. I believe I have it all finished except for this problem whenever I run the program, I get the following message:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/----/Desktop/BudgetProgramTest.py", line 42, in 
    personOneLeftOver = personOneSalary - personOneExpenses
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'tuple'
</code></pre>
<p>How can I solve this error? What would be the correct way to code this? It would be easier to understand with the original code for my program:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;prev&gt;

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are some errors on your code.</p>
<p>1 -  <code>input</code> always return a string, therefore all the places which you need a number you must update to  <code>int(input(...))</code>;
Eg:</p>
<pre><code>personTwoGas = int(input("How much do you spend on gas per week?"))
</code></pre>
<p>2 - Whenever you sum a tuple or a list, you must use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum()</code></a>.
Eg:</p>
<pre><code>personOneLeftOver = float(personOneSalary) - sum(personOneExpenses)
</code></pre>
<p><em>Most likely there are more errors, just pointed those which might stop you from developing this task.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>personOneLeftOver = float(personOneSalary) - sum(personOneExpenses)
</code></pre>
<p>You have defined the expenses as a tuple.  You can all of the values in the tuple together with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum()</code></a>.</p>
