<p>This is a topic that I have not been able to find a straight answer for. Python's website (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html</a>) says that it is included from 3.4, but pip's website (<a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/</a>) says that is isn't included from python 3.4. Some youtube videos are telling me that it isn't already installed. Some questions on this page are telling me that it is. 
So, is it?</p>

<p>yes , python 3.6 already comes with pip .</p>
<p>You can check using <code>pip --version</code> in command prompt to check the version of pip installed . </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Depends on your Python distribution, I guess. On Debian, both ship separately.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On which OS? Anyway, I installed it on Windows and yes, unless you go and change the custom installation and exclude pip (uncheck it) by yourself, you will have pip installed when you install Python 3.6.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What part of the pip website makes you think it's not included with 3.4+?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is on windows 10.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">pip is already installed if you're using Python 2 &gt;=2.7.9 or Python 3 &gt;=3.4 binaries downloaded</span>
