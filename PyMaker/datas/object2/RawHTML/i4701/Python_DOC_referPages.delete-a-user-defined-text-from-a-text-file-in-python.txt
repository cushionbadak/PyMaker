<p>Assuming that:</p>
<ul>
<li>you want the user to supply just the name, and not the full 'name:number' pair</li>
<li>your phonebook stores one name:number pair per line </li>
</ul>
<p>I'd do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import os
from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile


def delete_contact():
    contact_name = input('Choose name to delete: ')
    # You probably want to pass path in as an argument
    path = 'phonebook1.txt'
    base_dir = os.path.dirname(path)
    with open(path) as phonebook, \
            NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+', dir=base_dir, delete=False) as tmp:
        for line in phonebook:
            # rsplit instead of split supports names containing ':'
            # if numbers can also contain ':' you need something smarter
            name, number = line.rsplit(':', 1)
            if name != contact_name:
                tmp.write(line)
        os.replace(tmp.name, path)
</code></pre>
<p>Using a tempfile like this means that if something goes wrong while processing the file you aren't left with a half-written phonebook, you'll still have the original file unchanged. You're also not reading the entire file into memory with this approach.</p>
<p><code>os.replace()</code> is Python 3.3+ only, if you're using something older you can use <code>os.rename()</code> as long as you're not using Windows.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here's the tempfile documentation</a>. In this case, you can think of <code>NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+', dir=base_dir, delete=False)</code> as something like <code>open('tmpfile.txt', mode='w+')</code>. NamedTemporaryFile saves you from having to find a unique name for your tempfile (so that you don't overwrite an existing file). The <code>dir</code> argument creates the tempfile in the same directory as <code>phonebook1.txt</code> which is a good idea because <code>os.replace()</code> can fail when operating across two different filesystems. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Use proper indentation please</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your to_delete variable is a list of chars. I'm going to assume that you are not going to be deleting a line from a phonebook based on if a letter matches a line from the phonebook.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, but  your code does the same thing mine was doing.  compling with no errror  but not deleting the line or rewriting the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you post the content of phonebook1.txt?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And the user input?</span>
