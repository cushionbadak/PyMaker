<p>I was working in phyton and came across this name glob, 
                     googled it and 
   couldn't find any answer, what does glob do, why is it used for</p>

<p>"The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern(...)"</p>
<p>i skip the imports <code>import glob2</code> and

<p>get all the filenames in the directory where filename is any and it is extension is text</p>
<pre><code>filenames = glob2.glob("*.txt")

<span class="comment-copy">if it works, it scans all text files from curent dir and concatenate their contents on a big, dated file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you ask me, the flaw is that running this program again uses the output from prior execution since the extension &amp; dir are the same for input &amp; output</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/glob2" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>glob2</code></a> is an external library.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am new to python i really dont have any idea about glob2,     filenames = glob2.glob("*.txt") what does the above code does..  can someone explain this line by line...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hmmm... I see someone is doing the python mega course.  ;)</span>
