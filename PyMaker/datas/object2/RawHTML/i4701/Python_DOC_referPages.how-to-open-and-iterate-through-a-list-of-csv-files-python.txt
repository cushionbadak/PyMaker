<p>I have a list of pathnames to CSV files. I need to open each CSV file, take the data without the header and then merge it all together into a new CSV file.</p>
<p>I have this code which gets me the list of CSV file pathnames:</p>
<pre><code>file_list = []
for folder_name, sub_folders, file_names in os.walk(wd):
    for file_name in file_names:
        file_extention = folder_name + '\\' + file_name
        if file_name.endswith('csv'):
            file_list.append(file_extention)
</code></pre>
<p>An example of my list is:</p>
<pre><code>['C:\\Users\\Documents\\GPS_data\\West_coast\\Westland\\GPS_data1.csv',
 'C:\\Users\\Documents\\GPS_data\\West_coast\\Westland\\GPS_data2.csv',
 'C:\\Users\\Documents\\GPS_data\\West_coast\\Westland\\GPS_data3.csv']
</code></pre>
<p>I am struggling to figure out what to do, any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>The main idea is to read in each line of a file, and write it to the new file. But remember to skip the first line that has the column headers in it.  I previously recommend the cvs module, however it doesn't seem like that is necessary, since this task does not require analyzing the data.</p>
<pre><code>file_list = ['data1.csv','data2.csv']

with open('new.csv', 'w') as newfile:  # create a new file
    for filename in filelist:
        with open(filename) as csvfile:
            next(csvfile)   # skip the header row
            for row in csvfile:
                newfile.write(line) # write to the new csv file
</code></pre>
<p>Edit: clarified my answer.</p>
