<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to be able to check if a JSON array has a piece of data that meets criteria. I am learning Python and JSONs are somewhat new to me.
This is what I have so far... The idea is that as long as the 'contact_count' &lt; 0 or == to 0 in this case that it wound recursively run that function until its false</p>
<pre><code>def instantMessage():
    data = json.loads(jSon)
    while data[1]['contact_count'] == 0:
        instantMessage()


jSon = {u'contact_list': [], u'contact_count': 0}
</code></pre>
<p>I appreciate your help ahead of time!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Note that if your JSON object is not changing, this will result in an infinite loop:</p>
<pre><code>def instantMessage():
    data = json.loads(jSon)
    while data.get('contact_count') == 0:
        instantMessage()
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What is your JSON structure? What's stored in <code>jSon</code> is a Python dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To be honest I'm not sure I'm kinda nieve here :/ I might know what to look for if you point me in the right direction</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JC Really, you haven't provided enough information to go on so it's hard to know how to help. It would help if you could provide a sample input (a JSON array), and what you expect the results to be. The beginning of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">json</a> module documentation shows some examples of using JSON in Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>jSon</code> isn't a JSON, it is a <code>dict</code>.</span>
