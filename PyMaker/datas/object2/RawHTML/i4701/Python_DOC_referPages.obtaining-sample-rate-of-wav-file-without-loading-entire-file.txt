<p>I have a <code>.wav</code> file on my disk somewhere. Such a file consists (basically) of a sampling rate together with a wave form given as a long sequence of numbers. Typical Python libraries for loading <code>.wav</code> files will give both the sampling rate and the data: for example, there is <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.io.wavfile.read.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>scipy.io.wavfile.read</code></a> or <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wavio" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>wavio.read</code></a>.</p>
<p>Because the <code>.wav</code> files might be large and loading them might take a long time, and sometimes I might be interested in their sampling rate before wanting to have access to the waveform, I am looking for a fast way to extract the sampling rate from the <code>.wav</code> file in Python -- one that does not require reading the entire file.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>wave</code></a> package from the standard library:</p>
<pre><code>import wave

file = ...
with wave.open(file, 'rb') as f:
    framerate = f.getframerate()
</code></pre>
