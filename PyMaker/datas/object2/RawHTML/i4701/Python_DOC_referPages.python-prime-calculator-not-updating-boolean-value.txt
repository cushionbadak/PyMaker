<p>Hello guys, I've just started to code and this is probably a really simple question. I want my code to either find the factors of a number or print if a number is a prime - but my boolean value in the "prime" function never updates to False. Not sure why!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The reason why your <code>prime()</code> function is not 'updating' to <code>False</code> is because there is no <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#return" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>return</code></a> statement in the function.</p>
<p>With it, the function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>def prime():
  checker = True
  for i in range(2,num):
      if num % i == 0:
          print(f"{num} can be divisible by {i}.")
          checker = False
  return checker
</code></pre>
<p>And the updated code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>from sys import argv

def prime():
  checker = True
  for i in range(2,num):
      if num % i == 0:
          print(f"{num} can be divisible by {i}.")
          checker = False
  return checker


num = int(input("Enter the number you want to check is prime: "))

if num &lt; 2:
    print(f"{num} is a prime number.")
elif num == 0:
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")
elif num &gt; 0:
    is_prime = prime()
    print(f"Is this number a prime - {is_prime}.")
else:
    print(f"Please write number larger than 0.")
</code></pre>
<p>However, this isn't the only way to solve your problem: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19158339/why-are-global-variables-evil#19158418">it's not recommended and frowned upon by many programmers as bad practice</a> - use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>global</code></a> statement (which looks like that's what you were trying to do originally).</p>
<p>With it, the function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>def prime():
  global checker
  for i in range(2,num):
      if num % i == 0:
          print(f"{num} can be divisible by {i}.")
          checker = False
</code></pre>
<p>And the updated code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>from sys import argv

def prime():
  global checker
  for i in range(2,num):
      if num % i == 0:
          print(f"{num} can be divisible by {i}.")
          checker = False


num = int(input("Enter the number you want to check is prime: "))
checker = True

if num &lt; 2:
    print(f"{num} is a prime number.")
elif num == 0:
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")
elif num &gt; 0:
    prime()
    print(f"Is this number a prime - {checker}.")
else:
    print(f"Please write number larger than 0.")

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def prime():
       global checker
       """ remaining logic as is"""
</code></pre>
<p>I think this would work.
   Sorry for format as I'm writing on phone.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you get any errors when you run this code, or does it print out <code>True</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No errors, it just prints out True even if it's not a prime.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Write 'global checker' inside 'def prime' function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No worries - always happy to help!</span>
