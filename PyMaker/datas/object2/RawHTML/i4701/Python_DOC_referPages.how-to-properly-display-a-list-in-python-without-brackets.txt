<p>currently I am using </p>
<pre><code>for s in list:
     print(*s)

<p>but it displays the list output as </p>

['the output']

<p>But I would like the output to be displayed as </p>
<pre><code>this is
the output

<p>There should be a simple solution but i am still yet to come across one.</p>

<p>Join using the newline character:</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>" ".join(list)</code>. Assuming your list is 1D and you don't want commas.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is your input list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't call a variable like a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>built-in function</code></a>, you make those functions inaccessible for other parts of your program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KentonTurner: Did any of the solution worked for you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print(*sublist, sep = "\n")</code> is more flexible, because it also works with more than one sublist element.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If OP want to get the string and want to use somewhere. print might be just for debug.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>join</code> is a string, not a list function. And if the OP makes a mistake like calling their variable <code>list</code>, you should point out this mistake, not repeat it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for pointing out my mistake, MrT!</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>join</code> still won't work, it expects strings, not lists. I suggested testing code before posting.</span>
