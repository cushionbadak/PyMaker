<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I wrote a program using many functions (<code>def name():</code>).
These function are summed at the end of code like:</p>
<p><code>a()+b()+c()+d()+e()</code>
In what way I can do this:</p>
<p><code>program:</code> &gt;&gt;&gt;a,b,c,d,e are optional fuctions, which one of these functions you want to use in the calculation?</p>
<p><code>user:</code> &gt;&gt;&gt;a,b,d</p>
<p>and the program just bring those chosen functions in program.</p>
<p>I did search a lot but I could not find sth like this.
Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>You could use a dictionary in the following way. </p>
<pre><code>def a():
    return 2 + 3

def b():
    return 3 - 2

def c():
    return 2*3

def d():
    return 2/3

dic = {}
dic['a'] = a
dic['b'] = b
dic['c'] = c
dic['d'] = d

funcs = str(raw_input("which functions would you like to use?: "))
funcs = funcs.split(',')

result = 0

for i in funcs:
    result += dic[i]()

print result
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use getattr() to get the functions:</p>
<pre><code>import sys

def a():
    return 1

def b():
    return 2

def c():
    return 3

sum = 0

# Assume user input of 'a' &amp; 'c'
for name in ['a', 'c']:
    #
    # Get the function and call it...
    #
    sum += getattr(sys.modules[__name__], name)()

print('sum: {}'.format(sum))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Look into dictionaries or map your function names to indices in a Python list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@synchronizer I don not know how.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">thank you, But what about avoiding for loop. the program after this for loop will continue to use <code>result</code> in different situation. Any way is there any other thing to use it instead of for loop?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This code evaluates functions only once, making the code not really useful. Also it evaluates functions user did not select.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zerocool In my undestanding <i>code</i> is a block of lines we are talking about.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zerocool I came too late, your answer was accepted. My suggestion is <code>dic['a'] = a</code> etc. (save the function, not the result) and <code>result += dic[i]()</code> (call when needed the result).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zerocool Don't worry about that. Enjoy SO.</span>
