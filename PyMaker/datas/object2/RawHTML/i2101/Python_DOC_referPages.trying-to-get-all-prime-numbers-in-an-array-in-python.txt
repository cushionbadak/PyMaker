<p>I am trying to print out all prime numbers that are in an array called 'checkMe'. But I just can't get it to work. I've succesfully made a program that checks it for one number but it doesn't work for an array. If anyone knows what is wrong on please tell me. BTW: I am a big noob in python so it probably isn't the most beautiful code. </p>
<pre><code>checkMe = range(1, 100)

dividers = []
primes = []

for y in checkMe:
    x = y
    for x in range(2, x):
        if (y/x).is_integer():
            dividers.append(x)
    if len(dividers) &lt; 2:
        primes.append(y)

print("\n"+str(checkMe)+" has "+str(len(primes))+" primes")
print(primes)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>range(1, 100) has 5 primes
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>
<p>Expected Output:</p>
<pre><code>range(1, 100) has 25 primes
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83,
89, 97]

<p>The logic is correct but you don't reset your divider array.
Also you should ignore the number 1 and the number of divider should be less than 1.</p>
<p>this should work</p>
<pre><code>checkMe = range(1, 100)
primes = []
for y in checkMe[1:]:
    x = y
    dividers = []
    for x in range(2, x):
        if (y/x).is_integer():
            dividers.append(x)
    if len(dividers) &lt; 1:
        primes.append(y)
print("\n"+str(checkMe)+" has "+str(len(primes))+" primes")
print(primes)
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helped you, bye</p>

<p>I dont want to burst your bubble but if you were to have done some quick googling you could have found an answer.</p>
<p>Anyways the solution to your problem is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>checkMe = range(1, 100)

dividers = []
primes = []

for num in range(1,100):
    prime = True
    for i in range(2,num):
        if (num%i==0):
            prime = False
            dividers.append(num)
    if prime:
        primes.append(num)

print("\n"+ str(checkMe)+ "has "+str(len(primes))+" primes")
print(primes)
</code></pre>

<p>Please read the python docs there is a lot in there <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html</a></p>
<pre><code>check_me = range(2, 100)

primes = []
for i in check_me:
    for j in range(2, i):
        if not i % j:
            break
    else:
        primes.append(i)

print(f'{check_me} as {len(primes)} primes\n', *primes)
# range(2, 100) as 25 primes
# 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97

<span class="comment-copy">Change this line in your code, <code>for x1 in range(2, x): if (y/x1).is_integer():</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think it is a reasonable criticism to say that they could have found the solution by googling. Algorithms are hard to learn and we are here to help.</span>
