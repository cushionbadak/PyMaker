<p>I'm trying to understand OS concepts and Python libraries.</p>
<p>I came across a specific example mentioned in Python documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html</a> link which is not working for me on Windows.</p>
<pre><code>import signal, os

def handler(signum, frame):
    print('Signal handler called with signal', signum)
    raise OSError("Couldn't open device!")

# Set the signal handler and a 5-second alarm
signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, handler)
signal.alarm(5)
# This open() may hang indefinitely
fd = os.open('/dev/ttyS0', os.O_RDWR)

signal.alarm(0)          # Disable the alarm
</code></pre>
<p>Is there any specific reason why singal.SIGALRM is not working on windows?</p>
<p>Auto complete is even showing the SIGALRM in Pycharm IDE (I'm assuming that there will be a variable or function if it shows like that). </p>
<p>But when I run the program, it is giving me the below error on Windows. I haven't checked this on Linux.</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/preddy53/Desktop/syst.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, handler)
AttributeError: module 'signal' has no attribute 'SIGALRM'
</code></pre>
<p>Where am I doing wrong? Is it specific to operating system only?</p>

<p>Yes, Windows OS <em>doesn't implement that signal</em>. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#example" rel="nofollow noreferrer">example you found</a> starts with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is a minimal example program. It uses the <code>alarm()</code> function to limit the time spent waiting to open a file; <em>[...]</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signal.alarm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>signal.alarm()</code> function</a> is documented as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Availability: Unix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, the <code>SIG*</code> section elsewhere on the module documentation page states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that not all systems define the same set of signal names; only those names defined by the system are defined by this module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So <code>SIGALRM</code> is not available on Windows so you get an attribute error instead.</p>
<p>Note that Windows also does not have a <code>/dev</code> virtual filesystem, so the <code>os.open('/dev/ttyS0', os.O_RDWR)</code> call would fail too.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8420422/python-windows-equivalent-of-sigalrm">python: windows equivalent of SIGALRM</a> for an alternative using threads.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Because Windows doesn't have such a signal.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As it will not have <code>/dev/ttyS0</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok. So, is there alternative for SIGALRM which could do more or less the same thing in Windows?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Anudeep: I already linked to a post that talks about an alternative.</span>
