<p>I am learning about classes and wanted to find out how python keeps track of what the type of an object is. I would imagine, that it is easy to tell what the type of an int is because it is a built in type </p>
<pre><code>but now suppose, I have the following code: 
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x,y):
        self._x=x
        self._y=y

    def draw(self):
        print(self._x, self._y)
p1=Point(1,2)
</code></pre>
<p>How does python know that this object is of type p. I understand, that if I wanted to know the type of p1, I would call <code>type(p1)</code>, but I was wondering how the type is represented in memory. I thought that it is an attribute inherited from the <code>object</code> class that gets set when I call the constructor, but when I call <code>print(object.__dict__)</code>, there is no type attribute. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I don't want to confuse you with metaclasses yet, so I'll be giving a brief explanation. The <code>__class__</code> attribute of an object returns the class of that instance, which you are referring "type" here.</p>
<pre><code>p1.__class__
</code></pre>
<p>returns this.</p>
<pre><code>__main__.Point
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>__main__</code> is the module and <code>Point</code> is the class obviously.</p>
<p>However there is more than this. Classes are also objects and when you call</p>
<pre><code>Point.__class__
</code></pre>
<p>It returns <code>type</code>, and <code>type</code> is a metaclass in Python. Basically the class of a class is type.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Builit-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dir</a> will give you list of valid attributes for that object.</p>
<p>Your example:</p>
<pre><code>class Point:
    def __init__(self, x,y):
        self._x=x
        self._y=y

    def draw(self):
        print(self._x, self._y)
p1=Point(1,2)
</code></pre>
<p>Then</p>
<pre><code>print(dir(p1))
['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', '_x', '_y', 'draw']
</code></pre>
