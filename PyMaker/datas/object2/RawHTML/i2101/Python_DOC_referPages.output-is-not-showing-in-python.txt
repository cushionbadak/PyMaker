<p>I am python 3.7 on my window 10 and having problem with code. I have created a test.py file and running following code in that file :- </p>
<pre><code> person = {'name': 'Jemm', 'age': '23'}
 sentence = 'My name is ' + person['name'] + 'and i am' + person['age'] + 'years old.'

print(sentence)
</code></pre>
<p>and when i print <code>import test</code> then output is not showing blank(no output).</p>
<p>Edit:  when i print hello world then output is showing. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import test
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(test)
&lt;module 'test' from '/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/test/__init__.py'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>There is a <code>test</code> module in Python itself. Be sure you are running your module. You must be in the same directory as your file <code>test.py</code> to import your file instead of the Python one.</p>
<p>Update: Python uses a search path list mechanism for finding modules when importing. The "current working directory" is usually at the first place in this list (the empty string). See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>PYTHONPATH</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sys.path</code></a>.</p>
<p>You can add your own path(s) into <code>PYTHONPATH</code> (in shell/command line) or <code>sys.path</code> (in Python).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I guess the problem is that you didn't save the file after you did all the code in <code>test.py</code>, what happens if save it then run <code>import test</code> somewhere else, that's what i think</p>
<p>Also as Messa said, "There is a test module in Python itself. Be sure you are running your module. You must be in the same directory as your file test.py to import your file instead of the Python one." that's also useful information, have to be same directory as <code>test.py</code> (your file)</p>
<p>If you're not in the same directory, do:</p>
<pre><code>__import__('whole filepath')
</code></pre>
<p>For it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">From a fresh interpreter? Have you checked that <code>print(test.__file__)</code> is printing your file + 'c'?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I changed name of test.py to other name and now output is showing. But there is no space in output. <code>My name is Jemmand i amJemmyear old</code>  please let me know how to add space between <code>Jemmand</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Imtango30 Because you don't have spaces in the string :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try  <code>sentence = 'My name is ' + person['name'] + ' and i am ' + person['age'] + ' years old.'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or if you are on Python 3.6 or 3,7:  <code>sentence = f'My name is {person['name']} and i am {person['age']} years old.'</code></span>
