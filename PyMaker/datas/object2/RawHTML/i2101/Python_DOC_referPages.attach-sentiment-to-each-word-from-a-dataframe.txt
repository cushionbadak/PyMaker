<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I did a sentiment analysis of tweets but now I have to attach the sentiment to each word from the tweet text. My sentiment analysis was based on a sum of words that appeared in a dictionary. I hope this example can help you.</p>
<p>I tried to use this function but it does not work here.</p>
<pre><code>def append_sentiment(sentences, sentiment):
return [(word, sentiment) for sentence in sentences
                          for word in sentence.split()]

append_sentiment(df['text'], df['score'])
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>id | text | score

12 | I like this | 2
</code></pre>
<p>Wanted result:</p>
<pre><code>id | text | score

12 | ('I', 2), ('like', 2), ('this', 2) | 2
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can construct <code>(word, sentiment)</code> tuples easily with the use of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.repeat" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.repeat</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import repeat

mapped = df.apply(lambda row: list(zip(row.text.split(), repeat(row.score))), axis=1)
print(mapped)
0    [(I, 2), (like, 2), (this, 2)]
</code></pre>
