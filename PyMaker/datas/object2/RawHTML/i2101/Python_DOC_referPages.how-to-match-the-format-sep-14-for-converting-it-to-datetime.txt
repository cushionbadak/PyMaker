<p>I am trying to transform the column, 'issue_d' by year.</p>
<p>below is the code I have used but it gives me error</p>
<pre><code>dt_series = pd.to_datetime(df['issue_d'], format= '%m-%Y')
df['year'] = dt_series.dt.year
</code></pre>
<p>this is the error message</p>
<pre><code>ValueError: time data 'Sep-14' does not match format '%m-%Y' (match)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Looking at the error, I am pretty sure that <code>df['issue_d] = 'Sep-14'</code>. That means that you are using the wrong format string. The format string you have specified expects the months as digits and the full year (4 digits), i.e., <code>'09-2014'</code></p>
<p>What you want as a format string is <code>'%b-%y'</code> which takes the abbriviated month name in your locale and the year as two digits (starting at 2000). Thus, your line should look like</p>
<pre><code>dt_series = pd.to_datetime(df['issue_d'], format= '%b-%y')
</code></pre>
<p>The different formats can be found in the Python <code>datetime</code> documentation, found <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. </p>
