<p>I am making an excelfile through xlsxwriter and I want to have a column with dates. More specifically the dates for the upcoming month. However, I can't seem to find a way to make a column of dates at all in xlsxwriter. The date column would then also be the index. Does anyone have a simple way to do this?</p>
<p>This is what I currently have: <em>(I have extracted only my date handling for the purpose of this question)</em></p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date
import xlsxwriter

workbook = xlsxwriter.Workbook('date_newexcel.xlsx')
worksheet = workbook.add_worksheet()
bold = workbook.add_format({'bold': True})
worksheet.set_column('A:B', 30)

worksheet.write('A1', 'Formatted date', bold)
date_t  = workbook.add_format({'num_format': 'dd/mm/yyyy'})
worksheet.write(0, 0, date(2018, 10, 15), date_t)

workbook.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your code works fine for me, however you could try the <a href="https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/worksheet.html#worksheet-write-number" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>write_datetime</code></a> method:</p>
<pre><code>worksheet.write_datetime(0, 0, date(2018, 10, 15), date_t)
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to write the whole column with dates I'd iterate over the number of days you want (let's say <code>30</code>) and add 1 day at the date you write, using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.timedelta</code></a> class:</p>
<pre><code>d = date(2018, 10, 15)
for i in range(30):
    worksheet.write_datetime(i, 0, d, date_t)
    d += timedelta(days=1)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I can get one date just fine, but I want to fill in a range of dates in the Date-column I am making. Do you know how?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you mean adding consecutive dates to consecutive rows?</span>
