<p>I cannot find a clear answer on how to define multiple paths for the PYTHONPATH variable. I have tried all possible combinations of different solutions posted on various sites, but none of them work. Why can't this be clearly documented somewhere?</p>
<p>I tried every combination of separator and quoting:</p>
<pre><code>"env": {"PYTHONPATH": "D:\\Users\\path\\a\\"; "D:\\Users\\path\\b\\"},
"env": {"PYTHONPATH": "D:\\Users\\path\\a\\": "D:\\Users\\path\\b\\"},
"env": {"PYTHONPATH": "D:\\Users\\path\\a\\; D:\\Users\\path\\b\\"},
...
</code></pre>

<p>VSCode's <code>env</code> setting corresponds to operating system's environment variables.
Setting settings under the same name would either yield an error or pick one of the values. Here you should use only a single <code>env</code> setting, as well as, set <code>PYTHONPATH</code> once.</p>
<p>In order to use multiple directories, <em>one or more directory pathnames separated by os.pathsep (e.g. colons on Unix or semicolons on Windows)</em>[1]. guessing that your operating system is Windows, the setting would looke like this:</p>
<pre><code>"env": {"PYTHONPATH": "D:\\Users\\path\\a\\;D:\\Users\\path\\b\\"}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you using this <code>launch.json</code> configuration?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, this is through launch.json. The error was caused by the space; compare the different between the 3rd line in the question and @shookees answer without the space after the semicolon.</span>
