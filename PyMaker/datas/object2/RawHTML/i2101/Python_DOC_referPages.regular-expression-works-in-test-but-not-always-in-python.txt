<p>I want to match ticket IDs in ticket titles with a regular expression in Python, using the module re. The pattern is really simple:</p>
<pre><code>(\w+-\d+)
</code></pre>
<p>Works perfectly in testing (on <a href="http://regexr.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regexr.com</a>) and even in the actual program in most cases - but ONLY if the ticket title immediately starts with the ticket ID.</p>
<p>As soon as there is anything else preceding it (like "[SomeTag]"), the Python implementation no longer gives any matches, even though on regexr.com it works perfectly in this case too.</p>
<p>I've been pondering this for quite some time, tried different variations but to no avail. I would really appreciate any assistance in this matter.</p>

<p>Maybe you're using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.match()</code></a> instead of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.search()</code></a>?</p>
<p><code>re.match()</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern, return a corresponding match object. Return None if the string does not match the pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>re.search()</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scan through string looking for the first location where the regular expression pattern produces a match, and return a corresponding match object.</p>

<p>It sounds like you are using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re.match</a>. This will only match patterns at the start of the string. To match patterns anywhere in the string, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re.search</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the tip. However, the question has already been resolved.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you should have waited for the OP to include the code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that was it, thank you very much. Just found out this important detail. Now everything works as intended.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@usr2564301 It was pretty obvious what the problem was. Why make them jump through hoops?</span>
