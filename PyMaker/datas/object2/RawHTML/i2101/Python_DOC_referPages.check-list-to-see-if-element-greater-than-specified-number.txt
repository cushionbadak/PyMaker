<p>I'm trying to check if a specific element in the list is greater than a set value. </p>
<p>So </p>
<pre><code>x=22
list=[10,20,30] 

# check if anything in list is greater than x
# do something to the list
</code></pre>
<p>I'm just not sure what commands to use in this scenario to check every list element or if it's even possible in one line. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any</code></a>, Python's natural way of checking if a condition holds for, well, <em>any</em> out of many:</p>
<pre><code>x = 22 
lst = [10, 20, 30]  # do NOT use list as a variable anme

if any(y &gt; x for y in lst):
    # do stuff with lst
</code></pre>
<p><code>any</code> will terminate upon the first truthy element of the iterable it is passed and, thus, not perform any spurious iterations which makes it preferable to <code>max</code> or list comprehension based approaches that have to always iterate the entire list. Asymptotically however, its time complexity is, of course, still linear.</p>
<p>Also, you should not shadow built-in names like <code>list</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You ask for "if <em>any</em> element in the list is greater than <code>x</code>". If you just want one element, you could just find the greatest element in the list using the <code>max()</code> function, and check if it's larger than <code>x</code>: </p>
<pre><code>if max(list) &gt; x:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>There's also a one-liner you can do to make a list of <em>all</em> elements in the list greater than <code>x</code>, using <em>list comprehensions</em> (<a href="https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here's a tutorial, if you want one</a>):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 22
&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
&gt;&gt;&gt; greater = [i for i in list if i &gt; x]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(greater)
[30, 40]
</code></pre>
<p>This code generates a list <code>greater</code> of all the elements in <code>list</code> that are greater than <code>x</code>. You can see the code responsible for this: </p>
<pre><code>[i for i in list if i &gt; x]
</code></pre>
<p>This means, "Iterate over <code>list</code> and, if the condition <code>i &gt; x</code> is true for any element <code>i</code>, add that element to a new list. At the end, return that new list."</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>List comprehension would suit your use case.</p>
<pre><code>In [1]: x=22

In [2]: l=[10,20,30]

In [3]: exist = [n for n in l if n &gt; x]

In [4]: if exist:
   ...:     print "elements {} are greater than x".format(exist)
   ...: 
elements [30] are greater than x
</code></pre>
<p>If your list is very long, use generator so that you do not have to iterate through all elements of the list.</p>
<pre><code>In [5]: exist = next(n for n in l if n &gt; x)

In [6]: if exist:                          
    print "Element {} is greater than x".format(exist)
   ...:     
Element 30 is greater than x
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <code>filter</code> and filter your list for items greater than <code>22</code>, if 
the <code>len</code> of this filtered list is <code>&gt; 0</code> that means your original list contains a value larger than <code>22</code></p>
<pre><code>n = 22
lst = [10,20,30]

if len(list(filter(lambda x: x &gt; n, lst))) &gt; 0:
    # do something to lst
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to the site. Unfortunately, it's not clear what you want. Please clarify: Do you just want to know if the list contains an element greater than the given value? Or a list of all elements greater? Or if a specific element (say the 3rd element out of 5) is greater?</span>
