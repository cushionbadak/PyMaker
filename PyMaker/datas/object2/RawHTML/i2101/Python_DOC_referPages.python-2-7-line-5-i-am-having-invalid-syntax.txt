<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Been looking at this for a while and cant seem to figure out why I'm receiving invalid syntax on the if statement.</p>
<pre><code>   number = 6
   if number &gt; 5 and &lt; 9:
        print  “Yes”
   else:
        print “No”
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are missing the variable name in your second comparison:</p>
<pre><code>if number &gt; 5 and number &lt; 9:
     blah blah blah
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have made an error in declaring your if statement. Your program does not know what should be smaller than 9. The correct syntax for your problem would be:</p>
<pre><code>if 5 &lt; number &lt; 9:
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>if number &gt; 5 and number &lt; 9:
</code></pre>
