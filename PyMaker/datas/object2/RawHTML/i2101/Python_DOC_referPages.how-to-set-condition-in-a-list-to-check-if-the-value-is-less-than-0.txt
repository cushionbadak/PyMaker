<p>I am writing a weight average function,
There are four exceptions and I am stuck in how to set these conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>a weight is less than 0 or greater than 100</li>
<li>the weights do not add to 100</li>
<li>the number of weights and grades are not equal</li>
<li>a grade is below 0 </li>
</ol>
<p>Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>def weighted_avg(grades,weights):
    if sum(weights)&lt;0:
        print("weight is less than 0")
    elif sum(weights)&gt;100:
        print("weight is greater than 100")
    elif sum(weights)!=100:
        print("weight do not add to 100")
    elif for x in grades:
            if grades[x]&lt;0:
            print("a grade is less than 0")
    else:
        s=0
        for x, y in zip(grades,weights):
            s+=x*y
        return s/sum(weights)

print(weighted_avg(grades4, weights4) == 85.0)
</code></pre>
<p>I am not sure which part I was missing in my code. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I cleaned up your code a little bit:</p>
<pre><code>def weighted_avg(grades,weights):
    total_weight = sum(weights)
    if total_weight &lt; 0 or total_weight &gt; 100:
        print("Total weights not between 0 and 100")
    elif total_weight != 100:
        print("Total weights do not total 100")
    elif any(x &lt; 0 for x in grades):
        print("A grade is less than 0")
    else:
        cumulative_grades = sum(x * y for x, y in zip(grades,weights))
        return cumulative_grades/total_weight
    return 0

print(weighted_avg(grades4, weights4) == 85.0)
</code></pre>
<p>You can't use a <code>for</code> statement as part of an <code>if</code>/<code>elif</code> condition, but you can simplify your loop so that it can be checked (without iterating through the whole list) by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any</code></a>. You  should also calculate the <code>total_weight</code> once, to reduce duplicate computations. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code></a> can also take a comprehension to get your total.</p>

<p>I just solve this question when I change the order </p>
<pre><code>def weighted_avg(grades,weights):
    for x in grades:
        if x&lt;0:
            print("a grade is less than 0")     
    if sum(weights)&lt;0:
        print("weight is less than 0")
    elif sum(weights)&gt;100:
        print("weight is greater than 100")
    elif sum(weights)!=100:
        print("weight do not add to 100")
    else:
        s=0
        for x, y in zip(grades,weights):
            s+=x*y
        return s/sum(weights)

print(weighted_avg(grades4, weights4) == 85.0)

<span class="comment-copy">Replace <code>if grades[x]&lt;0:</code> by <code>if x&lt;0:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, but I got the syntax error elif for x in grades:            ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>elif for</code> is wrong! also your code indent in <code>if grades[x]&lt;0</code> is wrong</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you actually raise Exceptions instead of printing an error message, you can get rid of all the "elif" stuff. I also don't see any real use in the first two tests. Finally, the test "!=100" is likely to fail where it shouldn't, if you have floating point input values. And please provide sample input values and expected output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This doesn't actually solve your problem. Because now you have multiple prints.</span>
