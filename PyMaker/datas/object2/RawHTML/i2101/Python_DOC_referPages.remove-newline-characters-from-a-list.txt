<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have the below list</p>
<pre><code>list = ['\n                                A\n                            ', '\n                                B\n                            ', '\n                                C\n                            ', '\n                                D\n                            ']
</code></pre>
<p>Seems like list is center aligned and this list is the output of bs4 code I run. How can I remove all the newline characters from this list that the final output looks like</p>
<pre><code>list = ['A','B','C','D']
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.strip()</code></a> to remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string. To apply it to each item in the list you can use a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>lst = [item.strip() for item in lst]
</code></pre>
<p>or the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>map()</code></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>lst = list(map(str.strip, lst))
</code></pre>
<p>As a side note, don't name your variable <code>list</code> as it would shadow the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list" rel="nofollow noreferrer">function</a>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Your original list is invalid syntax. You re-bound a built-in and didn't close <code>]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@roganjosh It's fine as far as syntax.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EugeneYarmash did you try running the first line? I can't even test and it's broken from sight</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot @EugeneYarmash. Amidst confusion imposed by BeautifulSoup, I totally forgot this simple method!</span>
