<p>Suppose I have a Numpy array <strong>A</strong> that has a certain number of dimensions. For the rest of the question I will consider that <strong>A</strong> is a 4-dimensional array:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;A.shape 
(2,2,2,2)
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, I would like to access the elements </p>
<pre><code>A[:,:,1,:]
</code></pre>
<p>, but also sometimes I would like to access the elements</p>
<pre><code>A[:,1,:,:]
</code></pre>
<p>, and so on (the position of the '1' in the '1'-colon indexing "chain" is a variable).</p>
<p>How can I do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you provide a <code>:</code> when indexing, python calls that a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>slice</code></a>.  When you provide comma-separated slices, it is really just a tuple of slices.</p>
<p>The <code>:</code> is equivalent to <code>slice(None)</code>, so you can get the same effect with the following</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_index = (slice(None), 1, slice(None), slice(None))
&gt;&gt;&gt; A[my_index] == A[:,1,:,:]
True
</code></pre>
<p>You can build up your indexing programatically with this knowledge.</p>
