<p><strong>Basically:</strong></p>
<p>I am trying to convert hex to decimal using dictionaries but I can't figure out how I would convert it. I have tried using a for loop to iterate over the hexadecimal value that the user enters, and to convert each one by multiplying it to a power of 16 depending on the length of hex. For example, if the user enters F21, the program should recognise that the length is 3 so should start by multiplying 15(F) by 16^2 and add this to 2*16^1 and add this to 1*16^0. But I come across so many errors</p>
<p><strong>Hexadecimal to Decimal Dictionary:</strong></p>
<pre><code>hex_to_decimal = {
    "0":"0",
    "1":"1",
    "2":"2",
    "3":"3",
    "4":"4",
    "5":"5",
    "6":"6",
    "7":"7",
    "8":"8",
    "9":"9",
    "A":"10",
    "B":"11",
    "C":"12",
    "D":"13",
    "E":"14",
    "F":"15"
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>I am not trying to use this solution as I am trying to practice dictionaries</p>
<pre><code>s = "F21"
i = int(s, 16)

<p>Since you are converting to decimals, the default base for integers, you should make the values of <code>hex_to_demical</code> integers rather than strings, so that you can perform numeric operations on each translated hex number:</p>
<pre><code>hex_to_decimal = {
    "0": 0,
    "1": 1,
    "2": 2,
    "3": 3,
    "4": 4,
    "5": 5,
    "6": 6,
    "7": 7,
    "8": 8,
    "9": 9,
    "A": 10,
    "B": 11,
    "C": 12,
    "D": 13,
    "E": 14,
    "F": 15
}
def convert(s):
    i = 0
    for h in s:
        i = i *16 + hex_to_decimal[h]
    return i
</code></pre>
<p>with the above code,</p>
<pre><code>convert('F21')
</code></pre>
<p>would return:</p>
<pre><code>3873
</code></pre>

<p>Simply look over both the index <code>i</code> and the digit <code>n</code> of the hex string using <code>enumerate()</code>, and do the computation <code>n_dec*16**i</code> (e.g. with <code>n_dec = 15</code> when <code>n = F</code>). Specifically, we have <code>n_dec = int(hex_to_decimal[n])</code>, with the <code>int()</code> needed because you store the values of your <code>dict</code> as <code>str</code>s. Finally, <code>sum</code> everything up:</p>
<pre><code>s_hex = "F21"
s_dec = str(sum(
    int(hex_to_decimal[n])*16**i for i, n in enumerate(reversed(s_hex))
))
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>reversed()</code> is needed because the first (hexadecimal) digits refer to the larger values.
The <code>str()</code> is used just to keep the final decimal result as a <code>str</code>, just as the values in your <code>dict</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"But I come across so many errors" what errors? you need to show us what you've tried and specifically what's going wrong if we are going to be able to help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Aaron The solution was spaghetti code and I don't want to improve it, but would like an alternative efficient way of completing this task</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, except it would be <code>i = i *16 + int(hex_to_decimal[h])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welcome. Like I mentioned, you don't need the <code>int</code> conversion if you initialize your <code>hex_to_decimal</code> with integers rather than strings.</span>
