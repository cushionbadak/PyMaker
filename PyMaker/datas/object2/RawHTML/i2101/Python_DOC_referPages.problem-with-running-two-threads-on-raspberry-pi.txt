<p>I have a streaming program that sends frames of captured video taken by picamera from raspberry to server and another program that receive some characters from server. when I run them individually there is no problem but i want them to run them simultaneously to do some functions when for example 'a' pressed on server so i threaded them but it makes streaming so slow. Is there any solution to fix this problem?</p>
<p>server.py:</p>
<pre><code>def get_input(c):
    #getting input characters from keyboard and send them to raspberry 
def get_video(c):
    #getting video frames form raspberry 

thread.start_new_thread(get_video, ("2",))
thread.start_new_thread(get_input, ("1",))

while 1:
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>raspberry.py:</p>
<pre><code>def get_input(c):
    #getting input chars from server
def send_video(c):
    #sending video frames to server

thread.start_new_thread(send_video, ("2",))
thread.start_new_thread(get_input, ("1",))

while 1:
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>In order to fix the problem you need first to find out what is the reason of it. </p>
<p>One obvious problem here is that this code:</p>
<pre><code>while 1:
   pass
</code></pre>
<p>executes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">busy loop</a>. So it uses CPU resources but does nothing substantial. You may replace <code>pass</code> with <code>sleep(0.1)</code> there or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Thread.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wait for thread to finish</a> (this would require however to switch to <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">threading</a> module)</p>
<p>Another possible problem may be the similar issue in <code>get_input</code> (you haven't shown its source). Make sure you don't have any busy waiting there. Some small <code>sleep</code> (50-100 ms) should be enough to give time for other thread to execute and would not affect user experience much.</p>
<p>In general use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">profiler</a> to check where you program spends time.</p>
