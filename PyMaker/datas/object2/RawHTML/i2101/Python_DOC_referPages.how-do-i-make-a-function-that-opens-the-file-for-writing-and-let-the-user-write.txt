<p>How do I make a function that 1. opens a file for writing, 2. Let the user write in text in a while loop that continue with new lines using("\n") to the user write "stop", and then the loop goes over to step 3. close the file. </p>
<p>So far I got this</p>
<pre><code>def writesomething(filename):
    file1=open("randomfile","w")
    file1.write("")
    file1.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First collect all the input, then <code>.join()</code> it with a <code>\n</code> then write it all at once.</p>
<pre><code>text = []
user = input('Enter text to write to file (\'quit\') to end: ')
text.append(user)
while user != 'quit':
    user = input('Enter text to write to file (\'quit\') to end: ')
    text.append(user)
res = '\n'.join(text)
with open('text.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(res)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Enter text to write to file ('quit') to end: vash
Enter text to write to file ('quit') to end: the
Enter text to write to file ('quit') to end: stampede
Enter text to write to file ('quit') to end: quit
chrx@chrx:~/python/stackoverflow/10.11$ cat text.txt
vash
the
stampede

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>iter</code></a> function with a sentinel of <code>stop</code>, then join the resulting sequence strings with <code>'\n'</code> for output:</p>
<pre><code>with open('randomfile', 'w') as f:
    f.write('\n'.join(iter(input, 'stop')))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You acknowledge that a <code>while</code> loop is necessary in step 2; where is the loop in your code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, thatÂ´s one of my questions.</span>
