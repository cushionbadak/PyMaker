<p>My code pretty much asks user input and a pre made text which it prints to the .txt file. I want to add the character calculator to print into the file, not as a print. Is it possible?</p>
<pre><code>input = input(str("Type something: "))
file = open("harjoitus.txt", "w")
file.write(str("This code is here automatically.\n"))
file.write(str(input))
file.write(str("\n",))
file.close()

with open("harjoitus.txt", 'r') as file:
    text = file.read().strip().split()
    len_chars = sum(len(word) for word in text)
    print(len_chars)
</code></pre>
<p>This pretty much prints the amount of characters as print not to the text file how I want it. Is it possible to edit this somehow that it prints the character amount straight to the file and not as a print?</p>

<p>First before you go into this appending, take a look at how many places you are calling <code>str()</code> its unnecessary most of these values are already stings and ready to be written. Also avoid variable names like <code>input</code> that have preassigned purposes in python. But to add this <code>count</code> to the end, <code>collections.Counter</code> is an option, you should open the file as <code>a</code> append. Then you can add this number to the end of your file. </p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

user = input("Type something: ")
with open('harjoitus.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write("This code is here automatically.\n")
    f.write(user)
    f.write("\n")

with open('harjoitus.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()

c = Counter(content)
tot = sum(c.values())

with open('harjoitus.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write(str(tot))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>chrx@chrx:~/python/stackoverflow/10.11$ python3.7 stack.py 
Type something: vash
chrx@chrx:~/python/stackoverflow/10.11$ cat harjoitus.txt 
This code is here automatically.
vash

<span class="comment-copy">change <code>print(len_chars)</code> to <code>file.write(len_chars)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>print()</code> command is for printing something to console. If you want to write into a file, you can use <code>f.write()</code> as in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KurtisStreutker doesn't work, even if I change it to "w"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@G.Anderson I know that it does, that's why I'm asking how can I make it to print it to the file, as I don't know how to.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note: <code>input = input(str("Type something: "))</code> is <i>asking</i> for trouble. Don't name-shadow built-ins, especially built-ins you're <i>actively using</i>! <b>Edit:</b> Ah, in your actual code it's a Finnish name that doesn't shadow anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much. This was a new thing for me, so I didn't really know what to do. Thanks for the comment, I'll make sure to study this :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Koppis no prob, glad to help! Cheers :)</span>
