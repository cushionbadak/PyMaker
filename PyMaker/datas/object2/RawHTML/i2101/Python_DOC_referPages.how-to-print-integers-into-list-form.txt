<p>I am kind of new to python. I am trying to print only the integers in a list divisible by 5. Which I have done. But I want the output to be a list, not only the integers.</p>
<p>My Code:</p>
<pre><code>list = [2,4,5,10,12]
for x in list:
if not x % 5 == 0:
    print (x)
</code></pre>
<p>I want the output to look like:
[2,4,12]</p>
<p>But intsead it looks like: </p>
<p>2,</p>
<p>4,</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Is there any commands to print the "x" items into a list? Like print(list[x])?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to collect your answers in a new list and then print that list. You can do this by creating an empty list and using the <code>.append()</code> method to add items to that list.</p>
<pre><code>my_list = [2,4,5,10,12]
answers = []
for x in my_list:
    if not x % 5 == 0:
        answers.append(x)
print(answers)
</code></pre>
<p>A <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html?highlight=comprehensions#generator-expressions-and-list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a> is another option. A list comprehension is a powerful shortcut that creates the second list for you automatically.</p>
<p>For this problem, you could use:</p>
<pre><code>my_list = [2,4,5,10,12]
answers = [x for x in my_list if x%5 != 0]
print(answers)
</code></pre>
<p>which accomplishes the same thing as the <code>for</code> loop in fewer lines. In this case, you may have to use the <code>for</code> version, but you may want to use a comprehension in the future.</p>

<p>This is how I achieved that. I hope it helps:</p>
<pre><code>list1 = [2,4,5,10,12]
list2 = []
for x in list1:
    if not x % 5 == 0:
        list2.append(x)
print(list2)
</code></pre>

<p>The OP, using the following numbers [2,4,5,10,12] is "trying to print only the integers in a list divisible by 5.  I want the output to look like: [2,4,12]"</p>
<p>Generally, "numbers divisible by 5" are capable of being divided by 5 without a remainder.  From the given list the output would be [5,10]</p>
<pre><code>data = [2, 4, 5, 10, 12]

# Print numbers evenly divisible by 5.
print([i for i in data if i % 5 == 0])

[5, 10]
</code></pre>
<p>From the output provided by the OP, he's looking for numbers where there is a remainder after dividing by 5.</p>
<pre><code>data = [2, 4, 5, 10, 12]

# Print numbers not evenly divisible by 5.
print([i for i in data if i % 5])

[2, 4, 12]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I used the end command. I did print(x, end =", "), That gives me: 2, 4, 12,... But I want it to be in a "list"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do a <i>list comprehension</i>: <code>[x for x in lst if x%5]</code> - Also don't shadow builtin names such as <code>list</code>. The list comprehension creates a new list which you can then print or use in any way you see fit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have to use the for and if statements for this assignment. How would I use the print command to print the list as a list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this code may answer the question, providing additional context regarding how and/or why it solves the problem would improve the answer's long-term value.</span>
