<p>I am trying to have a user input items into a list, and then have all the items they entered go into a list. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>itemList = []
items = input ("Enter all items: ")
</code></pre>
<p>What I would like to do is, if user inputs "Test Test2 Test3 Test4", each of the items (seperated by the spaces) gets put into the itemList. </p>
<p>Sorry if I did not explain it very well, and I am not sure if this is even possible.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>You want to create a list consisting of the input string, split on spaces (calling "split()" defaults to splitting a string on spaces).</p>
<pre><code>items = input ("Enter all items: ")
itemList = [i for i in items.split()]
print(itemList)
</code></pre>
<p>Output, using your suggested input:</p>
<pre><code>['Test', 'Test2', 'Test3', 'Test4']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You need to visit a tutorial, not ask here. Try <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a> . <code>solution = "One Two Three".split()</code> does what you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>itemList=input ("Enter all items: ").split(" ")</code> should be enough</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mad_: Typically, you'd omit the argument to <code>split</code> entirely. That makes it strip leading and trailing whitespace, and split on runs of whitespace, so having two spaces or a tab between your inputs doesn't add an empty string to your result list in the former case, or fail to split at all in the latter case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>[i for i in items.split()]</code> is completely pointless. <code>items.split()</code> already returns a <code>list</code>, wrapping it in a no-op <code>list</code> comprehension just makes a new <code>list</code> for no reason.</span>
