How to do do it  ?</p>

<p>I am assuming you are doing <code>import script</code> within the <code>executor.py</code> script. If this is the case you have to add to <code>executor.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import script
import sys
argument_1 = sys.argv[1] # since [0] is the script name
...
script.yourfunction(argument_1)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>assuming script.py and executor.py are in the same folder:</p>
<p>script.py:</p>
<pre><code>def function1(somearg, otherarg):
    pass
def function2(moreargs):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>and executor.py</p>
<pre><code>import sys
import script

# assign input args; check for valid arguments etc..
arg1 = sys.argv[1]
arg2 = sys.argv[2]
etc...

# call system functions
script.function1(arg1, arg2)
script.function2(arg1)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Would you run script.py inside executor.py ? <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>subprocess</i></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kcorlidy no , it is not directly being executed in executor.py , There are many functions inside script.py which are being called in executor.py at multiple places . I just want to catch the arg1 in my script.py , then everything will fall in place .</span>
