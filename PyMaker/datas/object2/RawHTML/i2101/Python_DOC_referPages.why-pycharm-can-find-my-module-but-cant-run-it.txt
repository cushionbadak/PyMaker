<p>I am a novice about Python and Pycharm.  I followed the tutorial wrote the code below:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z9zeF.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/z9zeF.png"/></a></p>
<p>This code can run well on IDLE. But can't run in Pycharm.</p>
<p>I searched online. The answers I found are about Pycharm interpreter setting. My interpreter setting is good.  It can find the module.  But when I run it, There are exceptions.<br/>
I spent several hours try to solve this problem, still don't know why.</p>

<p>Change your filename to <strong>somethingelse.py</strong></p>
<p><em>EDIT (with a better explanation:)</em> </p>
<p>What is happening here is that OP is trying to <code>import tkinter</code>. However, since they have named their file "<code>tkinter.py</code>," the interpreter thinks that this is the module OP is referencing. For this reason, OP is not getting the desired results, and instead is getting an error about missing attributes.</p>
<p>This probably worked for OP in the IDLE environment, because IDLE allows you to execute the code from within the environment as if you were in a terminal. Pycharm was trying to have the Python interpreter execute the .py file that OP had pulled up.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">could you provide the error message including the exceptions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please do not post images of your code.   Pasting your code into your question will make it easier for the community to assist you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the error message said: name 'Frame' is not defined</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Change your import to 'Tkinter' and try running your code again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The Tkinter is for Python2.x.   I use Python3.7.   If I change it. The error message said:No module named 'Tkinter' name 'Frame' is not defined</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It works!!!    So I can't use the name same as module?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't. If you do that, import statements will resolve to your module, not to the module you want to import.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot. I wasted lot of time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KaiyangLi correct, you're confusing the interpreter!</span>
