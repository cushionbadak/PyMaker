<p>I started learning Python code recently and one simple print statement is giving me trouble since last 4 days.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> the print statement is not working inside the <code>validatePostcode(postcode)</code> method for if-statement. The assigned value is 200 (status code) which is printing fine without the if-statement. Also, when I compare with the True (result value) for that API it works fine without if-statement, why it is not working after I apply the if and try to compare?</p>
<p><strong>Error:</strong> </p>
<pre><code>  File "./py_script3.py", line 32
    print ("Congrats")
        ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block

<p>This piece of code (which is generating the error):</p>
<pre><code>if Value == 200 : 
print ("Congrats")
</code></pre>
<p>Should be</p>
<pre><code>if Value == 200 : 
    print ("Congrats")
</code></pre>
<p>Because python expects an indented block after the conditional, just like the message error is saying to you</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should indent the print statement like so:</p>
<pre><code>if Value == 200 :
   print ("Congrats")
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of a logical line is used to compute the indentation level of the line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By doing </p>
<pre><code>if Value == 200:
print ("Congrats")
</code></pre>
<p>Python interprets the two lines as two different groups of statements. What you should do is:</p>
<pre><code>if Value == 200:
    print ("Congrats")
</code></pre>

<p>Need to add an indent after the if statement. You can do so by pressing return after typing the colon</p>

<span class="comment-copy">After a line with <code>if...:</code> an indented block with code to execute conditionally is expected.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added a line in between my if statement and print statement, but does not work, is that what you suggested Michael ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can I have an example pleasE?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Adding a line doesn't work. If you are not familiar enough with Python you should start with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well Sure, as I said I recently started, I am learning on the fly. I just needed and example to add the indented block after if statement. Anyways thanks Michael</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great , I am not getting the error of indented block now, but its not printing the "Congrats"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have sure that the <code>Value</code> is <code>200</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">figured out why not working...the if was not able to compare the numeric value as string. I am good with my script Thanks so much Mr Tacon.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use <code>int(Value)</code> to cast it to an integer</span>
