<p>I'm trying to get files uploaded through the Django admin site to be placed on a network drive. Lets say the path to this drive is '\\FILESERVER\Django'.</p>
<p>My initial thought was to just set my media root to the same path I'd use to access the drive via File Explorer:</p>
<pre><code>#settings.py
MEDIA_ROOT = r'\\FILESERVER\Django'
</code></pre>
<p>An Example Model:</p>
<pre><code>#models.py
class Article(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    pdf = models.FileField(upload_to='articles', blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
</code></pre>
<p>But when I upload a file, It just creates the folder on my local C: drive. 
(e.g. C:\FILESERVER\Django\articles). Is there a way I can tell Django that this is supposed to be a path to a network drive?</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a Django 2.0.4 app running on a windows machine.</p>

<p>I believe what you're looking for is in <code>pathlib</code>. Have a look here:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#methods-and-properties" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#methods-and-properties</a></p>
<p>Something like <code>PureWindowsPath('//FILESERVER/Django').drive</code> should do the trick for <code>MEDIA_ROOT</code>, IIRC.</p>

<p>If you use a network file server,you may need  a customized django file storage class.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried to point it out to the internal IP address of the network drive? <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1034595/how-can-i-find-the-ip-address-of-a-mapped-network-drive-in-windows-10">Here's</a> how you can find it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Exactly what I needed, Thanks!</span>
