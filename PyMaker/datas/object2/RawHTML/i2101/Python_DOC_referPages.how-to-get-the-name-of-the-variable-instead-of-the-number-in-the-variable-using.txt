<p>I am trying to grab integers from a database, print them out in there rows, and at the end of printing them out tell me what integer is the greatest and least.  I am using the max and min functions and instead of doing what i want it to do it is printing out the largest and least number of all the variables instead of printing out the variable itself.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As others have pointed out, what you're doing is very tedious and you should consider going through some more tutorials. Nonetheless, to solve your problem of getting the "name" of the max or min number, you can store a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list</code></a> of strings like this:</p>
<pre><code>number_names = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine', 'ten']
# and so on for all numbers
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can get the name of a number by accessing the value at that index in your list. Like this:</p>
<pre><code>print(number_names[0]) # prints 'zero'
print(number_names[5]) # prints 'five'
print(number_names[7]) # prints 'seven'
</code></pre>
<p>So, in your last few print statements, you can have:</p>
<pre><code>print('the number of times that the Greatest number has been played is', number_names[GreatestNum])
print('the number of times that the Least number has been played is', number_names[LeastNum])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Your question is a litte confusing. What exactly have you tried and where is your error, then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should really learn to use data structures before continuing with this task. Perhaps go through the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's sort of impressive that you persevered through writing that, but did you not wonder if there were better ways? It seems like you just want a <code>collections.Counter</code>, which exposes the <code>most_common</code> value for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To get the English name of the number, consider storing a mapping from the number to its name in a dictionary <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">My problem is that when i am using the min and max functions it gives me a an integer not the variable name.  is there another function or some code i can right to make it print the name of the variable and not the integer?</span>
