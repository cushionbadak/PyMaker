<p>The below code is reading a file called ‘test.txt’ which has hex numbers. The below code is converting these hex number into decimal numbers. How can I write the decimal number to a file instead of printing it out?</p>
<p>my code</p>
<pre><code>file= 'test.txt'

with open(file) as fp:
   line = fp.readline()
   cnt = 1
   while line:
       i = int(line, 16)
       print(str(i))
       line = fp.readline()
       cnt += 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code> fp = open("file.txt", "w")
 fp.write("your data") 
</code></pre>
<p>should work.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Actually the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built in print function</a> has a file keyword argument. You can use this to redirect your output to a file of your choice.</p>
<pre><code>input_file = 'test.txt'
output_file = 'out.txt'

with open(input_file, 'r') as fp:
    with open(output_file, 'w') as out_fp:
        line = fp.readline()
        cnt = 1
        while line:
            i = int(line, 16)
            print(str(i), file=out_fp)
            line = fp.readline()
            cnt += 1
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming you have <code>test.txt</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>ff
10
</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>out.txt</code> will contain:</p>
<pre><code>255
16
</code></pre>
<p>As of python 2.7 or python 3.1 you can even combine those two with statements</p>
<pre><code>...
with open(input_file, 'r') as fp, open(output_file, 'w') as out_fp:
    ...
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I wonder who thought that removing code from the question was funny.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you able to show me using your code with mine? not sure if i am placing your code in the right place.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you able to show me with using my code above please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I have updated my answer assuming you want to write your output to a different file.</span>
