<p>This is mostly a question of good/pythonic style. I have a dictionary which has lists for values, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>my_dict = {"a": a_list, "b": b_list, "c": c_list}
</code></pre>
<p>and so on. I also have an empty dictionary with the same keys, in which I want to store the mean of these lists against their key. If instead of using a second dictionary, I used a nested list, I could do</p>
<pre><code>mean_lists = [[key, sum(l)/len(l)] for key, l in my_dict.items() if l]
</code></pre>
<p>giving an output</p>
<pre><code>[["a", a_mean], ["b", b_mean], ["c", c_mean]]
</code></pre>
<p>which seems neat to me. Is there a way to do this nicely outputting as a dictionary, or is something like this:</p>
<pre><code>mean_dict = {key: [] for key in my_dict}
for key, l in my_dict.items():
    if l:
        mean_dict[key] = sum(l)/len(l)
</code></pre>
<p>the best I can do?</p>

<p>Yes, by using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>dictionary comprehension</em></a>; you already have the parts to build each key and value together in your list comprehension, just alter the syntax a little:</p>
<pre><code>{key: sum(l) / len(l) for key, l in my_dict.items() if l}
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax is closely related to list comprehensions, but instead of a single expression for each list element value, you have two expressions: one for the key (just <code>key</code> in the above example) and one for the associated value (<code>sum(l) / len(l)</code> in the above).</p>
<p>You already appear to be familiar with the syntax, as you created a dictionary mapping from keys to empty lists:</p>
<pre><code>mean_dict = {key: [] for key in my_dict}
</code></pre>
<p>before using a separate loop to replace those lists with the <code>sum(l) / len(l)</code> calculations for the exact same keys.</p>

<p>Use a dictionary comprehension!</p>
<pre><code>mean_lists = {key:sum(l)/len(l) for key, l in my_dict.items() if l}
</code></pre>
