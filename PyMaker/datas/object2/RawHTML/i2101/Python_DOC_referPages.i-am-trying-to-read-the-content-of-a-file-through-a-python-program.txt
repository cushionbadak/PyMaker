<p>The problem is related to the text file path.
As soon as i copy the text file in the directory
of the python program and run it,it runs successfully.
Here is the code-&gt;</p>
<pre><code>ana=open("C:\Users\HP\Downloads\practice1.txt","r")
pj=ana.read()
ana.close()
pj=pj.splitlines()
print(pj)
for i in pj:
    print(i)

<p>The error displayed is-&gt;</p>
<pre><code>[unicode error] 'unicodeescape'  codec can't decode bytes in position 2-3:truncated\UXXXXXXXX escape

<p>Try any of the below :</p>
<pre><code>ana=open(r'C:\Users\HP\Downloads\practice1.txt')
ana=open('C:\\Users\\HP\\Downloads\\practice1.txt')
ana=open('C:/Users/HP/Downloads/practice1.txt')
</code></pre>

<p>The backslash character (\) has a special meaning when it appears in a string (or bytes) literal in Python. Backslash is used to <em>escape</em> characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash itself, or the quote character.</p>
<pre><code>ana=open("C:\Users\HP\Downloads\practice1.txt","r")
</code></pre>
<p>In your example, Python is trying to escape the <code>U</code>, <code>H</code>, <code>D</code> and <code>p</code> characters because they have backslashes in front of them!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Python provides us with a syntax that allows us to write strings containing literal backslash characters. Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called <em>raw strings</em> and treat backslashes as literal characters.</p>
<pre><code>ana=open(r"C:\Users\HP\Downloads\practice1.txt","r")
</code></pre>
<p>Now the backslash characters are treated as normal characters, and no escaping is attempted.</p>
