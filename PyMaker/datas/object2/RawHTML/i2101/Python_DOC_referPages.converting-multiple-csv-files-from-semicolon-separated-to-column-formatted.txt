<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to write a code which takes all the .csv files in a directory, which are semi colon delimited, and formats the .csv file into columns. This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import glob
path = r'C:...'
csv_file = path + "\*.csv"
allFiles = glob.glob(path + "\*.csv")

for file in allFiles:
 dataframe = pd.read_csv(file, delimiter=';')
 dataframe.to_csv(file, encoding='utf-8', index=False)
</code></pre>
<p>I have tested the dataframe = part of this code, it works as desired for one .csv file, but I cannot get this to repeat for all files in the folder. Any ideas? Thanks. </p>
</div>

<p>You can use <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pandas</a> and do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

df1 = pd.read_csv("csv_semicolon.csv", delimiter=";")
df1.to_csv("csv_tab.csv", sep="\t", index=False)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If all you want to do is change <code>;</code> to <code>,</code> in the files, something like this would work:</p>
<pre><code>for root, dirs, files in os.walk("/dirname/"):
    csv_files = [ff for ff in files if ff.endswith('.csv')]
    for f in csv_files:
        with open(f) as tf:
            s = f.read()
        with open(f, "w") as tf:
            f.write(s.replace(";", ","))
</code></pre>
</div>
