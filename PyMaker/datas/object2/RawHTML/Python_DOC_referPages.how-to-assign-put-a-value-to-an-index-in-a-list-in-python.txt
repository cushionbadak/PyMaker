<p>I'm creating this program in python that calculates you total cost according to how much you choose.
so the program is pizza delivery, and the user has to choose their choice of pizza out of the menu.
what I cant figure out is that how to tell python that whatever the users first,second and third choice is, the cost will be 3 dollars and the rest would be 5 dollars. 
what I mean in more dept would be that how do i tell python that the users 1st,2nd,3rd choice/input = $3.</p>
<p>I tried writing: menu[0:3] = 3 but that just changes the food in the array/list.

<p><strong>Code :</strong></p>
<pre><code>i = 1
total_cost = 0
while(True):

    if(i&lt;4):
        price = 3
        total_cost = total_cost + price
    else:
        price = 5
        total_cost = total_cost + price
    i = i + 1
    check = input("Do you want to enter another choice? (y/n)")

<p>Try this function:</p>
<pre><code>def price(choice):
    if choice &lt;= 3:
        cost = 3
    else:
        cost = 5
     return cost

price(4)

&gt; 5
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can create a counter variable for tracking inputs, increment it after taking each input. And then in the price section of your code, use an if statement to set price to 3 if counter &lt; 4, else set price to 5.</p>
<pre><code># Create counter variable
counter = 0

# Taking user input code here
counter = counter + 1

# Later when setting price in code
if counter &lt; 4:
    price = 3
else:
    price = 5

<p>Hope this gives you some ideas, feel free to comment and ask for more clarification if you need to!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(1, number_of_pizza+1):
    if i &lt; 4:
        total_cost += 3
    if i &gt;= 4:
        total_cost += 5
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>According to my understanding of your question, you would want to have the menu items separated in the list as : </p>
<pre><code>menu = ['Cheese', 'Vege delight', 'pineapple', 'pepperoni','meat lovers', 'butter chicken', 'spicy corn delight', 'veg slingshot']
</code></pre>
<p>and not in the way in which you had shown it in your image.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@ Terry Jan Reedy sorry</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hi, thank you so much for the help because your solution made my code more efficient and also i can easily understand the code. so once again thank for helping me solve the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there is however one problem, 'i' will always will be smaller than 4 so the price will always be $3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Most welcome ! Kindly accept my answer &amp; give upvote.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh ! yes. good catchup (y) I update the code . kindly check. the value of <code>i</code> must be incremented by 1 in each iteration.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">usman, it works thank you for updating it and helping me once again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ill try this and update you if it works better than the other ones.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it didn't work for me unfortunately</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for sharing and trying to help, ill try it out and update you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes that was a mistake and i didn't want it that way, thanks for sharing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If my answer was of any help to you, please don't forget to upvote it! Thanks!</span>
