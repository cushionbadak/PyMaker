<p>I have a list where the items are dictionaries. the dictionary values are in unicode format and am trying to compare the unicode values to strings. So, I tried a below lambda function expecting a conversion of unicode to string; </p>
<pre><code>a=[(lambda x: x.unicode('UTF-8') ) for i in paid_submissions[0].values()]

print(a)
</code></pre>

<p>Because you're just returning the lambda object without calling it on anything. If I understand what you're trying to do correctly, you would need to call the lambda on <code>i</code> like so.</p>
<pre><code>a = [(lambda x: x.unicode('UTF-8'))(i) for i in paid_submissions[0].values()]
</code></pre>
<p>But the <code>lambda</code> expression is a waste. This can be more easily (and more efficiently) written as</p>
<pre><code>a = [i.unicode('UTF-8') for i in paid_submissions[0].values()]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks , the second syntax without lambda works! However the first syntax with lambda throws an error like;                                                                           TypeError: &lt;lambda&gt;() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Thirai I had forgotten to pass the <code>i</code> in the first one but it should be fixed now. You shouldn't use it anyway -- hence why I'm not used to writing it :)</span>
