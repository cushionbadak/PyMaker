<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/library/bisect.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>bisect</code></a> is part of the standard library - is that the sort of thing you're looking for?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's worth noting that there are a couple high-quality Python libraries for maintaining a sorted list which also implement fast searching: <a href="http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/" rel="noreferrer">sortedcontainers</a> and <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blist/" rel="noreferrer">blist</a>. Using these depends of course on how often you're inserting/removing elements from the list and needing to search. Each of those modules provide a <a href="http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/sortedlist.html" rel="noreferrer">SortedList</a> class which efficiently maintains the items in sort order.</p>
<p>From the documentation for SortedList:</p>
<pre><code>L.bisect_left(value)
    Similar to the bisect module in the standard library, this returns
    an appropriate index to insert value in L. If value is already present
    in L, the insertion point will be before (to the left of) any existing
    entries.

L.bisect(value)
    Same as bisect_left.

L.bisect_right(value)
    Same as bisect_left, but if value is already present in L, the
    insertion point will be after (to the right of) any existing entries.
</code></pre>
<p>Both implementations use binary search to find the correct index of the given value. There's a <a href="http://www.grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/performance.html" rel="noreferrer">performance comparison</a> page for choosing between the two modules.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I am the author of the sortedcontainers module.</p>

<p>Python:</p>

    # https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html
    'Locate the leftmost value exactly equal to x'
    i = bisect_left(sorted_list, elem)

<span class="comment-copy">Sequence of what? Also, what kind of search (binary, etc.)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe the question is trying to be "canonical" or "generic" and so the meaning of "sequence" may be using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-str-unicode-list-tuple-bytearray-buffer-xrange" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python documentation definition of a <code>sequence</code> (i.e. python 2.x "There are seven sequence types: strings, Unicode strings, lists, tuples, bytearrays, buffers, and xrange objects.")</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">that doesn't explain how to search for the value in the list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">From the link you provided: "The bisect() functions are useful for finding insertion points but can be tricky or awkward to use for common searching tasks."</span>
