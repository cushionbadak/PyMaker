<pre><code>if GPA == unweighted:

A = 4
A- = 3.67
B+ = 3.33
B = 3.0
value1 = credits*grade1

<p>Ok so I am trying to assign those number values to those variables if the if statement is true, but when I run the program, it says there is a syntax error. Can someone please help me fix this? Thanks.</p>

<p>You can't use operators as part of the identifiers for your variables. Full explanation in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python docs about identifiers</a></p>
<p>The Python interpreter will identify the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> as actual code to execute and not as part of you variables names like <code>A+</code>.</p>
<p>In Python as well as in other programming languages the only allowed characters for variable identifiers are letters (<code>a-z</code>, <code>A-Z</code>), numbers (<code>0-9</code>) and underscore (<code>_</code>). Though keep in mind there is an extra rule that specified you can't start an identifier with a number as well. Additional to that, in Python 3 (via <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3131/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 3131</a>) support was added for non-ASCII characters, meaning you could even write your variables in Russian (<code>картофель = 10</code>).</p>
<p>I would rename those variables as <code>a_plus</code>, <code>a_minus</code> o <code>b_plus</code>.</p>

<p>Why not use a dictionary?   You can store the weighted and unweighted grade scales with the grades as keys.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you please elaborate on what you mean by this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BruhKey: As per the valid syntaxes for variable names in python, arithmetic operators like +, -, /, *, ^, = etc. cannot be used in variable names.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when defining your variables, you are using operators like <code>-</code> (minus which is used for substraction) inside your variable identifiers ('names'), e.g. in <code>A-</code>. This is not possible in python Syntax.</span>
