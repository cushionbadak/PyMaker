<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am a python beginner. I recently learned that list and tuple allow value assignment.</p>
<pre><code>## 1)
a=[1,2,3,4]
[j,c,d,f] = a
print (j)  # prints 1
## 2)
t=(6,7,8,9)
(s1,s2,s3,s4) = t
print (s1)  # prints 6
## 3)
m={11,12,13}
{s,d,c}=m
print(s)     #Gives error
</code></pre>
<p>I am unable to understand this behavior. Why similar operation with set gives error. Also, similar operation is possible with dictionary as well ?
Kindly help and explain.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The behaviour you see with lists and tuples is called <em>iterable unpacking</em>, and is used to unpack values from any sequence into variables (as long as there are as many variables on the left as there are on the rightâ€”unless you're using <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">extended iterable unpacking</a>).</p>
<p>Given</p>
<pre><code>a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
b = (1, 2, 3, 4)
c = {1, 2, 3, 4}
</code></pre>
<p>The following are all valid operations:</p>
<pre><code>e, f, g, h = a
# Equivalent to
# (e, f, g, h) = a
# Also equivalent to, but slightly different than
# [e, f, g, h] = a
w, x, y, z = b
p, q, r, s = c
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax is not supported for sets, however, because they do not have any inherent ordering (at least, not until python3.6). So,</p>
<pre><code>{p, q, r, s} = a
</code></pre>
<p>Is invalid syntax (<code>SyntaxError: can't assign to literal</code>) because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python's grammar specification</a> does not support it.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">A set does not have any inherent ordering, so it is not appropriate to use with unpacking assignment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@coldspeed Perhaps the error message could be improved, but I guess <i>you</i> don't have control over it :) <code>{s, d, c} = m</code> raises <code>SyntaxError: can't assign to literal</code> which may be confusing, since <code>(s, d, c) = m</code> and <code>[s, d, c] = m</code> work as expected. Perhaps the error should be <code>TypeError: can't assign to set literal</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also: <code>[j,c,d,f] = a</code> is not needed - <code>j,c,d,f = a</code> is enough - when you put [] or () around , it does nothing for the decomposing - my guess would be that it constructs a list / tuple that is immediatly disposed of because it is not stored... not sure</span>
