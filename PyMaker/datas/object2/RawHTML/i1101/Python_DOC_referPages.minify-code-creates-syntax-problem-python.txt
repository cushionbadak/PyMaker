<span class="comment-copy">"to save stress on my hard disk computer" This might be a reasonable approach if your harddisk is from the 80th. A simple Python script is no stress for any drive produced in this millennium.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">When I post this code into IDLE, it says that the syntax error is at <code>while True:</code> with <code>while</code> highlighted, and the character position of 136 agrees. The Python reference says (at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html</a>) "Several simple statements may occur on a single line separated by semicolons." That seems to imply that compound statements (such as one introduced by <code>while</code>) can not.</span>
