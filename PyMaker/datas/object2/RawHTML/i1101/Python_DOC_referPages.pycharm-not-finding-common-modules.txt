<p>I'm unable to import modules in pycharm, however i am easily able to do it via the cmd (after i've typed) python and via the python console in Pycharm as well. I am using python 2.7 and python.exe is in my PATH. </p>
<p>In Pycharm when i go into setting and look at the interpreter i can clearly see the module (pytesseract) </p>
<p>I am using pycharm 2018.3.2</p>
<p>Here are the images. </p>

<p>There are 2 ways that PyCharm will reference a python interpreter, and you have to make sure they are both configured correctly. They perform different functions, and do so independently of one another.</p>
<p>The first place is in 'File=&gt;Settings=&gt;Project:x=&gt;Project Interpreter'. PyCharm will use the interpreter (ie: python environment) you select here to analyze your code within the IDE.</p>

<p>The second place is in Run/Debug Configurations. This allows you to specify multiple configurations for running your project. Each configuration can specify a different python interpreter for running / debugging your code. Each configuration you create will add a corresponding option to the dropdown in the main interface.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Seems you are using <code>venv</code>.  I'm not too familiar, but did you <code>activate</code> your <code>venv</code> environment containing the <code>pytesseract</code> module?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i didn't even know i was using a venv, i was under the influence i was using my normal environment. How can i deactivate venv?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Again I'm not too familiar with <code>venv</code>, but here's the documentation that might help you: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your detailed answer. This fixed my issue!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@workerbee Glad it helped! I love seeing people use PyCharm, it's a pretty awesome IDE! Here's a handy trick PyCharm offers that I wish I knew about on day 1: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/type-hinting-in-product.html#adding-type-hints" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Totally agree, before pycharm i was running pdb to debug my code and that was a pain!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have never seen pdb before. It looks a bit fun, but debugging with that would definitely be a lot of work compared to an IDE!</span>
