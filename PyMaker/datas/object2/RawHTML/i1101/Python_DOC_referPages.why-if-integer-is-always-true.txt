<p>I am a bit confused with if/else statement. Why the code always prints True while it should be False.</p>
<p>I have tried with different variables like <code>i =10</code>, <code>i = 'a'</code>, <code>i = 25</code>. And it will be False if <code>i=[]</code></p>
<p>This is my code:</p>
<p><code>i =1
if i:
    print True
else:
    print False</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your code you say <code>if I: True</code>. But your not comparing it to anything.  You need a comparison operator. Like <code>if i == 1</code> otherwise the if statement will just be true IF I has a value by default </p>

<span class="comment-copy">its false for 0. isn't it nice to be able to check if a number is non zero, or a string non empty, and so on? :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you think it should be <code>False</code> on any of these examples?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because as far as I knew, If i: is equal to if i==1.Isn't it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, it isnt. Here's some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>. So (tl;dr its more close to <code>bool(i)</code> which translates to <code>i !=0</code> for ints. Different languages have different conventions, and you have to be careful assuming things.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"Not comparing it to anything" is incorrect. In a line <code>if x:</code>, <i>x itself</i> is evaluated as a Truthy/Falsy value, and so is equivalent to <code>if bool(x) == True</code>.</span>
