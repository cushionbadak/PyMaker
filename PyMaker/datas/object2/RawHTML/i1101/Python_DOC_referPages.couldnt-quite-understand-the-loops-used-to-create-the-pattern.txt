<p>Can someone explain the loops used here?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>for i in range(0, n):</code> will run the loop 5 time (<code>n</code> being 5), with <code>i</code> being 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. </p>
<p><code>for i in range(n, 0, -1):</code> will also run the loop 5 times, but now backwards (<code>-1</code> being the step argument, meaning 'minus 1' every step. So <code>i</code> wil be 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1. </p>
<p>The function is defined as <code>range([start], stop, [step])</code>. Start is the startnumber of the range (if not specified, it will be 0). Stop is the end of the range, but is not included itself. The 'step' is the size of the steps (default is 1). 
<code>range(2, 10, 2)</code> will for example give you 2, 4, 6 and 8.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Where are you stuck? Have you tried tinkering with the code yourself to figure out what's happening?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">type your code into <code>https://pyfiddle.io/</code> and fiddle with what you do not  understand - maybe you can groke it then</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@wwii I'm sorry, noted. I'm actually new to SO. Will definitely do so in the future. Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I actually understand this part, but what I'm actually facing trouble with is the following: • The usage of the 2nd loop where "J" was implemented. • The [ print(" ") ] statement used at the end of the for loops Thank u so much for ur help it is really appreciated and excuse me if my questions are dumb somehow, I'm new to programming.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As far as I can review the code right now (from mobile), the print(“ “) statement is just to add a blank line between the lines of “&lt;-&gt;”’s.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, you've been very helpful.</span>
