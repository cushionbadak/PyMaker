<p>-1 is not inserting the "hello" at the last index of the array</p>
<p>If I have an array, x:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [1, 2, 3] then
&gt;&gt;&gt; x.insert(-1, "hello")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(x)
[1, 2, 'hello', 3]
</code></pre>
<p>Why -1 is not inserting the "hello" at the last index of the array?
As -1 index is refered to the last item of the list, so I was expecting:</p>
<p>[1, 2, 3, "hello"]</p>

<p>Running <code>help</code> on method will usually give you the answer for these kind of questions:</p>
<pre><code>help(list.insert)
#Help on method_descriptor:
#
#insert(self, index, object, /)
#    Insert object before index.
</code></pre>

<p><code>.append(item)</code> is to append to the end.</p>
<p><code>.insert(index, item)</code> inserts to the place <em>before</em> another item. To "insert" to end, use <code>.insert(len(x), item)</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to add an element in the last using <code>insert()</code> function, then you have to specify the total length as index. You cannot use negative indexes. Negative indexes will start inserting from second last position and before.</p>
<pre><code>x = [1, 2, 3]
x.insert(len(x),'hello')
x
   [1, 2, 3, 'hello']
</code></pre>

<p>From the google's documentation: <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>list.insert(index, elem) -- inserts the element at the given index, shifting elements to the right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Insert should be read as: "insert <em>elem</em> <strong>before</strong> the <strong>index</strong>" in your case: "insert 'hello' before the -1'th element (last element of the list) which is 3".</p>
<p>To insert to the end of the lists you should use list.append(elem) instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>list.append(elem) -- adds a single element to the end of the list. </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So you want to add value at the end of the list. There is two way to add.</p>
<p><strong>- Append:</strong>  As the name says it will append (add) value to the last of the list </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [1,2,3,4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x.append('hello')
&gt;&gt;&gt; x 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 'hello']
</code></pre>
<p><strong>- Insert:</strong> Now in Insert you have to give the position where you want to add the value.
so when you write </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x.insert(len(x),5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
[1, 2, 3, 4, 'hello', 5]
</code></pre>
<p>You are defining as to put value 5 at position <em>len(x) ie 5</em> </p>

<span class="comment-copy">@glibdud: I was not asking "how to insert at the last?" My question was why index with -1 didn't insert the item at the last?(as -1 always refers to the last index of the list)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>x.insert(-1, "hello")</code> this won't work because <b>-1</b> is not an index of an array. If you want to access the last index of the array then you have to specify the array inside the <code>insert()</code> like this... <code>a.insert(a[-1], 'hello')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This seems like more of a helpful comment than an answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@glibdud The question seems to be <code>why</code> rather that <code>how</code> so I believe that the answer stands.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks @iBug.. i got the concept now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please add some explanation</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is not an answer to PO's <code>why</code>. You telling the workaround. Right Answer is given by @oldborn</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your reasoning is based on the false assumption that I am suggesting a work around. The prelude to the code is my answer, in particular the last sentence there and not the code in itself. That is also what @oldborn is alluding to. The code part was just an unnecessary addition, but I guess you focused on the code part, conveniently forgetting to read the text before that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This I believe should be accepted answer as it precisely answers <code>why</code> with valid proofs.</span>
