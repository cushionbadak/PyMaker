<p>I'm trying to print two variables with a for loop from two different lists with an equal amount of values, but when the lists have more than two values I get this error:</p>
<pre><code>ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
</code></pre>
<p>Assume both name and surname lists are the same length (eg. <code>name = ['m', 'y', '.', '.']</code> and <code>surname = ['n', 'a', 'm', 'e']</code>)   </p>
<pre><code>for x,y in name,surname:
    print(x,y)
</code></pre>
<p>My expected result is "my.." and "name" printed next to each other vertically.</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>name = ['m', 'y', '.', '.']

surname = ['n', 'a', 'm', 'e']

for x, y in zip(name, surname):
    print(x, y)

<span class="comment-copy">Your <code>for</code> loop is iterating over a sequence with a length of two: <code>name</code> followed by <code>surname</code>.  Each of those two items gets unpacked into <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, which fails because they contain four elements each.  To iterate the two sequences in parallel, use <code>zip(name, surname)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Go through <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1663807/how-to-iterate-through-two-lists-in-parallel">this</a> post. Everything is in detail</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you explain why how that works? or why the way i did it doesn't</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The documentation for <code>zip()</code> (linked in the answer) explains how it works thoroughly, but just playing with it ought to make it obvious in any case.</span>
