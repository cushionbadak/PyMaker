<p>I'm trying to install this <a href="https://github.com/KonradIT/gopro-py-api" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python GoPro Remote Control API</a> from GitHub.  It's installation instructions say to use PyPi to install it.  As I don't have PyPi, or anything like it as far as I know, installed on my computer, I was wondering if and how you could install something like this manually.  I'd prefer the most if there were just a certain folder I have to put something to install it, but if I have to use Windows Command Line, Powershell, or Python Command Line, I'd be fine with that as well.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You do have <code>pip</code> (the command/module name for the program to interact with PyPi) installed, at least if you are using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 3.4</a>+ (released March 2014) or <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/whatsnew/2.7.html#pep-477-backport-ensurepip-pep-453-to-python-2-7" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 2.7.9</a>+ (released December 2014). And if not it is high time to update.</p>
<p>Just do <code>python -m pip install goprocam</code> in a commandline.</p>
<p>The <code>-m</code> flag tells python to load the module <code>pip</code> and the following arguments are passed along to it.</p>
<p>Depending on your setup you might have to specify the full path to the Python executable.</p>
<p>Have a look <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/29817447/4042267">here</a> for more ways to run <code>pip</code> from the Windows command line.</p>

<p>PyPi is the Python Package Index. It is an online repository of Python packages. It is not something you can download.</p>
<p>What the github page is saying is to download the package from PyPi. </p>
<p>This can be done using Pip. If you have Python, Pip comes with it. Otherwise download Python.</p>
<p>Then in windows command line enter </p>
<pre><code>pip install goprocam
</code></pre>
<p>This command should automatically download the package from PyPi. 
You can also download the package from github, though it it will take a little more time. You need to download/install github, add it to your path and then call</p>
<pre><code>pip install git+githttps://github.com/KonradIT/gopro-py-api.git
</code></pre>
<p>If you get a Pip is not recognized command you will need to add Pip to the environmental variables. This can easily be found online.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't need to use pypi, you can clone the repo and cd into it, and use goprocam module</p>
<pre><code>from goprocam import GoProCamera, constants
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Do it where?  In Command Line?  Or is there some .exe that I'm suppose to run?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ElliotThomas: Yes, in the command line. You might have to specify the full path to the Python executable instead of just writing <code>python</code>, but that depends on your setup.</span>
