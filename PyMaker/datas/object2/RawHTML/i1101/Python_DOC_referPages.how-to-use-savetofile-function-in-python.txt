<p>when I am saving tsvd_uni to tsvd_uni file then it's showing me NameError: name 'savetofile' is not defined</p>
<p>How to correct this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is no default savetofile function in python. If you want to write a function then you can use </p>
<pre><code>def savetofile():
    with open('myfile.py', 'w') as file:
        file.write('whatever')
</code></pre>
<p>And then you can call the function.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python has no savetofile() function, however here is how you do what you are trying to do.</p>
<p>You can either do to completely wipe everything from the file and replace it with what you are trying to write. </p>
<pre><code>f = open('file.txt', 'w')
f.write('whatever data I want')
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the preferred Pythonic way that does the <code>f.close()</code> for you</p>
<pre><code>with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('data)
</code></pre>
<p>If you are trying to append data to the end of the file, then you would switch 'w' with 'a'.</p>
<p>I will show an example of what each of those do.</p>
<p>'w'</p>
<hr/>
<p>text here.</p>
<p>text is now gone.</p>
<p>text is now written in and persisted .</p>
<p>'a'</p>
<hr/>
<p>text is here.</p>
<p>text is added</p>
<p>Pick whichever one you want to save data to a file. Note that if the file doesn't exist, you must either create the file manually or use it by using 'w' the switching to 'a' if you want to append data to the file. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">How is <code>savetofile</code> defined? What library is it from, or have you created it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ooh, it's missing really is my mistake. I forgetting to define 'savetofile' function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fix the indentation after while in your code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there is no while in the code..! @Bazingaa</span>
