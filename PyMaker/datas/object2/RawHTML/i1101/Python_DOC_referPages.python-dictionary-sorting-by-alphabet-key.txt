<p>I'm trying to sort this dictionary <code>a</code> by the key alphabetically. I'm looping through in order, but the dictionary <code>c</code> at the end isn't sorted. I don't understand how python assigns the order of the dictionary key. Why does it maintain the original order? and how do I sort by key alphabetically? </p>
<pre><code>a={'BE': 1, 'BC': 2, 'BO': 3, 'BI': 4, 'BK': 5, 'AQ': 6, 'AS': 7, 'BQ': 8, 'AW': 9, 'AY': 10}

b=sorted(a)

c={}
for i in b:
    print i
    c[i]=a[i]
</code></pre>
<p>I'm using python 2.7</p>

<p>In general, dictionaries/hashtables/hashmaps are unordered. To sort it, you might want to first convert it into a list of tuples or something ordered, then sort on that</p>
<p>As of python3.7 dictionaries are now <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151283.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">insertion-ordered</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">May be a silly question, but you <i>are</i> using python3.6 (or greater), aren't you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">in older python versions dictionary does not keep order, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, dictionaries are not ordered in your version of python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Key's order and dicts are generally not recommend together, you might want to use <code>OrderedDict</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">the obvious choice would be <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OrderedDict</a>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"An OrderedDict is a dict that remembers the order that keys were first inserted" sooooo you'd still need to get it sorted first...?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you'd need to loop over the sorted keys and then insert into the <code>OrderedDict</code>. the result should be something dict-like i figured. or did i misunderstand?</span>
