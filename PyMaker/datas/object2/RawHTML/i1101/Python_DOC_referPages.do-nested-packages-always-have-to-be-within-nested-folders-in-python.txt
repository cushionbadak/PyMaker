<p>Can someone give an example on when you write the following in Python</p>
<pre><code>import p3 from p1.p2
</code></pre>
<p><code>p1</code>, <code>p2</code> are not folders but files. I am trying to understand the <strong>sparsely</strong> documented import system with (confusing ?) docs and (less) examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Packages and importing are well documented in the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>.</p>
<p>Packages can be composed in a hierarchy that does not necessarily reflect a directory structure. In your case, package <code>p1</code> is importing <code>p2</code> which in turn imports <code>p3</code>. All these packages can be in the same directory.</p>
<pre><code># p1.py
import p2 # p2 is now accessible within this package

# p2.py
import p3 # p3 is now accessible within this package

# p3.py
some_variable = 'ding!'
</code></pre>
<p>With this import hierarchy, I can import <code>p1</code> and walk the hierarchy like this</p>
<pre><code>import p1
print p1.p2.p3.some_variable
# ding!
</code></pre>
<p>Or I can import a sub-package from within the hierarchy</p>
<pre><code>from p1 import p2
# or
from p1.p2 import p3
print p3.some_variable
</code></pre>
<p>Directory structures <em>can</em> be used to organize packages more cleanly. A directory can be turned into an importable module by adding an <code>__init__.py</code> file into it. You can do similar importing strategies inside these init files.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Where are you encountering this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The example you gave in the question will result in a syntax error. The correct way to import p3 from p1.p2 would be "from p1.p2 import p3", not "import p3 from p1.p2"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The imports you show are not actually enough to perform imports like <code>from p1.p2 import p3</code>. Also, you have your <code>from</code> imports backward.</span>
