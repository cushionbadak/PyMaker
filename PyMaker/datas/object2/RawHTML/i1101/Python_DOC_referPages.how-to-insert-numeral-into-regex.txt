<p>I'm attempting to insert a numeral between 2 regex groups; however, I can't figure out how to avoid referring to a different group number.</p>
<p>I'm attempting to use regex to update filenames in a directory. Essentially I have a season of a TV show, and all the filenames should follow the pattern "Show - S##E## - Episode Title"</p>
<p>I've written a simple loop to iterate over the files and set up the naming, but the issue I'm running into is that the episode number isn't set up as 2 digits in every file. I've included the loop I tried to use to fix this problem below.</p>
<p>I've tried to use re.sub() to identify the S##E as group 1, and the following digits as group 2, and then insert a '0' between the two groups, but I end up referencing group 10, which isn't defined. I'm not sure how to escape the group reference without referring to group 0 or inserting a backslash.</p>
<pre><code>files = [f for f in os.listdir(os.path.abspath(os.curdir)) if os.path.isfile(f)]
for file in files:
    os.rename(file, re.sub(r'(S\d+E)(\d\s)',r'\10\2',file))
</code></pre>
<p>OR</p>
<pre><code>files = [f for f in os.listdir(os.path.abspath(os.curdir)) if os.path.isfile(f)]
for file in files:
    os.rename(file, re.sub(r'(S\d+E)(\d\s),r'\1'+'0'+r'\2', file))
</code></pre>
<p>Intended results should be for all files to follow the S##E## pattern, even for episode numbers lower than 10. The first version results in an error as I am referring to a group that doesn't exist. The second does not appear to alter the filenames at all.</p>

<p>There's a note about this in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs for <code>re.sub</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>\g&lt;number&gt;</code> uses the corresponding group number; <code>\g&lt;2&gt;</code> is therefore equivalent to <code>\2</code>, but isnâ€™t ambiguous in a replacement such as <code>\g&lt;2&gt;0</code>. <code>\20</code> would be interpreted as a reference to group 20, not a reference to group 2 followed by the literal character '0'. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, write the group reference out in the more verbose way, so it's unambiguous:</p>
<pre><code>os.rename(file, re.sub(r'(S\d+E)(\d\s)',r'\g&lt;1&gt;0\g&lt;2&gt;',file))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I am iterating over an array of files. Each file begins with "Episode #" I'm trying to convert that to "Show - S##E##" and ensure that I use 2 digits to identify the season and episode in that pattern.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I read this page earlier today... Sorry for asking a question I should have known the answer to. Thank you for your help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Happens to everyone. I actually went diving into the python source before I thought to check the docs myself :P</span>
