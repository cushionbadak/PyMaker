<p>There's been "print", ("int" not subscritable) syntax, and so on in this code. The program that I've been trying to do is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a program that asks the user to enter how many numbers are to be averaged. The user can then enter the numbers. The program outputs the total and the mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've tried <code>for i in range</code>, lists and both of them always end up in ("int" not subscriptible) or ("print" syntax's). Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code>x = []
for i in range (2):
  x = int(input("enter a number: "))

for i in range (1):
  Sum = (int(x[0]) + (int(x[1]))

for i in range (1):
         Mean = Sum/2

print ((int(x[0]), "+", (int(x[1])), end = "=", Sum))
print ((int(x[0]), "+", (int(x[1])), end = "=", Sum,"/2 =", Mean))
</code></pre>
<p>Expect the mean and the sum.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are first assigning an empty list to x:</p>
<pre><code>x = []
</code></pre>
<p>And then you assign a single int (twice):</p>
<pre><code>for i in range (2):
    x = int(input("enter a number: "))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>1: x = []</p>
<p>2: x = first user input</p>
<p>3: x = second user input</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What you want to do is append the user input to the list in x.</p>
<p>Either like this:</p>
<pre><code>x.append(int(input("enter a number: ")))
</code></pre>
<p>Or like this:</p>
<pre><code>x += [int(input("enter a number: "))]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>[]</code> in the second example are required to add (<code>+</code>) lists together as you can not add a list and a value but you can add two lists in terms of appending one to the  other.</p>
<p>You could also use list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>x = [int(input("enter a number: ")) for i in range(2)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the Built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sum()</a> to get the sum of elements in a list.</p>
<pre><code>x=[int(input("enter a number: ")) for count in range(2)]
print (x[0], "+", x[1],"=", sum(x))
print (x[0], "+", x[1],"=", sum(x),"/2 =", sum(x)/2)
</code></pre>
<p>Output</p>
<pre><code>enter a number: 23
enter a number: 43
23 + 43 = 66
23 + 43 = 66 /2 = 33.0
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Don't just describe the approximate error, give a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> with proper formatting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>x = []</code> does not do anything because x gets rewritten to an int here <code>x = int(input("enter a number: "))</code> . When you get to the print statement, x is an <code>int</code>, and so <code>x[0]</code> is an error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, <code>for i in range (1):</code> is the equivalent of "do the following one time". It can be eliminated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As there are almost as many errors as lines here, voting to close as "too broad".</span>
