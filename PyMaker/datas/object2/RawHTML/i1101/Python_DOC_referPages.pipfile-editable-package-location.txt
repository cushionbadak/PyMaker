<p>I'm able to have the source files I'm working on installed to an editable package directory following the instructions <a href="https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics/#editable-dependencies-e-g-e" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>So my pipenv looks like</p>
<pre><code>[dev-packages]
pytest = "*"
my-package= {editable = true, path = "."}
</code></pre>
<p>This allows me to run</p>
<pre><code>pipenv install --dev
</code></pre>
<p>then </p>
<pre><code>pytest
</code></pre>
<p>to test.</p>
<p>Is it possible to put my package into in <code>./src</code>? I've tried that and I'm told the path is invalid. </p>
<pre><code>ValueError: Invalid path './src'
</code></pre>
<p>*After Carlo's answer + the improvement from hoefling 
Here's a project that verified Carlo's answer

<p>In order to be able install a path as editable, it needs to be a package and that means you need to have a <code>setup.py</code> file in that directory.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Don't shoot the messenger, but you've accepted the wrong answer. Instead of moving the setup script to <code>src</code>, making it the new project root, you should map the source root in the setup script correctly. <code>setup(name="alan_pytridge", packages=find_packages(where='src'), package_dir={'': 'src'})</code> is already sufficient. Check out the docs for detailed explanation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#listing-whole-packages" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Listing whole packages</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That works too, thanks. I'll read up the link you have provided. <a href="https://github.com/ollyjshaw/alan_pytridge/commit/7c7b1b3288fd77683a45de438e6d51704fc63388" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/ollyjshaw/alan_pytridge/commit/â€¦</a></span>
