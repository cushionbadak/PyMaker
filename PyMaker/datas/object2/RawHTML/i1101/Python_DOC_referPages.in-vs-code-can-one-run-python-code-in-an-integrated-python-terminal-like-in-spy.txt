<p>Currently, in Visual Studio Code (under Windows 10 64bits), at a Python file called <code>path\myfile.py</code>, if one clicks with mouse right-button for context menu and then chooses 'Run Python File in Terminal', an integrated CMD terminal is open and file is automatically run there with:</p>
<pre><code>python.exe path\myfile.py
</code></pre>
<p>After the file stops running, one is naturally left at the integrated CMD cursor.</p>
<p>This behavior is quite different, for instance, from what one has with an IDE like Spyder. There, when you run code (e.g. with <code>F5</code>), at the end one is left still at the Python cursor and can access content of variables created when code was run.</p>
<p>Is there a way to achieve a similar behavior in Visual Studio Code?</p>

<p>Yes. Open a terminal window and it's like a terminal window on your computer. You can type <code>python filepathandname</code> and the python script will execute like it does from the command line. </p>

<p>The closest you can come is to run the code under the debugger and set a breakpoint at the end to pause the exiting of the execution.

<span class="comment-copy">@UnholySheep I know that is an option if I run python code from a CMD terminal directly. Question is: in case that solves the problem, how to configure Visual Studio Code to send files to terminal with such an option enabled?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The (probably) best way would be to create a custom launch configuration: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/â€¦</a> (and then launch using <code>F5</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But then you can't send code from the editor to that terminal.</span>
