<p>I Want to Loop over string and find count which for those which are greater than 3.0 </p>
<pre><code>rainfall_mi = "1.65, 1.46, 2.05, 3.03, 3.35, 3.46, 2.83, 3.23, 3.5, 2.52, 2.8, 1.85"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try this:</p>
<pre><code>len([float(i) for i in rainfall_mi.split(',') if float(i)&gt; 3.0])
</code></pre>
