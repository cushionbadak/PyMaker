<p>Very new to Python.I would like to return the first work from an input string that starts with a vowel. If found return the word, else return an empty string. Have the below code however the else statement doesn't seems to work.</p>
<pre><code>for word in string_list:
    if word[0] in ['a','e','i','o','u']:
        return word
    else:
        return ""
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your code, the for loop will execute only once if you are using it inside the function because you are just checking the first word and returning from the function. Instead, you can use only <code>if</code> condition inside the for loop and returning empty string part outside the for loop.</p>
<p>And you also need to check with small and capital letters/vowels. string_list here is the list of strings.</p>
<pre><code>def findFirstWordWithVowel(string_list):
    for word in string_list:
        if word[0] in "aeiouAEIOU":
            return word
    return ""
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You only <code>return</code> inside a function, for example:</p>
<pre><code>string_list = ['frst', 'hello', 'and']


def first_with_vowel(words):
    vowels = 'aeiou'
    for word in words:
        if any(vowel == word[0] for vowel in vowels):
            return word
    return ""


print(first_with_vowel(string_list))    
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<pre><code>and
</code></pre>
<p>To verify if any of the vowels is the first letter of a word you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer">any</a>. The function any evals to <code>True</code> if any of vowels is the first letter of the word.</p>
<p>Also in your code the <code>else</code> is misplaced, if the first word does not start with a vowel you will return <code>""</code>, even if the second does. You can remove the else, and return <code>""</code> when the loop is over (like in the example code above), meaning there was no word that started with a vowel.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>return should be used in a function. so,</p>
<pre><code>def checker(word):
    if word[0] in ['a','e','i','o','u']:
         return word
    else:
         return ""

checker("isuru")
</code></pre>
<p>this works.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you actually defined a function (using <code>def</code>) anywhere?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you show your whole code? Your logic is correct but the placement of the <code>return</code> indicates you want this to be a function. You should also want to store your results into a <code>list</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have defined the function as def first_starting_vowel(string_list):</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, in this particular case I been asked to check only the lower case. Thank you all</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks so much , I will try</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Seems to be a better answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the purpose of string_list in your function? If it is a list (which is not defined in your function), you are only executing the for loop once.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">def first_starting_vowel(string_list):</span>
