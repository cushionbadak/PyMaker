<p>I made a dataframe from a bigger dataframe with a for loop and and the group by function. The multiindexed dataframe has the name 'Area' for all columns and the second level for all columns is called 'mean'. I am indexing the columns by iloc and wanted to give them names based on a different dataframe. </p>
<p>Could you help me out? If you have a completely different approach I am thankful too, of course.</p>
<pre><code>bis=len(index_df['amount'])
for c, d in zip (index_df['amount'], (bis)): 
    num[c] = num.iloc[:,[d]]
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following error message:
'TypeError: zip argument #2 must support iteration'</p>

<p>You can't iterate over an integer, but you can iterate over a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>range</code></a> object, e.g. <code>range(len(index_df.index))</code>. But, in any case, <code>=</code> in Pandas is used for assignment, not for renaming, unless you combine it with <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.pop.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pd.DataFrame.pop</code></a>.</p>
<p>If each column of <code>num</code> relates to a value in <code>index_df['amount']</code>, and the relation is aligned by integer position, you can simply use assignment:</p>
<pre><code>num.columns = index_df['amount']
</code></pre>
<p>And that's it, no manual iteration involved.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you want to happen when you <code>zip</code> over a <i>number</i> like <code>bis</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">bis is 4 and the dataframe has 4 columns. I wanted to index every single column and rename it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much! That helped me a lot. That again underlines that I am coding on a very low level. Haha But still, how would it work with iterations? I didn't use range because (to my knowledge) I cannot iterate over two columns...</span>
