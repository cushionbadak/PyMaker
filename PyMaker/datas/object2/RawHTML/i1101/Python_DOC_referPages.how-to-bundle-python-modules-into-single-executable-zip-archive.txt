<p>Its been quite a while since I wrote any serious python code so I'm sure I'm just missing something stupid...</p>
<p>I've written several modules and would like to bundle them into a single executable zip archive. I seem to remember this being a relatively trivial process and thought I had it working but after a few additions, renaming directories/files, etc. I'm unable to make heads or tails of the steady tide of errors.</p>
<p>While researching the question, I came across a number of hits for packaging with the preverbal Cheeseshop (<code>pip</code>), <code>py2exe</code>, <code>py2app</code>, etc. However, I have no intention of redistributing my code online and don't necessarily need to bundle the entire python environment. </p>
<p>What is the easiest and simplest method for bundling my modules into a single cross platform (mostly unix/linux/mac environment) executable?</p>
<p>Example Structure:</p>
<pre><code>ProjectRoot
    |_ sub_dir
        |_ __init__.py # empty file
        |_ module1.py
        |_ module2.py
    |_ __main__.py
</code></pre>
<p>Contents of <code>__main__.py</code> :</p>
<pre><code>import sub_dir.module1 as sss
sss.main()
</code></pre>
<p>I attempted to create a zip archive of the <code>ProjectRoot</code> but when executing the archive I get the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ python ./ProjectRoot.zip
/usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.7: can't find '__main__' module in './ProjectRoot.zip'    
</code></pre>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Try using the <code>zipapp</code> module:</p>
<pre><code>$ python -m zipapp myapp -m "myapp:main"
$ python myapp.pyz
</code></pre>
