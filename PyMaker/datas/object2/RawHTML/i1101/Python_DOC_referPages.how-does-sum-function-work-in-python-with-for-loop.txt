<p>I was using sum function in pyhton, and i am clear about it's general structure <b>sum(iterable, start)</b>  , but i am unable to get the logic behind the following code</p>
<pre><code>test = sum(5 for i in range(5) )
print("output:  ", test) 
</code></pre>
<p>output:  25</p>
<p>Please can anyone describe what is happening here, basically here 5 is getting multiplied with 5, and same pattern is there for every sample input.</p>

<p>Your code is shorthand for:</p>
<pre><code>test = sum((5 for i in range(5)))
</code></pre>
<p>The removal of extra parentheses is syntactic sugar: it has no impact on your algorithm.</p>
<p>The <code>(5 for i in range(5))</code> component is a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">generator expression</a> which, on each iteration, yields the value 5. Your generator expression has 5 iterations in total, as defined by <code>range(5)</code>. Therefore, the generator expression yields 5 exactly 5 times.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code></a>, as the docs indicate, accepts any <em>iterable</em>, even those <em>not</em> held entirely in memory. Generators, and by extension generator expressions, are memory efficient. Therefore, your logic will sum 5 exactly 5 times, which equals 25.</p>
<p>A convention when you don't use a variable in a closed loop is to denote that variable by underscore (<code>_</code>), so usually you'll see your code written as:</p>
<pre><code>test = sum(5 for _ in range(5))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can add a list to the <code>sum</code> function so you can make something like this:</p>
<pre><code>test = sum((1,23,5,6,100))
print("output:  ", test) 
</code></pre>
<p>And you get <code>135</code>. </p>
<p>So with your "for loop" you get a list and put that list to the <code>sum</code> function and you get the sum of the list. The real <code>sum</code> function uses yield insight and use every value and sum them up. </p>

<p>Basically, it is summing 5 repeativily for every "i" on range(5). Meaning, this code is equivalent to n*5, being n the size of range(n).</p>
