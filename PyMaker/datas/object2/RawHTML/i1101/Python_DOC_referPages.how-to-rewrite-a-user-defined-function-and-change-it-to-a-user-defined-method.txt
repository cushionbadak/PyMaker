<p>I have a user defined function in the code below. Is there a way for me to re-write it with different syntax where I don't use brackets around the variable I want but rather have the function as a method such as .printfunction. Is there a way using classes and methods to rewrite the function as a method rather than a user-defined function?</p>
<p>The desired output needs to be xY . </p>
<pre><code>def printfunction(var2):
    return "x" + var2

printfunction("Y")

def printfunction(var2):
    return "x" + var2

#Desired Syntax
var1 = "x"
var1.printfunction("Y")

<p>I'm not sure what version of python you are running on but this one works for me.</p>
<pre><code>class String():
    def __init__(self,str):
        self.str = str
    def printfunction(self,append_this):
        print(self.str + append_this)


var1 = String('x')
var1.printfunction('Y')

<p>Thanks to the advice from @grayson and @Patrick Artner. I am able to answer my question </p>
<pre><code>class Strgcust(str):
     def printfunction(self, var1):
             return (self + var1)

var1 = Strgcust("x")

var1.printfunction(str("Y"))

<span class="comment-copy">You have to create a class and make that function a class method.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do I do that? I am relatively new to python and am really confused. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"<i>I am relatively new to python</i>": Learn one bit at a time. Online courses, textbooks, tutorials. That's the only proper way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not sure why anyone would downvote this question. Check here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4699179/add-custom-method-to-string-object" title="add custom method to string object">stackoverflow.com/questions/4699179/…</a> for a better answer than I can give but in essence, you can't (in Python) override a string in the way you want. You can create a new class as @DYZ says and the link should help.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">3.5.5 . Thanks @Baby , your code works too!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python has a built-in module named <code>string</code>, so it would be a good idea to name your class something else—<code>String</code> would avoid the problem and be in accordance with the advice in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 8 - Naming Conventions</a> which says class names should have their first letter Capitalized.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @martineau . I have amended my code.</span>
