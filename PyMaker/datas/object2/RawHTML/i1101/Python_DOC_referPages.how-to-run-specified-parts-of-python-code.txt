<p>I need to know if there is a command that allows you to execute specific lines of a larger script in python. Do insert an if at the beginning of the script like this (pseudocode, values is an input parameter). 
I do not want to insert the whole script inside the conditions because the code would be too long and because there are other conditions.</p>
<pre><code>if values ​​== x:
     execute lines 1,2,3
else:
     execute lines 4,5,6
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would definitely try creating a function for each group of lines. This can be done like so:</p>
<pre><code>def name_of_function1():
    line of code 1
    line of code 2
    line of code 3

def name_of_function2():
    line of code 4
    line of code 5
    line of code 6
</code></pre>
<p>You can then call the functions later in your program like so:</p>
<pre><code>if values ​​== x:
   name_of_function1()
else:
   name_of_function2()
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not put those "lines" into functions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">or put them into the python console if you just want to "test" something fast</span>
<span class="comment-copy">or split them into modules for later use and better maintenance.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"command that allows you to execute specific lines" Yes, they are called "functions" <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could just write Functions and call them when required.</span>
