<p>Ques:<br/>
Given the list <code>kkr_runs = [4, 10, 12, 1, 28, 0, 31, 2, 6, 2, 4]</code><br/>
It should print:</p>
<p>"good job" if the score is more than 30<br/>
"You can do better" if the score is greater than 20 but less than 30<br/>
"Ok you did something" if the score is more than 10 and less than or equal to 20<br/>
"Duck" if it's 0<br/>
"Come on!" if it's more than 0 and less than or equal to 10</p>
<p>I am printing the following code but getting wrong results?</p>
<pre><code>kkr_runs = [4, 10, 12, 1, 28, 0, 31, 2, 6, 2, 4]
r=[]
for i in kkr_runs:

    if i&gt;30:
        print(i,"good job")
    elif i&gt;20 &amp; i&lt;30:
        print(i,"YOu can do better")
    elif i&gt;10 &amp; i&lt;=20:
        print(i,"Ok you did something")
    elif i==0:
        print(i,"Duck")
    else:
        print(i,"Come on")
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, logical AND is denoted by <code>and</code>.
Do something like this,</p>
<pre><code>kkr_runs = [4, 10, 12, 1, 28, 0, 31, 2, 6, 2, 4]
r=[] 
for i in kkr_runs:
    if i&gt;30:
        print(i,"good job")
    elif i&gt;20 and i&lt;30:
        print(i,"YOu can do better")
    elif i&gt;10 and i&lt;=20:
        print(i,"Ok you did something")
    elif i==0:
        print(i,"Duck")
    else:
        print(i,"Come on")
</code></pre>
<p>Output: </p>
<pre><code>4 Come on
10 Come on
12 Ok you did something
1 Come on
28 YOu can do better
0 Duck
31 good job
2 Come on
6 Come on
2 Come on
4 Come on

<p>Use this code:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@Nick please accept this answer if this worked well for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NiklasMertsch yes this is short code but does it affect performance ? If it does't, then both are same.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Both do the same and even if there is a performance difference, it would be irrelevant for this type or program. I pointed it out because of better readability.</span>
