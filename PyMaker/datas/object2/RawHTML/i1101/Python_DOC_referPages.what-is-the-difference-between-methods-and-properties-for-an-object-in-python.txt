<p>Suppose i have a data-frame object named as df, head() is a method that can be applied to df to see the first 5 records of the data-frame and df.size is a property to get the size of the data-frame. </p>
<p>For the property we are not using '()' as we used for a method. This was little confusing initially. 
Could anyone explain whats basic difference between a property and a method in python. I mean why we had to define size as a property for a dataframe, why not it was defined as a method which would have just returned the size of the data-frame. </p>

<p>So I thought I'd link you to this answer because I think this explains it pretty well.</p>

<p>If I had to explain it in my own words, properties are the 'attributes' of the object that have methods (get, set and delete).</p>
<p>So, if I understand correctly, <em>df.size</em> will be your property and then you need to define get, set and delete methods for this property. Also, I would recommend reading through the python class docs just to get proper usage and definitions.</p>

<p>Here in the above example you mentioned, you can pass argument to <code>df.head()</code> function, where as you cannot pass arguments for properties.
for same above example, if you have written <code>df.head(20)</code> it would return first 20 rows.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! Does it mean, properties are defined when no argument are expected for some operation on an object? And if some arguments are expected we define a method?</span>
