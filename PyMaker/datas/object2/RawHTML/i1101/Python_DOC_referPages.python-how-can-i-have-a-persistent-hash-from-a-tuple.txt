<p>I need to generate a hash from a tuple. Ideally I would have liked to able to do it from a list, but that's not possible. I need something that I can use the hash to generate back the tuple, to finally access the original list with the items in the right order (items will be strings).</p>
<p>Here's what I'm trying to hash</p>
<pre><code>l = ['x', 'y', 'z']
t = tuple(l)
</code></pre>
<p>I tried using <code>hash()</code>, but that ended up not giving the same hash across Python sessions, which is something I need.</p>
<p>I need the hash because I want to create a file based off that list with the hash as the filename. I then want to lookup the file name and be able to access the list items (in the correct order) using just the hash.</p>
<p>My understanding is that this is possible, but I could be wrong. Any ideas?</p>

<p>You can use MD5, which is fast, and will always give you the same result for the same input.</p>
<pre><code>import hashlib

def get_filename()
m = hashlib.md5()
for s in t:
    m.update(s)
fn = m.hexdigest() # =&gt; 'd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e'
</code></pre>
<p>As user2357112 says, you cannot reconstruct <code>l</code> from <code>fn</code>; but if <code>l</code> was saved in a file that bears the MD5 hash, you will be able to read it.</p>

<p>No, this is not possible if your tuple contains strings and with the builtin <code>hash()</code>.</p>
<p>The hash of strings are intentionally made variable across Python sessions, because in Python 3.4, it led to a potential security issue (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0456/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 456</a>). In Python 3.5, this was fixed by making hashes of strings different in every Python session.</p>
<p>I recommend that you create a hashing function of your own so it's stable, or use some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>hashlib</code></a>.</p>

<p>Hash is theoretically irreversible. Encrypt seems to be want you want. For example, base64</p>
<p>==================
<strong>update</strong></p>
<p>base64 is encode technology.<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28836837/is-base64-an-encryption-or-encoding-algorithm">enter link description here</a></p>
<p>Maybe encrypt or encode is want you want.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"I need something that I can use the hash to generate back the tuple" - then what you need isn't a hash. Hashes aren't designed to let you recover the original input.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fair enough, what should I look into then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112: Maybe it's the wording. The "In need the hash..." paragraph describes the use case better: hash as filename to retrieve the stored value from the file where the value is saved.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That last part was it, saving <code>l</code> inside of the file seems to be the way to go. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, It's encode and decode</span>
