<p>grid.csv is file containing grid of 20*20 integers.
the output prints a list with each element in separate line. I tried this </p>
<pre><code>grid = list(map(lambda s: s.strip('\n'),grid))
</code></pre>
<p>but the output was still in separate lines</p>

<p>A simple:</p>
<pre><code>with open("grid.csv", "r") as f:
    grid = [item for line in f for item in line.split()]
</code></pre>
<p>Will give you a 1D list of your 2D data, provided that your integer grid in the <code>grid.csv</code> is indeed whitespace-separated. You can verify it by simply joining back the list with a space:</p>
<pre><code>print(" ".join(grid))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">A &lt;map at 0x7f2317b270f0&gt; output means that the return is a map not a list, simply surround it by list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">second line is not valid because a list doesn't have that method (clear), check <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">surrounding by list returned same output i.e. in separate lines</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Juan it does in python 3 though <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes it is in white space. now I've got all the integers in single line in a list using <code>list = [(" ".join(grid))]</code> still they are separated in with white space so couldnt be iterated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@anon-bee-01 - If you want to iterate over them, just don't join them - they are already separated as a 1D list in the <code>grid</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">List will be still in 2D. I tried strip \n but still it's in 2D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay I do have in 1D now. Thanks @zwer</span>
