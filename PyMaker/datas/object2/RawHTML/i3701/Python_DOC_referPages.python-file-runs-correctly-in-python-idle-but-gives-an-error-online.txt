<span class="comment-copy">The error is the same for the dupe, the reasons are different - the solutions as well. I dont think the answers there will lead to solving this one, so providing answere here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sir, i got the upper code correctly(saving into dictionary) but while recalling from dictionary...all the queries are given in one go...and comp. should keep on reading  the queries till stop entering(each query in next line) and then it should show me results.In above case it's just showing me result just after a single query. Kindly help me out with this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Raghav Your question is 100% from <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-dictionaries-and-maps/problem" rel="nofollow noreferrer">30-dictionaries-and-maps/problem</a> - this is a solution for this problem. I do not quite get what you mean with upper/lower part. This solution will ask for input while input is given (if finished reading input EOFError is triggered, then it stops). It will print for each input either the <i>key=value</i> (name=telephone) or <i>Not found</i>. The solution to your problem is simply catching the error that is created when the last input() tries to caputre something but nothing is given.</span>
