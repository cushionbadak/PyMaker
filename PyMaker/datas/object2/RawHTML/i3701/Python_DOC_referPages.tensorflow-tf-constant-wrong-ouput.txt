<p>The <code>b</code> before a string is not part of the string, but instead, denotes that it is stored as bytes. In Python 3.x, <code>bytes</code> and <code>string</code> objects are different (even though you can easily convert from one to the other).</p>
<p>So, <code>b'hello'</code> means that the string <code>hello</code> is being represented as bytes; this is the same as the string you inputted.</p>
<p>You can convert this value back to a string by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>bytes.decode()</code></a>, as <code>tf.constant().decode('ascii')</code>.</p>
