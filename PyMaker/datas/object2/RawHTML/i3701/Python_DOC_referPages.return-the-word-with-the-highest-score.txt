<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've been trying to define a function that returns the word with the highest score. Firstly, I made a dictionary (because there are letters who have no punctuation and others have the same). So, imagine I have best(["Babel", "Xadrez"]). It is supposed to return "Xadrez", because it has 21 points against the 10 points of the other word, but I'm not getting it.
This is my code by now:</p>
<pre><code>def best(lista):

  dic = {'D':2, 'C':2, 'L':2, 'P':2, 'B':3, 'N':3, 'F':4, 'G':4,
   'H':4, 'V':4, 'J':5, 'Q':6, 'X':8, 'Y':8, 'Z':8}

 for i in range(len(lista)):
     if lista[i] &gt;= 'A' and lista[i] &lt;= 'Z':
        lista.append(lista[i])
 return lista

 txt = lista

 soma1 = 0
 soma2 = 0
 soma3 = 0
 for palavra in txt:
     soma1 = soma1 + dic.get(palavra, 0)

 for palavra in txt:
     soma2 = soma2 + dic.get(palavra, 0)

 for palavra in txt:
     soma3 = soma3 + dic.get(palavra, 0)

#I think the problem starts here, because we don't know where the next
 #word starts neither how many words there are
 if soma1 &gt; soma2 and soma1 &gt; soma3:
   return soma1
 elif soma2 &gt; soma1 and soma2 &gt; soma3:
   return soma2
 else:
   return soma3
#I know that this returns the punctuation of the word instead of the 
 #word itself, but I did it for just a reason: if the code was right
 #it would be easy to return the word
 #Thanks.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can simplify this <code>best</code> function by factoring out the code to score a word. I'm not sure exactly what you're trying to do, so this might be oversimplified for your actual problem, but it should be enough to get you going:</p>
<pre><code>def score(word):
    dic = {'D':2, 'C':2, 'L':2, 'P':2, 'B':3, 'N':3, 'F':4, 'G':4, 'H':4, 'V':4, 'J':5, 'Q':6, 'X':8, 'Y':8, 'Z':8}
    total = 0
    for char in word:
        total += dic.get(char.upper(), 0)
    return total
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if you have a list of words, you can use that <code>score</code> function as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#key-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">key function</a> and just pass it to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>max</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>def best(lista):
    return max(lista, key=score)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The simplest way to write this is to write a simpler function that returns the score  of a word, and then use it as a key function, so all you need is <code>def best(lista): return max(lista, key=score_of_word)</code>.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Shouldn't <code>xadrez</code> only score 18 points?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I forgot @chrisz others worth 1 point</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So then shouldn't you be using <code>dic.get(letter, 1)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks so much @abarnet !!! I was trying now by that way, but wasn't getting it! I think I got now the basic of the dictionaries in Python! Thanks!</span>
