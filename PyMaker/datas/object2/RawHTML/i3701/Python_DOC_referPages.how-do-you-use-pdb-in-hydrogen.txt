<p>I am new to debugging in Python, and I currently use Hydrogen within Atom to do most of my Python work. I have looked into debugging, and it seems that the Python package <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pdb</code></a> is the standard way to debug in Python. Most of the examples I can find seem to require using a command line on a <code>.py</code> file. However, in Hydrogen I would want to run it within the kernel on individual lines of the code, since I don't think <code>pdb</code> will work on a markdown (<code>.md</code>) file. Is there a way I can debug within my workflow, or do I need to make <code>.py</code> files of my code and run <code>pdb</code> on them?</p>

<p>I had read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/37903700/4521071">this answer</a> and tried to implement "C. From Within Your Program". It had thrown errors, and I gave up. However, I went to <a href="https://pymotw.com/2/pdb/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the source</a> that the answer had cited, and used this code:</p>
<pre><code>import pdb

class MyObj(object):

    def __init__(self, num_loops):
        self.count = num_loops

    def go(self):
        for i in range(self.count):
            pdb.set_trace()
            print(i)
        return

if __name__ == '__main__':
    MyObj(5).go()
</code></pre>
<p>From this, I was able to get <code>pdb</code> to run in Hydrogen.</p>
