<p>I want to make a program that remembers something and can show it later on - like A.I. </p>
<p>First , I show the program the question, like "How are you today?" and I also teach it the answer "Fine , you?", something like that.</p>
<p>Second, when I ask the program "How are you today?" or "How are you?", it should know the answer.</p>
<p>So far, I have this:</p>
<pre><code>    print ("Salut ! Am nevoie de ajutorul tau sa invat cateva propozitii...")
print ("Crezi ca ma poti ajuta ?")
answer1 = input("da/nu")

if (answer1=="da"):
  print ("Bun , acum tu poti sa pui intrebarea si raspunsul")
  print ("Spre exemplu , Primul lucru la inceput de linie trebuie sa fie intrebarea urmata de *?* ")
  print ("Apoi , raspunsul pe care eu trebuie sa il dau.")
  print ("Exemplu : Intrebare= Ce faci ? Raspuns= Bine , mersi :D")
question= "asd"
while (question != "stop"):
  question = input("The question: ")
  answer = input("The answer= ")
</code></pre>
<p>What should I do to be able to Store the question, the answer for the respective question, then, when I input something like "Password" or any specific word to be able to test if it knows to reply my questions?</p>

<p>Try a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionary</a> data structure. This structure allows fast retrieval of a value (answer) given a key (question). Here's a sample program and output:</p>
<pre><code># dictionary to store the question-answer pairs
qa = {}

# store a series of question/answer pairs
while 1:
    question = input("add a question (or q to quit): ")

    if question == "q": 
        break

    answer = input("add the answer: ")
    qa[question] = answer

print("...")

# now quiz your program
while 1:
    question = input("ask me a question (or q to quit): ")

    if question == "q": 
        break
    elif question in qa:
        print(qa[question])
    else:
        print("i'm not sure...")

<p>You can use <em>dictionaries</em>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Will the program continue to run? If so, why not just store questions and answers in a variable, e.g. a dictionary, and retrieve the answers from there?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks . I have one more question . How do i store them to work in another session ? Not teach it every time ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can pickle the dictionary and write it to a file, then retrieve it from file on each program run: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19201290/how-to-save-a-dictionary-to-a-file" title="how to save a dictionary to a file">stackoverflow.com/questions/19201290/â€¦</a></span>
