<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was trying to apply what others have suggested from here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17683475/beautiful-soup-accessing-li-elements-from-ul-with-no-id">Beautiful Soup: Accessing &lt;li&gt; elements from &lt;ul&gt; with no id</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I can't get it to work. It seems the person from that question had a 
'parent' <code>h2</code> header, but the one I am trying to parse does not.</p>
<p>Here is the webpage I am scraping:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://nvd.nist.gov/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I think) I located the element I need to manipulate, it's <code>&lt;ul id="latestVulns"&gt;</code> and its following <code>li</code> sections. </p>
<p>I basically want to scrape for the section that says "Last 20 Scored Vulnerability IDs &amp; Summaries" and based off of what the vulnerabilities are, send an email to the appropriate department of my work place.</p>
<p>Here is my code so far:</p>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

source = requests.get('https://nvd.nist.gov/')
soup = BeautifulSoup(source.content, 'lxml')

section = soup.find('latestVulns')
print(section)
</code></pre>
<p>this code returns None</p>
<p>I'm at a loss</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The first argument of <code>find</code> expects the name of the element and you are passing in the <code>id</code>.</p>
<p>You can use this to find the tag correctly</p>
<pre><code>section = soup.find('ul', {'id': 'latestVulns'})
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">you need to do : find(id='latestVulns')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">find specifies element to find such as ul, not an attribute. If you wanna find element by id use <code>soup.find('ul', {'id':'latestVulns'})</code></span>
