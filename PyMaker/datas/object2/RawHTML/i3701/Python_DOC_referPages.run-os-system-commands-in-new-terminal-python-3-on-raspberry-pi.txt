<p>I am running a program which runs terminal codes based on the input recieved by the user on my Raspberry Pi. I want the process to run on a different terminal which is opened by my python code. 
For this on my Ubuntu machine I did</p>
<pre><code>os.system("gnome-terminal -x google-chrome") #if i wanted to open chrome
</code></pre>
<p>But this is not an option on raspbian stretch. I want to know how I can perform similar functions on my raspberry pi</p>
<p>I had asked a similar question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50344490/run-os-system-commands-on-a-new-terminal-python-3">here</a>. Refer to it to get a better understanding of what I am asking</p>
<p>I have Python 3.5.3 on the Raspberry Pi model 2 B running Raspbian Stretch</p>

<p>It sounds you do not necessarily want to spawn a new terminal emulator to run a process from, but just want that the process runs side-by-side with your Python code. You can spawn new processes in a more flexible way than <code>os.system</code> with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess</code></a> module.</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.Popen("google-chrome", stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
# Python code continues executing as soon as the process is spawned
print("Hello, World!")
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> arguments state that the output should be discarded (i.e. redirected to <code>/dev/null</code>).</p>
<p>Note that by default <code>Popen</code> does not use the shell to run your command. If you want to emulate the behaviour of <code>os.system</code> more closely, use <code>shell=True</code> as an argument to <code>Popen</code>. As with <code>os.system</code> this can have security implications!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "run on a different terminal"? Are you bothered by the output of Chrome in Python's terminal? Or do you want that the Python code continues running side-by-side with Chrome?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need the python code running side by side. because when I open chrome(or any other application) it starts on the same terminal as the python code,which prevents me from giving further input to the code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think it is not working in Raspberry Pi because there is no <code>gnome-terminal</code> installed. You can try replace it with <code>os.system("LXTerminal -x google-chrome")</code>. I never try this since I don't use GUI on my Raspberry Pi.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried doing "lxterminal -x" but it didn't work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It worked, thanks. Though i needed to add  <code>shell=True</code> in the Popen</span>
