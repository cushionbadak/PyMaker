<p>Let's say I have a list of four values. I want to find all combinations of two of the values. For example, I would like to get an output like:</p>
<pre><code>((0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3))
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, I do not want repetitions, for example (0, 1) and (1, 0)</p>
<p>This needs to be able to be used with larger numbers, not just 4, and I will have to iterate through all of the combos</p>
<p>I am using Python 3 and Windows, and this would ideally be an inbuilt function, a simple bit of list comprehension code, or something I can import. I have tried making this with range, but I do not know how to exclude the numbers that I have already done from it. </p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>It is very easy</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import combinations
list(combinations([0,1,2,3],2))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Take just the lower triangular matrix if you only need a distinct set</p>
<pre><code>a = [1,2,10,20]
[(a[i], a[j+i+1]) for i in range(len(a))  for j in range(len(a[i+1:]))]

[(1, 2), (1, 10), (1, 20), (2, 10), (2, 20), (10, 20)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">combinations from itertools</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok sure, but did you give a chance to actually search for this problem in advance or do you assume the question is new? Do you have problems with a specific line in your code? <code>from itertools import combinations</code> and <code>for i in combinations(range(4),2): print(i)</code> would be enough to create a generator and loop it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner I agree. However I did not find any good explaining answer to this question. It might be that the basics of it is already well-documented.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry for the sloppy editing, it was my first post</span>
<span class="comment-copy">NP, just mark all your code and hit <b>{}</b> this will mostly solve editing if you straight copy/paste from your editor</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think I fixed it now</span>
