<p>Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the list. Note: I don't want to use min and max function.. [10,3,5,6] - 7 , [7,2,10,9] - 8 </p>
<pre><code>our_list = []
numbers=int(input("enter numbers").strip()) 
our_list.append(numbers) 
our_list.sort() 
print (our_list)  
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my logic, first I will display the list of the inputted value and then I will use sort method to sort the list to find the min and max number from the list and then I will deduct from the max to min number but I am not able to achieve the result, Here is my code so far.. </p>
<p>The above code is not even sorting the numbers thus not able to move ahead,  please help. </p>

<p>The main issue is you need to split by whitespace (or another delimiter) in order for a user to submit multiple numbers via a single <code>input</code>.</p>
<p>Since <code>str.split()</code> splits by whitespace and returns a <code>list</code>, you can <code>map</code> each element to <code>int</code> and pass to <code>sorted</code>. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code># retrieve string input
input_str = input('Enter numbers separated by whitespace:\n')

# split by whitsepace, convert to integer, then sort
numbers = sorted(map(int, input_str.split()))

# calculate difference between last and first items
res = numbers[-1] - numbers[0]

# display / print result  
print(res) 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A variation in your approach could be using an endless loop in which numbers are input until 'exit' typed by the user.</p>
<pre><code>our_list = []
i = 0
while i&gt;= 0:
    numbers = input("enter numbers") 
    if numbers == 'exit':
        break
    our_list.append(int(numbers)) 
print our_list.sort() 
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>numbers=int(input("enter numbers").strip())</code> is not doing at all what i think you think it is doing. I would recommend looking at <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_strip.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list</a> documentation to better understand</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sam ok sure, I am going to read that again</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@martineau because I am learning and I want to explore different ways to achieve the results...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I got the desired result, however I have to understand more about map function :-)</span>
