<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to generate a simple Python library using the following command:</p>
<p>```</p>
<blockquote>
<p>python setup.py bdist_dumb
  ```</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it will generate a tar.gz file with the contents specified in the setup.py script.</p>
<p>Once it is generated, I try to install ot using pip install command, but I am getting an error referrinf to the missing file setup.py.</p>
<p>I have specified to include such file in a MANIFEST.in file. But when I attempt to build the file, it is not included in my package.</p>
<p>As a reference I am checking pyspark package, but I can't find the place where the setup.py file is specified to be included.</p>
<p>Can anyone give me a hint for including this file in order to install the tar.gz library?</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>

<p>You're asking a wrong question for a wrong problem. You don't need to include <code>setup.py</code> because you don't need to build <code>bdist_dumb</code>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/builtdist.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dumb distributions</a> cannot be installed with <code>pip</code>.</p>
<p>If you want a pip-installable distribution build a source distribution, an egg or a wheel:</p>
<pre><code>python setup.py sdist
python setup.py bdist_egg

pip install wheel
python setup.py bdist_wheel
</code></pre>
