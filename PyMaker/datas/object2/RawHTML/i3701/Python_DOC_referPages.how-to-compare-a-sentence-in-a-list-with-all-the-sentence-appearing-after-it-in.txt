<p>I am having a list which has 1200 sentences. I want to compute the Jaccard coefficient of a sentence in a list with all the other sentences after it. 
Like sent1 will be compared with sent2,3,... Then sent2 with sent3,4,...
I already have a function that takes 2 sets and returns the Jaccard coefficient. I just want to know how to write the python loops for the above scenario.</p>
<pre><code>list_question=[] #This List is later filled with sentences from a file

def jaccard(a,b): # computes Jaccard
    c=a.intersection(b)
    return float(len(c))/(len(a)+len(b)-len(c))

# ....Here i want to write the loop to compute the jaccard of sentences as explained in the question
</code></pre>
<p>I want to form a cluster of sentences which are similar based on the Jaccard Coeff score &gt; 0.5</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itertools.combination</a> like this: </p>
<pre><code>import itertools

def do_some_stuff(first, second):
    print('comapring', first, 'to', second)

sentences_list = ['fisrt', 'second', 'third', 'forth']
combinations = itertools.combinations(sentences_list, 2)
for first, second in combinations:
    do_some_stuff(first, second)
</code></pre>
<p>The snippet above would give you this output:</p>
<pre><code>comapring fisrt to second
comapring fisrt to third
comapring fisrt to forth
comapring second to third
comapring second to forth
comapring third to forth
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">share your code with us, no one will start from scratch for you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use 2 loops with the inner one being initialized by the present position of the 1st one. Something like <code>for i ...</code>, <code>for j in range(i,...</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The first step to writing a program is to understand the problem you are trying to solve and describe a solution. I find that it often helps to turn off my computer and get a pen and paper. Then I write <b>in words</b> the steps I need to follow to solve the problem. Only after I have a clear solution do I get back on my computer and start translating it into code.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">It would be helpful to know the desired output and what you want to do with those Jaccard coefficients.</span>
