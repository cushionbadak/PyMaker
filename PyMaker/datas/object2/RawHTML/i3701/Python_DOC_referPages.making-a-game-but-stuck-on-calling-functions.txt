<p>I am making a text based game where a player moves around from room to room. Each room is a Class with 4 positions in each room. I am using a Function for each position and Functions to take an input on where in the room to go. The problem is I want to Call a position Function then have that Function call an input Function again but because my Functions are all defined above the input Functions it doesn't work</p>
<p>Here is the code from the Class. The input Functions are at the bottom.</p>

<p>Representing rooms as functions is unlikely to be a viable approach. As you've discovered, you end up repeating a lot of code.</p>
<p>This sort of application is a classic use case for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python objects and classes</a>. (It looks as though you may still be learning Python, so you may not have encountered these yet.) Modelling rooms, minions, and items each as a class will allow you to express your game in a much simpler and more straightforward way.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Well yes I've only been learning Python for about a month. I'm representing the rooms as Classes not sure if that's what you meant.  Also you didn't solve the problem. I'm not re-writing everything from scratch because I'm 80% of the way done.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@C_Isn't_Sharp Wellâ€¦ you didn't actually ask a question up front, so I assumed what you were trying to ask was "what am I doing wrong here". I do see that these functions are wrapped in a class, but that doesn't mean that you're using classes in an effective, useful way -- and that will need to change.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok but how do I go about addressing the problem of calling a Function if it is defined below the Function I'm calling it from and cannot be defined above it. I posted the question looking for a solution to the specific problem. I structured the code in a way that makes sense to me based on my goals for the game, you may tackle it differently but the most effective way for me is dividing my code up into a Class for each room. Thanks anyway</span>
