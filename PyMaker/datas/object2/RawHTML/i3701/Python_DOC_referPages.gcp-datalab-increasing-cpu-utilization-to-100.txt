<p>I'm using <code>n1-highcpu-8</code> machine and running single notebook.
the CPU utilization is always below ~20%.
is it possible to use multi CPUs for utilization increasing?</p>

<p>There's nothing that automatically makes your notebook use multiple CPU cores; The notebook kernel will only ever use a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/datalab/docs/how-to/machine-type#considerations_when_choosing_a_vm_machine_type" rel="nofollow noreferrer">single CPU core</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to use multiple cores, then you have to either make your code explicitly run in parallel (e.g. take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">multiprocessing library</a> ), or use a framework which does that for you.</p>
