<p>My directory structure is as follow</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dir_1 -----under that ---&gt; I am having two folders names <code>libraries</code> and <code>scripts</code>  and a <code>__init__.py</code> file which is empty</p></li>
<li><p>Libraries folder is having many python files and having <code>__init__.py</code> file</p></li>
<li><p>I have added a print statement in <code>__init__.py</code> file. like print "*******************"</p></li>
<li><p>I have added a created a new file say test.py under libraries folder and having below code in that</p>
<p>class TEST:
    print "From class test"
obj = TEST()</p></li>
</ul>
<p><code>not getting proper indentation</code></p>

<p>Messing with <code>__init__.py</code>... It is best kept empty, unless you understand and want/need to use a package.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is your file named <code>init.py</code> or <code>__init__.py</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes it is <b>init</b>.py. typo</span>
<span class="comment-copy">stackoverflow changes __ to bold</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need something which should be called everytime when i call the script</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is the reason I thought of putting this in <code>__init__</code>.py file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you be more specific? What is <code>this</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am working on logging module and creating some default handlers. I want that piece of code to execute when user run his script. That is the reason I have added in init.py file thinking that i executes everytime when python script is triggererd</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Even I  checked pymodbus library and they did the same in init.py</span>
