<span class="comment-copy">You are opening XML document, that document by itself has no <code>title</code>, or any other tag, so how you see it (as well as all HTML elements) depends on the <b>viewer</b> browser uses to display such document. So what you are doing is quite meaningless. What are you trying to achieve? Test browser's XML viewer? or do something with that XML (e.g. test it or parse it)? or something else?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">nope in the xml there are &lt;Title&gt; tags and I want to extract them all is that not possible</span>
<span class="comment-copy">lol, do you understand the difference between xml and html?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For one thing Selenium does not parse XML for you, it interacts with HTML</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so how do I do please let me know..  how I can extract titles descriptions and links</span>
