<p>I have a following lines of code in python. I have to copy from table and pass it to the given file location. I do have a file named distance.txt but it errors file not found as file is already available in that location. </p>
<p>Can anybody tell what mistake I did.</p>
<pre><code>cur.execute(("""COPY (select source, target, sum(cost)/1000 as cost from dm where source != 88888888 and target != 88888888 group by source, target order by source) TO '%s\\distance.txt'""") % (os.getcwd()))
con.commit()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try:</p>
<pre><code>import os
filepath = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'distance.txt')

cur.execute("""COPY (select source, target, sum(cost)/1000 as cost from dm where source != 88888888 and target != 88888888 group by source, target order by source) TO '%s'""" % (filepath))

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DB-API 2.0 interface for SQLite databases</a> documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># Never do this -- insecure!
symbol = 'RHAT'
c.execute("SELECT * FROM stocks WHERE symbol = '%s'" % symbol)

# Do this instead
t = ('RHAT',)
c.execute('SELECT * FROM stocks WHERE symbol=?', t)
print(c.fetchone())
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Applying that rule to your problem, leads us here:</p>
<pre><code>import os
filepath = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'distance.txt')

cur.execute("COPY (Select * FROM SomeTable) TO ?", (filepath, ))
con.commit()
</code></pre>
