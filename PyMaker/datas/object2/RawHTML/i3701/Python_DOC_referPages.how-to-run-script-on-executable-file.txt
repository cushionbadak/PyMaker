<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NbAlV.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="screenshot of console window" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NbAlV.png"/></a></p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>C:\Users\guyzw&gt;solveme.exe
Hello fellow, can you solve this math problem?

2 x 7?

&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I'm run this exe file on my linux machine using wine, I want to write some of script in bash or python to insert the answer automatically, my question is how can I do so? this exe file doesn't get args so I don't now where to begin...</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess</a> module to run external programs from within a Python script.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; output = subprocess.Popen("solveme.exe", stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
&gt;&gt;&gt; output.communicate()[0]
'hello fellow, can you solve this math problem?\n\n2 x 7?\n'

<p>Checkout xdotool: <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool</a></p>
<p>It allows you to create fake keyboard and mouse input in linux.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think that in this case you need to call <code>wine</code> with <code>args=[/path/to/solveme.exe]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh, I concur! Thanks for the heads up. Here's a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/47868895/9920493">post</a> elaborating on R2RT's comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ kimplausibl0 - if I doing so, I got some empty lines without 'hello fellow, can you solve this math problem?\n\n2 x 7?\n' ... what I miss?</span>
