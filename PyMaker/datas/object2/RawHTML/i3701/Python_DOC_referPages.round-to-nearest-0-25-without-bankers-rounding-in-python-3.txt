<p>I would like to round a series of number like this:</p>
<pre><code>0 -&gt; 0
0.1 -&gt; 0
0.125 -&gt; 0.25
0.25 -&gt; 0.25
</code></pre>
<p>I have heard that I can use round(x*4)/4 to find the nearest 0.25 unit. However, there will be some problems at the boundary with this function</p>
<pre><code>0.125 -&gt; 0 (with round(x*4)/4)
</code></pre>
<p>Is there anyway I can do the above rounding correctly? Thanks</p>

<p>The <code>decimal</code> module gives more control over rounding behavior. Particularly, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.ROUND_HALF_UP" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ROUND_HALF_UP</code></a> rounding mode rounds to the nearest option when there is a nearest option and rounds away from zero when there's a tie, matching what you want:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from decimal import Decimal, ROUND_HALF_UP
&gt;&gt;&gt; def round_your_way(d):
...     return (d*4).quantize(Decimal('1'), rounding=ROUND_HALF_UP)/4
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; round_your_way(Decimal('0.125'))
Decimal('0.25')
&gt;&gt;&gt; round_your_way(Decimal('0.1'))
Decimal('0')
&gt;&gt;&gt; round_your_way(Decimal('0.25'))
Decimal('0.25')
</code></pre>

<p>Simply multiply by 4, round, then divide by 4.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@coldspeed: Those questions don't handle the rounding mode behavior the questioner is looking for (which appears to be ROUND_HALF_UP).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112 The question is not framed well, so I do not really want to reopen it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@coldspeed: Looks like it's clearer now, with the new edit.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@coldspeed: I was not aware this was a duplicate.  Not everyone can be expected to search for every question every time.  I do flag loads of dupes, but can't be expected to see 100% of them.  It's good that you saw it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Biting the bullet, this one is on me and not a dupe in fact. Then again, advice still stands... kinda? Anyway, you may need to modify this answer to address OP's question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does not work for 0.125 -&gt; 0.25.</span>
