<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I work with large csv files and wanted to test if we can sum a numeric
 column using Python. I generated a random data set:</p>
<pre><code>id,first_name,last_name,email,gender,money
1,Clifford,Casterou,ccasterou0@dropbox.com,Male,53
2,Ethyl,Millichap,emillichap1@miitbeian.gov.cn,Female,58
3,Jessy,Stert,jstert2@gnu.org,Female,    
4,Doy,Beviss,dbeviss3@dedecms.com,Male,80
5,Josee,Rust,jrust4@epa.gov,Female,13
6,Hedvige,Ahlf,hahlf5@vkontakte.ru,Female,67
</code></pre>
<p>On line 3 you will notice that value is missing(i removed that data on
 purpose   to test.)</p>
<p>I wrote the code :</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open("mock_7.txt","r+",encoding='utf8') as fin:
    headerline = fin.readline()

    amount = 0
    debit = 0
    value = 0
    for row in csv.reader(fin):
    #     var = row.rstrip()
        value =row[5].replace('',0)
        value= float(value)
        debit+=value
    print (debit)
</code></pre>
<p>I got the error :</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "sum_csv1_v2.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    value+= float(value)
TypeError: must be str, not float
</code></pre>
<p>As i am new to Python, my plan was to convert the empty cells with zero but I think i am missing something here. Also my script is based on comma separated files but i'm sure it wont work for other delimited files.  Can you help me improve this code?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The original exception, now lost in the edit history,</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: replace() argument 2 must be str, not int
</code></pre>
<p>is the result of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.replace()</code></a> expecting string arguments, but you're passing an integer zero. Instead of replace you could simply check for empty string before conversion:</p>
<pre><code>value = row[5]
value = float(value) if value else 0.0
</code></pre>
<p>Another option is to catch the potential <code>ValueError</code>:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    value = float(row[5])

except ValueError:
    value = 0.0
</code></pre>
<p>This might hide the fact that the column contains "invalid" values other than just missing values.</p>
<p>Note that had you passed string arguments the end result would probably not have been what you expected:</p>
<pre><code>In [2]: '123'.replace('', '0')
Out[2]: '0102030'

In [3]: float(_)
Out[3]: 102030.0
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see an empty string as the "needle" ends up replacing around each and every character in the string.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The latest exception in the question, after fixing the other errors, is the result of the <code>float(value)</code> conversion working and</p>
<pre><code>value += float(value)
</code></pre>
<p>being equal to:</p>
<pre><code>value = value + float(value)
</code></pre>
<p>and as the exception states, strings and floats don't mix.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Problem with your code is you're calling <code>replace()</code> without checking if its <code>row[5]</code> is empty or not.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed code:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import csv

<span class="comment-copy">Opps sorry my bad. I have updated the question description. I was working with other files so i forgot to edit the script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could have a look at pandas. It can solve your problem in one line or two.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Worked like a charm thanks :).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, another problem has occurred is that my script is working for comma separated files but its not working for '|' delimited files. Any solution to that ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Pass <code>delimiter='|'</code> to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv.reader()</code></a>. And please refrain from adding up to the question. A question should be a bout a specific programming problem: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic">stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic</a>. If you have new questions, ask them as such.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I ran the query on an actual data and i realized it was not the problem of the delimiter but the values are something like this '12.4       ' . Can this blank be removed using strip? and where do i place the strip command ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I did have a double sum them. I have removed the extra add in value.</span>
