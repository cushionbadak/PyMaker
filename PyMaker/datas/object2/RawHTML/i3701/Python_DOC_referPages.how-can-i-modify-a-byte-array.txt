<p>I was reading about bytes and byte array's. I read that byte arrays mutable types!
so, when i am trying to modify it i am getting an error saying <code>integer is required</code> Am i missing something here? The following is my code and the error</p>
<pre><code>z=bytearray("hello world","utf-8")
z[0] ="H"
</code></pre>
<p>i got the following error</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call
  last)  in ()
  ----&gt; 1 z[0]="H"</p>
<p>TypeError: an integer is required</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As the docs say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bytearray type is a mutable sequence of <strong>integers</strong> in the range 0 &lt;= x &lt; 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason you can create it with a string as each character is converted to its ASCII <strong>integer</strong> value. So when assigning <code>'H'</code> you actually mean to assign <code>72</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to assign chars, then just pass each one into <code>ord()</code> first.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you mean <code>z[0] = ord('H')</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh!, so, i have to give the ascii value? @Norrius</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so, how would i modify it to have UTF-8 characters?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kalyan ASCII is a subset of Unicode encodings, so it is already UTF-8.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kalyan Don't use a <code>bytearray</code>! Use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JoeIddon, i was just learning about bytearray's so, i was trying to use it. But, from what you mentioned, i cant modify the string to have a utf-8 character right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kalyan It is not a string that it is being modified. It is a <code>bytearray</code>. If you know from C or similar, an array is (normally) a sequence of <i>integers</i> that can be indexed. A <code>string</code> is normally seen in higher-level languages but at the fundamental level, it is an array of <i>integers</i> representing the ASCII characters (a UTF-8 subset). So if you want a string where you can change the characters by index, you would be better of with a <code>list</code> of individual characters e.g: <code>list("hello there")</code> which gives <code>['h', 'e', 'l', ...]</code> so then you can modify chars by index as lists are mutable.</span>
