<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am very new to python and have been struggling with this issue for quite some time now. I don't understand that why is my code producing this error message and abruptly stops in between:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:/...some path../Random_marks.py", line 70, in &lt;module&gt;
total_marks = int(total)
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'A\n'
</code></pre>
<p>From what I understand is that it is never going in the <code>if</code> statement in line number 66 (marked with a comment below) of my code. But I don't understand why and how to fix it? Variable total is of string type only, so <code>isalpha()</code> should return <code>True</code>. But when I print it, it says <code>False</code> for some reason.</p>
<p>Here is the enitre code, but problems are only in the while loop at the bottom I guess.</p>

<p>Problem occurs when it reads the character <code>'A'</code>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>isalpha</code></a> checks if every character of the string is alphabetic.

<span class="comment-copy">Quite surprising, python has no idea how to convert "A" to integer (this is what function int() is for).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it works!... Thank You.</span>
