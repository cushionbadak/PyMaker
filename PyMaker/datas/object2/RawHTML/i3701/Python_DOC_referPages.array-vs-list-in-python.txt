<p>I'm trying to understand the basic difference between array and list in python. I've written a sample code for Palindrome string check in python. I'm  trying to understand why it is not working. Here I'm comparing a string parameter with list parameter.</p>
<p>Can anyone explain me why the below code is giving wrong output?</p>
<pre><code>class Palindrome:

    @staticmethod
     def is_palindrome(word):
         i = 0
         l = len(word)
         rev = []
         print(l)
         while l &gt; 0:
             rev.insert(i, word[l - 1])
             i = i + 1
             l = l - 1

         if rev == word:
             print(test)
             print(word)
             return True
         else:
             print(rev)
             print(word)
             return False

print(Palindrome.is_palindrome('tatat'))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output for the above code is</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>$python main.py
5
['t', 'a', 't', 'a', 't']
tatat
False
</code></pre>
<p>One more thing is that, why it is printing the array value like <strong>['t', 'a', 't', 'a', 't']</strong> instead of <strong>tatat</strong>
I have tried the append() method as well but no use and the result is same.</p>

<p>You are inserting characters into a list, the end result of which is still a list and explicitly not a string; that is why your palindrome test returns <code>False</code> because what you compare is <code>['t', 'a', 't', 'a', 't'] == 'tatat'</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to do this correctly you need to declare <code>rev</code> as an empty string and append to it.</p>
<pre><code> rev = ''
 for i in range(len(word)):
     rev += word[len(word) - i]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You are comparing a <code>string</code> (your word input) with a <code>list</code> of characters. You will have to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.join()</code></a> your characters into a <code>string</code> before comparing it to your original <code>string</code>.</p>

<p>I don't know why people over react here. If anyone comes here for any help we should help him (if we can ) or at least don't discourage him. What's wrong in my question? If there is any wrong let me know in a smooth way instead of attacking altogether. We are here to learn something and grow together.
Anyhow, here is the solution for the Question that I posted above:</p>
<pre><code>class Palindrome:

@staticmethod
def is_palindrome(word):
    i= 0
    l= len(word)
    rev = ""
    print(l)
    while(l&gt;0):
        rev += word[l - 1]
        l = l-1
        i =i+1
    if (rev == word):
        print(rev)
        print(word)
        return True
    else:
        print(rev)
        print(word)
        return False
print(Palindrome.is_palindrome('tatat'))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">There are no 'arrays' in python. You seem to be comparing a <code>list</code> and a <code>string</code> (<code>if rev == word:</code>). I think these will never compare equal.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>[]</code> is a list in python. Its printing <code>['t', 'a', 't', 'a', 't']</code> because you take each letter and put it in a list - <code>rev.insert(i,word[l-1])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's the output that you're looking for?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There isn't even an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html#array.array" rel="nofollow noreferrer">array</a> anywhere in your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well you "initilize" <code>rev</code> as a list so printing it out prints a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi @MarcelZoll, Thanks for the answer. It is working well with little bit modification to it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Either changing the list to a string or the string to a list before comparing would be sufficient.</span>
