<p>Scrapy documentation is recommending using Anaconda (or Miniconda) to install Scrapy on Windows (<a href="https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html#windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though it’s possible to install Scrapy on Windows using pip, we recommend you to install Anaconda or Miniconda and use the package from the conda-forge channel, which will avoid most installation issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anaconda is a Python software distribution with data science and machine learning in mind, whereas Miniconda is trimmed-down version of Anaconda with easy way to install additional packages. For your use case I recommend Miniconda. </p>
<p>If you don't want to use Miniconda, maybe let's focus on installing Twisted first. It has recommendations for installing on Windows (<a href="https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads#ThroughPip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are installing on Windows, pip install Twisted[windows_platform] will install the Windows-specific requirements. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe you could try installing Twisted first and then try to install Scrapy?</p>
