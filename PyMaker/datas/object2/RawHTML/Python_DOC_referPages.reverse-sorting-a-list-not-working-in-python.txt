<p>I'm using python 3.7 and something interesting is happening when sorting and I cannot understand why. Maybe someone can help?</p>
<pre><code>numlist = [4,8,2,6]
print(sorted(numlist))
print(sorted(numlist[::-1]))
print(sorted(numlist,reverse=True))
</code></pre>
<p>Output is this:</p>
<pre><code>[2, 4, 6, 8]
[2, 4, 6, 8]
[8, 6, 4, 2]
</code></pre>
<p>I have two questions.</p>
<p>1) Why is the first reverse not actually reversing?</p>
<p>2) Why is the second reverse, which is equivalent, actually working?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>With <code>sorted(numlist[::-1])</code>, the <code>[::-1]</code> slice simply reverses the list before you pass the reversed list to <code>sorted</code>, which sorts it in the default order. And with <code>sorted(numlist, reverse=True)</code>, you're actually telling <code>sorted</code> to sort in the reversed order since you pass to it the <code>reverse=True</code> argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's easy to understand.</p>
<pre><code>print(sorted(numlist)) =&gt; print(sorted([4,8,2,6]))
print(sorted(numlist[::-1])) =&gt; print(sorted([6,2,8,4]))
print(sorted(numlist, reverse=True)) =&gt; print(sorted([4,8,2,6], reverse=True)) =&gt; print(sorted([4,8,2,6])[::-1])
</code></pre>
<p>sort <code>[4,8,2,6]</code> has nothing different than sort <code>[6,2,8,4]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>print(sorted(numlist[::-1]))</code> is only reversing your <em>input</em> list before it's passed to <code>sorted</code>. So, the input to <code>sorted</code> is <code>[6,2,8,4]</code> instead of <code>[4,8,2,6]</code>. <code>sorted</code> does not care what the input is; to sort in a descending order, <code>reverse</code> arg <em>must</em> be passed</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It should be <code>print(sorted(numlist)[::-1])</code>, you have placed slicing wrong</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Reversing a thing and then sorting it into ascending order is completely different from sorting it into descending order.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What have you expected the output to be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I failed to understand how it was passing the argument, not obvious to me. Not trying to come off as a smart ass, just a misunderstanding of the computation on my part.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, this makes much more sense. Thank you for explaining that in detail. Really helped me understand!</span>
