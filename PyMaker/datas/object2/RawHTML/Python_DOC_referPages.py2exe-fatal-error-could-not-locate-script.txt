<p>When I generate a script in py2exe, it generates the exe but when I open the exe, I am presented with this error:</p>
<pre><code>Could not locate script resource: The specified 
resource type cannot be found in the image file.

FATAL ERROR: Could not locate script
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my setup.py:</p>
<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup
from setuptools import setup
import py2exe
import sys

sys.argv.append('py2exe')

setup(console=['program.py'])
</code></pre>
<p>And here is the what the command prompt pops out when I run the command to generate the exe (python setup.py py2exe):</p>
<pre><code>running build
running py2exe

<p>I am searching all over the place but can't find the answer.</p>
<p>Thanks, 
Peppa</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I honestly don't know if this is a problem of py2exe or something is wrong internally in my python installation or operating system. I welcome all advice and recommendations.</p>

<p>In your <code>setup.py</code> you have two lines of the format <code>from foo import setup</code> - this will result in a conflict. What happens if you strip this <code>setup.py</code> back to the minimal example provided in the <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/Tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Tutorial</a>?</p>
<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe

setup(console=['program.py'])
</code></pre>
<p>If that doesn't help, it suggests the problem may lie in your environment.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried the example you gave and it still gave me the "FATAL ERROR: Could not locate script" error. If you can, can you go a little bit deeper on what you mean on how the problem lies in the environment? Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">An environment problem could be that it genuinely can't find the modules / files that it needs (as suggested by the <code>6 missing Modules</code> statement in your <code>python setup.py py2exe</code> output). It looks like your <code>py2exe</code> command is failing due to this, and as such even if a <code>.exe</code> is being generated, I wouldn't expect it to run (and you may find that the <code>.exe</code> is not being generated and you're just running an old version).  Did the output of the <code>python setup.py py2exe</code> change with the change to <code>setup.py</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nope, it just shows the exact same message as i mentioned in my question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I honestly still don't know what the problem was but now all of a sudden is started working. I know this is not a technical answer/comment but, it's working so, yeah. Thanks for all the help! I really do appreciate it!</span>
