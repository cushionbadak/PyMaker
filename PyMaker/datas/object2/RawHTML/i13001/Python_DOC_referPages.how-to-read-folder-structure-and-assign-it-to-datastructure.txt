<p>I'm only starting with python, and I'm trying to accomplish following:</p>
<p>I have a folder structure (simplified):</p>
<pre><code>-folder1
---file1
---file2
-folder2
---file3
-folder2
---file4
---file5
---file6
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like to read filenames into some kind of a datastructure, that is able to distinguish which files are from the same folder. I've used glob in a one folder case, but is it possible to get for example following datastructure using glob?</p>
<pre><code>files = [{file1, folder1}, {file2, folder1}, {file3, folder2}...]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I assume you'd rather get this kind of structure:</p>
<pre><code>files = {folder1: [file1, file2], folder2: [file3], ...}
</code></pre>
<p>The following code will do the trick:</p>
<pre><code>import os

rootDir = '.'
files = {}
for dirName, subdirList, fileList in os.walk(rootDir):
    files[dirName] = fileList
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I think that will work. What I need to do with the files is, that I list all combinations of 2 files, and for each pair I need to know if they're from the same folder.</span>
