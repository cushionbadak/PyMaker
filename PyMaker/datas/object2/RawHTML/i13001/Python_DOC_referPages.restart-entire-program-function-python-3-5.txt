<p>How do I make a function which can restart my entire program, without using a while loop......</p>
<p>I have tried and tried again (many times) and have not been able to make it work with a GUI (tkinter)</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/os.html#os.execl" rel="nofollow">execl</a>, which replaces the current process with a new process. You can give it the exact same arguments as the current process, effectively restarting your program:</p>
<pre><code>import sys, os
python = sys.executable
os.execl(python, python, * sys.argv)
</code></pre>
<p>Pay close attention to the documentation: this function does not return, and it doesn't close any connections or open files. Make sure you prepare your app for an immediate exit before calling.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use os.execl for this purpose.
There's a snippet over <a href="https://www.daniweb.com/programming/software-development/code/260268/restart-your-python-program-" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>You can find more information about those functions in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.execl" rel="nofollow">documentation</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">What you are asking is not clear at all please provide an example of your code with something you tried</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Restarting the entire process host seems unnecessary.  Instead, focus on managing the state of your application and simply set that to a known initial state in code.  Since we know <i>nothing</i> of your application, we can't really tell you how to do that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you <i>really</i> need to completely restart the application, or do you just need to reset the internal state? Restarting is possible (and fairly easy) but it seems rather drastic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This won't work on Windows if Python is installed in a path with spaces.</span>
