<p>I have been trying to make a python script that will play on Mac OS X and I have gotten it to work with a .py script in Terminal, but I can't stop it. 
I have been trying for weeks, <code>os.kill()</code>, <code>process.terminate()</code>, everything I could find on other StackOverflow questions. Here is my code, can anyone tell me the proper way to terminate this sub-process? (I believe I am using python 2.7)</p>
<pre><code>import time
import subprocess

subprocess.call(["afplay", "/Users/0095226/Desktop/introsong.wav"])
time.sleep(4)
(WHATEVER KILLS IT HERE PLEASE)
</code></pre>

<p>You need to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen" rel="nofollow">subprocess.Popen()</a> as you can assign the process handle to a variable and later kill it.</p>
<pre><code>import time
import subprocess

p = subprocess.Popen(["calc"])
time.sleep(4)
p.kill()
</code></pre>
<p>The other method is to use <code>os.kill()</code> along with <code>signal.SIGINT</code> to kill the process, as seen here:</p>
<pre><code>import time
import signal
import subprocess
import os

p = subprocess.Popen(["calc"])
time.sleep(4)
os.kill(p.pid, signal.SIGINT)
</code></pre>
<p>We are able to access the PID (Process ID) and therefore we can kill it using <code>os.kill()</code>. <code>signal</code> is the module which contains codes for how to kill the process, e.g. send it the abort (SIGABRT), interrupt (SIGINT) etc.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! The first solution you gave me worked thank you, sorry for not responding promptly I could not test this until now.</span>
