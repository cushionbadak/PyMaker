<p>When I use some frameworks and create methods in class, pass them arguments which has default values.</p>
<p>And values are inknown for me. I don't know how to create methods like this?</p>
<p>I know how default argument works, but for example:</p>
<pre><code>def paint(self, e):
    print e # this is wx python and e is class object which i haven't passed.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To set a default values for a method you do this:</p>
<pre><code>def myFunction(parameter1, defaultParameter = None):
    #your code
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think your confusion is how it is defined, but how it is called. It looks like a method that is typically called by other parts of the framework, rather than by you. The framework is responsible for passing the correct argument in that case.</span>
