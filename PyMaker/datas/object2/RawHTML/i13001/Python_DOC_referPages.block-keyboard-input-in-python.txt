<p>In Python, is there a way to prevent the user from entering anything via keyboard, so that terminal output does not get cluttered by unneeded input?</p>
<p>In my case, the user is supposed to press and hold a key to register a specific keyboard - so, the actual input (as in <code>input()</code>) is not needed, but only clutters the output and menu.</p>
