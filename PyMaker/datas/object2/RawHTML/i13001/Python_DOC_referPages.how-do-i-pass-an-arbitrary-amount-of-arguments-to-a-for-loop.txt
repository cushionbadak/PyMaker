<p>I want to pass items from a dictionary to a for loop, in such a way, that I can pass an arbitrary amount of called dictionary items to it.</p>
<p>I've tried searching for it all day yesterday, yet I could not find an answer that I understood.</p>
<p>Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code>import itertools

categories = {
    "cat1": ["House Cat", "Lion"],
    "cat2": ["House", "Apartment", "Cellar"],
    "cat3": ["Germany", "England", "USA", "Brazil"]
}

def find_unique_combinations(*args):
    args = args
    for combination in itertools.product(args):
        print(combination)

find_unique_combinations(categories["cat1"], categories["cat2"])
</code></pre>
<p>I'm also being given this error:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: Required argument 'r' (pos 2) not found
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You cannot pass an arbitrary number of arguments to combinations() because it is written to take an iterable. The r argument is to denote what length of combination you want from your iterable. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you read <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a>?  What do you intend <code>itertools.combinations(args)</code> to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You searched for it all day and, with an error message like that, didn't look at the documentation to see what kind of arguments it takes?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you using <code>itertools.combinations</code> here? Also, what do you want to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BrenBarn I meant to use itertools.product(...), sorry.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm also puzzled by <code>args = args</code>.</span>
