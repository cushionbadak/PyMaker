<p>The Python code below lets me read the file size.</p>
<pre><code>import os
b = os.path.getsize("known_drive_name/folder_name_partial_known/file_name_partial_unknown_file_ext_known")
print b
</code></pre>
<p>But given the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I know the drive name;</li>
<li>There is only one file inside the folder;</li>
<li>I know the file extension;</li>
<li>I don't know the file name (or I know only certain letters);</li>
<li>I don't know the folder name (or I know only certain letters);</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you help me build the code to find the size of the file?</p>

<p>As stated by tmoreau, you can use the glob module
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.glob</a></p>
<p>If you only want to match one file you can try :</p>
<pre><code>import glob
import os
extension = ".gif"
drive = "/mnt/ssd0/"
dir_glob = "**/[0-9]/*"
paths = glob.glob(drive + dir_glob + extension)
if paths: # if the list is not empty
    print os.path.getsize(paths[0])
</code></pre>
<p>of course you will have to adapt the glob_pattern according to what you know of the directory names.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks kevin for the edit. new here!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks  tmoreau.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks paul.  This works.  i am yet trying to get the regex correct!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you can share the information you have about the path I could probably help you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why do I get"IndexError: list index out of range' error some time?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is because the regex you use doesn't match any file, i'm editing the code so you don't get this error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you be more clear about your regex : what does the directory name contain, in what order, what is the drive name, do you want to search recursively in sub folders? what is the extension you want to match?</span>
