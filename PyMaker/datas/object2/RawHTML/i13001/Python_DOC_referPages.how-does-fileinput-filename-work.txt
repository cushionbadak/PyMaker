<p>I am making a script which takes a file from terminal as an input. In order to do that I call <code>myScript</code> like that:</p>
<pre><code>$python myScript.py &lt;fileInput.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The script is also pretty simple:</p>
<pre><code>import fileinput
for line in fileinput.input():
    if 'BLABLABLA' in line:
    print(line, 'THAT IS THE LINE CONTAINING BLABLABLA from the file %s' %fileinput.filename())
</code></pre>
<p>But the output is:</p>
<pre><code>Tweedledum said BLABLABLA! THAT IS THE LINE CONTAINING BLABLABLA from the &lt;stdin&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>What am I doing wrong? How does the <code>fileinput.filename()</code> works? Why does it output <code>&lt;stdin&gt;</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>fileinput.input()</code> <em>iterates over the lines of all files listed in sys.argv[1:], defaulting to sys.stdin if the list is empty</em> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html" rel="nofollow">source</a>).</p>
<p><code>&lt;fileInput.txt</code> sends the contents of <code>fileInput.txt</code> to stdin. The filename won't appear in <code>sys.argv</code>, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_(computing)" rel="nofollow">input redirection</a> is handled by your shell.</p>
<p>If the filename contains the <code>&lt;</code> character (or any other "special" characters), you'd quote it:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint-override"><code>$ python myScript.py '&lt;fileInput.txt'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, so is it so that it's impossible to get the filename? Or is there any trick? I've found this line: <i>italic</i> To specify an alternative list of filenames, pass it as the first argument to input(). A single file name is also allowed. I need to think a bit)))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Anna-Lischen: I updated the answer, take a look.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you so much! I got it. So the mistake was simple))): <code>&lt;</code> it's not a file symbol. I actually thought that I needed this symbol to put the file inside the script. After such a mod, everything works perfectly and I get the required file name =)</span>
