<p>I really need some help with this code. I have to write code using the input file <code>Unit 5 Dates.txt</code>, containing dates in the form <code>yyyy/mm/dd</code>, read all lines into a list, find the earliest and the latest dates and print, then transform the date string into the form <code>July 12, 2014</code> and print all dates. </p>
<p>I have written the code and it's working fine, but I don't know how to transform the date into the form <code>November 10, 2015</code>.</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    dateList = get_list()
    dateMin = find_min(dateList)
    print(dateMin)
    dateMax = find_max(dateList)
    print(dateMax)
    print ()
    print_dates(dateList)
    #changeDate = date_changer(dateList) 

def get_list():
    infile = open("Unit 5 Dates.txt", 'r')
    dateList = infile.readlines()
    infile.close()
    return dateList

def find_min(dateList):
    dateMin = dateList[0]
    for index in range(len(dateList)):
        dateList[index] = dateList[index].rstrip("\n")
        if dateList[index] &lt; dateMin:
            dateMin = dateList[index]

    return "The earlest date in the file is: " + dateMin

def find_max(dateList):
    dateMax = dateList[0]
    for index in range(len(dateList)):
        if dateList[index] &gt; dateMax:
            dateMax = dateList[index]

    return"The latest date in the file is: " + dateMax


def print_dates(dateList):
    print("This is the list of dates")
    for index in range(len(dateList)):
        print(dateList[index])

main()
</code></pre>
<p>What your told me, I have do that, but it not working. What if i want to read it from a txt file name <code>Unit 5 Dates.txt</code>, that already have all the dates in it. For example, if you look at my code, I create a value returning function called <code>get_list</code>, and then I <code>define</code> it and open the <code>Unit 5 dates.txt</code>, file and read all the dates from the txt file.</p>
<p>Here Iis what I have so far. I have have create a create a function called <code>date_chnage</code> and also I have define the function. But when I run the code it give me a error message.. </p>
<pre><code>def date_changer(dateList):

import datetime as datechanger

infile = open("Unit 5 Dates.txt", 'r')   

print("This is the list of dates")
for index in range(len(dateList)):
    dateList = datechanger.datetime.strptime(datechanger, '%Y/%m/%d').date()
    print (date.strftime("%B %d, %Y")) 

main()
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the error it's giving me</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow">datetime</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime as dt

dates='''\
2015/11/11
1941/12/07
1776/07/04'''

for ds in dates.splitlines():
    date=dt.datetime.strptime(ds, '%Y/%m/%d').date()
    print(date.strftime("%B %d, %Y"))
</code></pre>
<p>Prints:</p>
<pre><code>November 11, 2015
December 07, 1941
July 04, 1776
</code></pre>
<p>You can use a datetime date for max and min as well:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; max(dates.splitlines(), key=lambda l: dt.datetime.strptime(l, '%Y/%m/%d').date())
'2015/11/11'
&gt;&gt;&gt; min(dates.splitlines(), key=lambda l: dt.datetime.strptime(l, '%Y/%m/%d').date())
'1776/07/04'
</code></pre>
<p>While I am using <code>dates.splitlines()</code> in the example, that could be another source -- such as a file. </p>
<p>In the case where you have YYYY/MM/DD as digits in a string, you can also just use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" rel="nofollow">lexicographical sorting</a> to determine min/max as well:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; max(dates.splitlines())
'2015/11/11'
&gt;&gt;&gt; min(dates.splitlines())
'1776/07/04'
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to convert or validate a date, use datetime.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should look into <code>datetime</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could also, of course, simply use a list of month names and a lookup, but there are date library functions that will do it too, as @jon says.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">The first argument in <code>datetime.strptime</code> needs to be a string, such as <code>"2015/11/11"</code> You are using a module. Write a loop that will read the dates  from a file and then use each string in turn.</span>
