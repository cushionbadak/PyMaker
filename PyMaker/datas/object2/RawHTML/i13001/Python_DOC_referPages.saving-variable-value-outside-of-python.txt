<p>I am new to python, been coding in school for about a year now, but I like to code when I get bored. I have made two programs but both are useless as I have to input each value of the variables every time I start it up. Is there anyway I can save the value of a variable externally so when it loads it will open up the file and assign each variable?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should use the <code>pickle</code> module for that purpose:</p>
<pre><code>l =[1,2,3,4,5]
import pickle
pickle.dump(l,open("mydata","wb"))
</code></pre>
<p>and for getting your variable back:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle
l = pickle.load(open("mydata","rb"))
</code></pre>
<p>If you have many variables to save, consider embedding them in a dictionary for instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yo can use the <code>shelve</code> module its pretty simple it puts all variables into a dictionary then when your file reopens you can make shelve set the variables back. Here is a good <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/110586/rockpaperscissorsv2-follow-up-advanced">example</a> of using the shelve module.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To save data to a file, you could use </p>
<pre><code>filehandle = open(filename, 'w')
filehandle.write(string)
filehandle.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Preferred in Python is</p>
<pre><code>with open(filename, 'w') as filehandle:
   filehandle.write(string)
</code></pre>
<p>because the file will be closed upon exiting the <code>with</code> block even if the block exits with an error, and without requiring the programmer to remember to close the file.</p>
<p>Load the values back in with <code>filehandle.readline()</code> or <code>readlines()</code>.</p>
<p>You can also use the Python libraries <code>json</code> or <code>csv</code> to facilitate moving data into and out of files. If you have no need to inspect or modify the data in the file using another program (e.g. Notepad++ or MS Excel), you might prefer <code>pickle</code> or <code>shelve</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Sure - save it as a settings file and load the settings on startup. See the configparser module, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">... with the proviso that pickle is proprietary, ie not really readable by anything other than Python, where configparser or json or yaml may be a bit easier for an end user to modify.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good concept, easily read, a more experienced type concept +1</span>
