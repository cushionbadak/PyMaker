<p>Is there a difference, in the way python does the comparing, between:</p>
<pre><code>if x == 0.0:
    print "x is zero"
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>if not x:
    print "x is zero"
</code></pre>
<p>that would make one preferred to the other?</p>

<p>Just complementing the comments above, here is the bytecode:</p>
<pre><code>In [10]: dis.dis(is_zero_equal_sign)
2         0 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)
          3 LOAD_CONST               1 (0)
          6 COMPARE_OP               2 (==)
          9 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       20

3        12 LOAD_CONST               2 ('zero')
         15 PRINT_ITEM

         17 JUMP_FORWARD             0 (to 20)
    &gt;&gt;   20 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
         23 RETURN_VALUE

         17 RETURN_VALUE        
</code></pre>
<p>Looking at the bytecode it seems like the difference is basically insignificant in terms of performance. When using the equal sign CPython still has to load 0 as a constant and the comparison process is slightly different. If you simply want the one with less steps, you can use the one without '=='.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>x = False</code> <code>if not x. . .</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If the value will only ever be numeric, then the main difference is readability. <code>if x == 0.0</code> makes it clear to a reader that the value is numeric even if they see only that one line; <code>if not x</code> does not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if there is any chance that <code>x</code> will not be a float/int, ie if <code>x == Null or x == '' or x == []</code> etc. other than that, as @CharlesDuffy said, its just readability</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RNar I think you mean <code>None</code>, not <code>Null</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Galax yeeeeehhh, thats the one :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Cool, I didn't know bytecode existed, but I guess that is what I wanted to know, which one takes less steps.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, you can always check the generated bytecode of a function using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">'dis' module</a>. ;)</span>
