<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have defined this class:</p>
<pre><code>class User():
 def __init__(self, ip, update, priority):
    self.ip = ip
    self.update = update
    self.priority = priority
</code></pre>
<p>I work with a Socket and every time one client is connect I create an User object. I would like to save it somewhere and then be able to process its data, meaning read the file where it's saved.
I don't know how to do that. I tried using a txt file but with the fields of the class User is to complicated and I would also like to have something more dynamic, like</p>
<pre><code>add(user), isPresent(user), overwrite(user)
</code></pre>
<p>What is the best solution for my case?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If your User class is really that simple, you can use Pickle:</p>

<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>(both Python 2 and 3 links included).</p>
<pre><code> u = User(127.0.0.1, "foo", "bar")
 pickle.dumps(u)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">either connect to a database or use pickle and put your info in a dictionary that you can save and read to update</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have any example using a database?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">not really - that is more complicated but there are example on-line, try google "python database"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. What does it happen if I save twice the same object? There will be only one or two entities?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@m.ridolfi - as far as I know, Pickle should be idempotent. So saving the same object multiple times will have the same result. Now, of course, you have to <i>pick</i> where to save the object (a text file, to a database, whatever), so if you're asking can you <i>physically</i> save the same object twice, that's entirely up to you.</span>
