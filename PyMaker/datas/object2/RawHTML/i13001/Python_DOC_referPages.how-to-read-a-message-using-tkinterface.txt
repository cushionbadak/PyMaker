<p>This is the "click me" function which runs when the button on the interface is clicked.</p>
<pre><code>def click_me():

<p>There is a grey line beneath <code>the_file_name</code> in brackets and when hovered over says: passing str instead of file - is this intentional?</p>

<p>The relevant TKInter code is as follows...</p>
<pre><code>file_name_entry = Entry(encrypt_frame, width=20)
file_name_entry.grid(column = 1, row = 1, sticky = W)
Button(encrypt_frame, text= "Submit", command = click_me).grid(column = 2, row = 1)

<p>Your code is close, but you're trying to read from the file name rather than the opened file object. Change your code to this:</p>
<pre><code>file=open(the_file_name, "r")
imp_message = file.read()
</code></pre>
<p>Better yet, use a context manager which will automatically close the file when you're done:</p>
<pre><code>with open(the_file_name, "r") as f:
    imp_message = f.read()
</code></pre>
<p>The python documentation has a nice tutorial on reading and writing files: </p>
<ul>
<li>Python 2 - <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow">Reading and writing files</a></li>
<li>Python 3 - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow">Reading and writing files</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Unrelated to the actual question, there are a couple problems with your code.</p>
<p>First, there's no need for this statement:</p>
<pre><code>the_file_name = str(file_name)
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>file_name</code> is already a string since it is coming from an <code>Entry</code> widget.</p>
<p>Second, the index <code>0.0</code> in the statement <code>password_output.delete(0.0, END)</code> is incorrect. Text widget indexes must be strings in the form of <em>&lt;line&gt;</em>.<em>&lt;column&gt;</em>, and lines start at 1 (one). The proper index for the first character is the string <code>"1.0"</code>. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">The first error sounds like something that your editor is suggesting.  Second, you are never assigning the open file to anything, so <code>file.read(...)</code> is not going to work since <code>file</code> (as far as we can see) has not been assigned.  Also, using <code>file</code> as a variable name is not a good idea.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why is "file." even necessary? the filename is already assigned by the_file_name so it is useful?</span>
