<p>I am trying to make a program that asks the user a file input with the prompt "New file name" and the program should work like this and if the name has any form and/or combinations of "importantdocument.text" and i try the new forms and how can i make the code work easier than keep putting <code>{variable} != {form of importantdocumant.txt}</code> can anyone help to see what i'm doing wrong or write a code that does what the program is supposed to do? thanks ahead of time.</p>
<p>my program</p>
<pre><code>a = input('New file name: ')
if a != 'ImportantDocument.txt' and a != 'importantDOCUMENT.txt' and a != 'IMPORTANTDOCUMENT.TXT' and a != 'importantdocument.txt' and a != '':
    print('That name is allowed.')
elif a == 'ImportantDocument.txt' or a == 'importantDOCUMENT.txt' or a == 'IMPORTANTDOCUMENT.TXT' or a == 'importantdocument.txt':
    print('That file already exists.')
</code></pre>
<p>what the programs supposed to output</p>
<pre><code>New file name: lessimportantdocument.txt
This name is allowed.
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>New file name: ImPorTaNtdoCumenT.tXt
That file already exists.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>    a = input('New file name: ')
    k = a.upper()
    if k != 'IMPORTANTDOCUMENT.TXT':
           print("That name is allowed")
    if k == 'IMPORTANTDOCUMENT.TXT':
           print("That file already exists")
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are wanting to check if the file exists, you could try read it. I've not tested this but it should work.</p>
<pre><code>file_location = 'C:/Folder/' + a

try:
    with open(file_location , "r") as f:
        f.read()
except IOError:
    print("That file already exists")
else:
    print("That name is allowed")
</code></pre>
<p>If you literally just wanting to neaten up the code you have currently, then Mohd's answer is good.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm not clear what you're asking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know much about python, but i there has to be a <code>toupper</code> or <code>tolower</code> equivalent, checking for all combinations of CaPitalIZATION is unrealistic and prone to errors (like you have not checked ImPORtAnTDocuMENT.TxT as an example)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please try to give a proper title like "Enter file name and check pattern" and be precise in you r writing as the lines before the code are very confuse.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please explain your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In Python 3.3+, you might use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.casefold" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.casefold</code></a> over <code>.upper()</code> or <code>.lower()</code> if you need to deal with Unicode issues like <code>'ß'</code> being lowercase and equivalent to <code>'ss'</code>, but not converted to <code>'ss'</code> on <code>.lower()</code> (though it goes the other way too; the dotless i <code>'ı'</code> is unchanged by both <code>.lower()</code> and <code>.casefold()</code>, but normalized to <code>'I'</code> by <code>.upper()</code>; non-ASCII is dumb).</span>
