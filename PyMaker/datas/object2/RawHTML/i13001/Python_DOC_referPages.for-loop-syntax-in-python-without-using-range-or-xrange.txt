<p>I do not know much about python so i apologize if my question is a very basic one.  </p>
<p>Let's say i have a list</p>
<pre><code>lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
</code></pre>
<p>Now what i want to know is that if there is any way to write the following piece of code in python without using <code>range()</code> or <code>xrange()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for i in lst:
    for j in lst after element i: '''This is the line i want the syntax for'''
        #Do Something
</code></pre>
<p>The second loop is to access elements after the element <code>i</code> i.e., if i = 3, <code>j</code> would have to loop through from 4 to 10, so the pairs of numbers if <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are printed would be (1,2)..(1,10), (2,3)...(2,10), (3,4)..(3,10) etc.</p>
<p>I have no idea what to search for or what query to type on any search engine.<br/>
Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>This is what list slicing is about, you can take part of your list from i'th element through</p>
<pre><code>lst[i:]
</code></pre>
<p>furthermore, in order to have both index and value you need <code>enumerate</code> operation, which changes the list into list of pairs <code>(index, value)</code></p>
<p>thus</p>
<pre><code>for ind, i in enumerate(lst):
    for j in lst[ind+1: ]: 
        #Do Something
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like you might want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="noreferrer">enumerate()</a>:</p>
<pre><code>for index, item in enumerate(lst):
    for j in lst[index+1:]:
        #Do Something
</code></pre>

Do you want to iterate with the indices <code>(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)</code> or <code>(0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also is there a particular reason you don't want to use <code>range</code>? Is it for the sake of challenge/curiosity or something else?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SuperBiasedMan It was just out of curiosity nothing more.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SuperBiasedMan No i want to iterate with (0,1)...(0,10), then (1,2)...(1,10), then (2,3)..(2,10), this sort of looping.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, apologies. The link may be helpful but it's not a duplicate then.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you list slicing is the answer i was looking for!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">lst[index+1] is not a list, it is an element, furthermore, enumerate does not work this way around</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Whoops missed a colon, should be alright now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, I get the order of index and item in <code>enumerate</code> wrong every time I try to use it. It's like trying to get a USB in on the first try...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@turbulencetoo does that also mean that sometimes you get the order right but it still doesn't work so you reflexively try the other way?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I learned something new from your answer. I really appreciate it!</span>
