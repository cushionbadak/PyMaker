<p>This is getting really frustrating. Whenever I try to install Numpy on the prompt, Python will be downgraded to 2.7 and I can't do anything about it. </p>
<p>Here's the ss:

<p>I need a Python 3.5, Numpy 1.10 and scikit-learn 0.17 but I don't know how. Anyone knows how to do it? </p>

<p>Those versions are on the old side.
I imagine you are trying to get as close as possible to the environment used by the author of some tutorial that was written a while ago.
A fresh install might give you 1.16 and 0.20.</p>
<p>The conda solver was having trouble finding a compatible set of package versions using your python 3.5, which apparently led it to rewind back in time to a fairly early set of versions.
I recommend relaxing the constraint, from "equal" to "greater-or-equal":</p>
<pre><code>conda install numpy&gt;=1.10
</code></pre>
<p>If you get a somewhat more recent version, the tutorial likely will still work fine.</p>
<p>If you want to use multiple constraints, you may find it convenient to put them in an <code>environment.yml</code> file, and use <code>conda env update</code>:</p>
<pre><code>name: tutorial
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python &gt;= 3.5
  - numpy &gt;= 1.10
  - scikit-learn &gt;= 0.17
</code></pre>
<p>Remember to use <code>conda activate tutorial</code> so your <code>PATH</code> will use that environment.
For example, <code>$ which python</code> will show the newly installed interpreter, and <code>$ python -c 'import pprint, sys; pprint.pprint(sys.path)'</code> will mention a directory containing the new numpy library plus a bunch of transitive deps.</p>
