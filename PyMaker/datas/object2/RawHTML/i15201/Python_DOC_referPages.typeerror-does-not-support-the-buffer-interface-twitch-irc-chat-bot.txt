<p>To start off, I couldn't find an answer anywhere. Im not sure if its something I need to import or if its just poorly done code. In a nut shell, with this project im going to make a better twitch follower notifier with SMS messages, and a lot of other things.</p>
<p>Edit: The whole crash log is as follows: </p>
<pre><code>line 16 in &lt;module&gt;
irc.send('PASS ' + password + '\r\n')
TypeError: Does not support the buffer interface
</code></pre>
<p>Also, I had to repeatedly double click the file to get this, so I'm sorry if its a little bit off. I couldn't get a coded crash log thing to work.</p>

<p>You need to convert to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bytes" rel="nofollow">bytes</a>:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">At which line are you getting the error, could you paste the whole traceback?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes I can. Adding now</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Added the edit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like irc.send likely only accepts byte-encoded data, not strings. You have to convert the string before passing it to irc.send.  See this question's answers: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11781639/typeerror-str-does-not-support-buffer-interface" title="typeerror str does not support buffer interface">stackoverflow.com/questions/11781639/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">After doing this, I got this error. <a href="http://imgur.com/IWA43LB" rel="nofollow noreferrer">imgur.com/IWA43LB</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You also need to decode</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh yeah... I forgot to add the decoding part! Sorry!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So currently now, I am running on the code that was submitted by Padric, and now its just a blank screen and it doesnt crash or anything. I also removed the splitting code. If I need to add that back I can.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EduCodes, forgot the <code>\r\n</code>, it will work fine now, your split will work too once you have data</span>
