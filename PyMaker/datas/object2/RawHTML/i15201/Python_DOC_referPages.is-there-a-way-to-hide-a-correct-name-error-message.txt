<p>I'm working on writing a simple function that will take the square root of a number. The user is prompted to provide a integer. However, if they provide a string--I'd like there to be a message "You did not give me a number".  </p>
<p>See code below: </p>
<pre><code>def square(n):
    """Takes a square root of a number :rtype : int """
    if n == int(n):
        return pow(n, 2)

try:
    answer = int(input("...."))
except ValueError:
    print("You did not give me a number!")

final_answer = "{} squared is {}".format(answer, square(answer))
print(final_answer)
</code></pre>
<p>Works okay with a integer: </p>
<pre><code>....9
9 squared is 81
</code></pre>
<p>With a string: </p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
File , line 28, in &lt;module&gt;
final_answer = "{} squared is {}".format(answer, square(answer))
NameError: name 'answer' is not defined

You did not give me a number!
</code></pre>
<p>The error makes perfect sense since answer isn't defined. However, is there a way to just print/return the exception "You did not give me a number" without the NameError message?</p>
<p>Thank you for you help! </p>
</div>

<p>You can add an <code>else</code> block to the end of  your <code>try/except</code>:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    answer = int(input("...."))
except ValueError:
    print("You did not give me a number!")
else:
    final_answer = "{} squared is {}".format(answer, square(answer))
    print(final_answer)
</code></pre>
<p>The code inside the <code>else</code> block will only be run if the <code>try</code> block completes successfully.  Here is a link to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> for more information.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I had else before, but I didn't indent it correctly :)</span>
