<p>Also, if you use <code>input()</code> <code>width</code> and <code>length</code> will be strings, but they need to be typecast.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.forward" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Specifically</a>, length needs to be an integer or float and width must be a positive integer.</p>
<pre><code>length = None
while not length:
    try:
        length = float(input('Enter your preferred turtle line length: '))
    except ValueError:
        print('You need to enter a number')

width = None
while not width:
    try:

</code></pre>
<p>The code I have here will use a loop to get the proper input from the user.  It will try to reject bad inputs.  For example, if the user types 'pumpkin' when you are asking for the length.</p>
<p>Similarly, the way I am catching problems with the length and width entries, you'll want to catch problems with user entry for the shape and color.  Make sure the user enters a valid color.  Make sure the shape is in the list of allowable shapes.</p>
<p>The last problem is that your code here is not indented properly.  You need to indent after the <code>if:</code> and <code>else:</code> clauses.</p>
<p>Here is the whole program working:</p>

        print('You need to enter a color that I know.')
        color = None
shape = None
while not shape:
    shape = input('Specify whether you want to draw a line, triangle, or square: ')
    if shape.lower() not in ['line', 'triangle', 'square']:
        shape = None
        print('I only draw lines, triangles and squares!')


t.pensize(width)
if shape.lower() == 'line':

<p>Mixing command line input with turtle graphics seems a bad idea if the values you want can be obtained using the graphic input methods that the turtle module provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>textinput(title, prompt)</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>numinput(title, prompt, default=None, minval=None, maxval=None)</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are designed to prevent some of the errors that command line code needs to trap.  Here's your program rewritten with graphic input methods:</p>
<pre><code>from turtle import Turtle, Screen, TurtleGraphicsError

screen = Screen()

length = None
while not length:
    length = screen.numinput('Select Length', 'Enter your desired line length:', minval=1)

width = None

<p>your else conditional has a grammatical error : <code>t.forwad(length)</code> instead of <code>t.forward(length)</code></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are using Python 3.x, and <code>input()</code> there returns a string, not a float.
You need to cast the result before using it as a number:</p>
<pre><code>length = float(input('Enter your preferred line length: '))
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that somewhere inside <code>turtle</code> class, <code>length</code> is multiplied by a floating-point number. If <code>length</code> itself would be a number, everything would be ok. But in your case, <code>length</code> is a string, so Python has to perform <code>string * float</code>. Now, <code>string</code> is treated as a sequence of characters. In Python, it is valid to multiply a sequence by integer (<code>'ab'*3</code> = <code>'ababab'</code>), but not by other types (in particular, by float). That's why you get this error message about multiplying sequence by non-int type.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think you rinput variables, .e.g. length are all strings. make them floats or intigers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's python3 Adam, you can see it in the traceback</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>length</code> must be an int or a float. <code>width</code> must be a "positive number". <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.forward" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.forward</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@HÃ¥kenLid Interesting, because the traceback seems to show he used a <code>float</code> and it's throwing an error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the problem is the sequence, not the float. <code>str * float</code> doesn't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your shape input testing logic is flawed as it will accept TRIANGLE but then draw a square.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good catch, fixed it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why would you downvote this ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That was an issue, thank you, but I still have the error can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you're misunderstanding the error slightly. <code>__mul__</code> is complaining that he's doing <code>[some, sequence] * some_float</code>. What's <code>[0, 1, 2] * 1.5</code>? :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>"1.5" * 1.5</code> also raises the same error: <code>TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right. More precisely, it complains about <code>self[0]*other</code>, where <code>self[0]</code> is <code>turtle._orient[0]</code> and <code>other</code> is <code>length</code>. I presume that one of them is string (which is a sequence of characters), and it is very likely that the culprit is <code>length</code> :)</span>
