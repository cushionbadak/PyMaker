<p>Providing that I have this list which contains a number IP addresses:</p>
<pre><code>IpAddresses = ["192.168.0.1","192.168.0.2","192.168.0.3","192.168.0.4"]
</code></pre>
<p>Then after receiving a packet I want to check if its source address is included in the predefined list IpAddresses</p>
<pre><code>data, address = rxsocket.recvfrom(4096)
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried two alternatives, but both didn't work:</p>
<p>First: </p>
<pre><code>if (address in IpAddresses):
    do something
</code></pre>
<p>Then, I tried to convert address into string before making the comparison:</p>
<pre><code>str_address = str(address)
if (str_address in IpAddresses):
    do something
</code></pre>
<p>I am not familiar with python syntax, so please could you show me how to do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>if address[0] in IpAddresses:
</code></pre>
<p>since the address object appears as a tuple only the 0th index appears in your list so you should check for its existence (also you can usually skip the parenthesis on an if statement unless it makes the if statement less readable)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">try printing  <code>address</code> is it raw  byte string ? or is it ascii dot notation ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">print ("Resp IP is: ", address) gives this output:                                       ('Resp IP is: ', ('192.168.0.3', 30490))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please use <code>code</code> formatting in your question and provide the specific comparison and output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems that "address" is tuple that contains both address and port.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you are using Python 3.x, you might want to checkout <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ipaddress</a> and this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/ipaddress.html#ipaddress-howto" rel="nofollow noreferrer">intro</a>.  It could be helpful, particularly if you have more sophisticated processing in mind down the road.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It works now, thank you.</span>
