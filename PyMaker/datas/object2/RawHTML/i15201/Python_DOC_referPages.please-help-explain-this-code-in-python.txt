<pre><code>import os 

for dirname, dirnames, filenames in os.walk('# I will have a directory here'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print (os.path.join(dirname, filename))
</code></pre>
<p>It is meant to print the directory for some files in Python. But apart form that I know little... Thanks... There are other pages with the code but it didn't fully explain it in a 'guide for dummies 'style.. So I was a little confused. Thanks for your help..:)</p>

<p>i'll give it a shot, hope this helps.</p>
<pre><code>import os 
#   vvvvvvv directory name of the current position in the walk (eg, /var then /var/log then /var/log/apache2, etc)
#            vvvvvvvv list (array) of sub directories
#                      vvvvvvvvv list (array) of files
for dirname, dirnames, filenames in os.walk('# I will have a directory here'): # loops through the directories list
    for filename in filenames: #loops through the files returned by the previous for loop
      print (os.path.join(dirname, filename)) # join the directory and the filename returning something like /var/log/dmesg.log
