<p>I have a textfile and it looks like this :</p>
<pre><code>zor:10
zor:21
bob:30
qwerty:46
</code></pre>
<p>I want it to look like <code>{'zor': [10, 21,], 'bob': [30]}</code>  etc but the numbers keep getting replaced when I add multiple scores to a name I split the scores so that the names and scores are in separate positions.</p>
<pre><code>elif schClass == '2':
     schClass = open("scores2.txt", 'r')
     li = open("scores2.txt", 'r')
     data = li.read().splitlines()
     for li in data:
        name = li.split(":")[0]
        score = li.split(":")[1]
        if name not in diction1:
            diction1[name] = score
        elif name in diction1  :
            diction1[name] = diction1[name + int(score)]
            print(diction1)

<p>You are not building lists; simply use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.setdefault" rel="nofollow"><code>dict.setdefault()</code> method</a> to insert a list object when the key is missing, and append your values:</p>
<pre><code>diction1 = {}
with open("scores2.txt", 'r') as infile:
    for line in infile:
        name, _, score = line.partition(':')
        diction1.setdefault(name, []).append(int(score))
</code></pre>
<p>I took the liberty to clean up your code a little; I'm using the file as a context manager so that it is closed again automatically. By looping directly over the file you get individual lines, no need to split first. And I used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.partition" rel="nofollow"><code>str.partition()</code></a> to split just the once (it is more efficient for that case than <code>str.split()</code> is).</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from io import StringIO
&gt;&gt;&gt; sample = '''\
... zor:10
... zor:21
... bob:30
... qwerty:46
... '''
&gt;&gt;&gt; diction1 = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; with StringIO(sample) as infile:
...     for line in infile:
...         name, _, score = line.partition(':')
...         diction1.setdefault(name, []).append(int(score))
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; diction1
{'bob': [30], 'qwerty': [46], 'zor': [10, 21]}

<span class="comment-copy">Looks like simple typo: <code>diction1[name] = diction1[name + int(score)]</code> should be <code>diction1[name] = diction1[name] + int(score)</code> But aren't you getting a <code>KeyError</code> this way?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes I am and none of them seem to work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@andreapirlo You don't need the <code>elif name in diction1:</code> statement, just <code>else:</code> would do, but see @Martijn Pieters answer which solves lots more problems you have.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please don't change your original question; your question is supposed to be useful for future visitors too. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why does it say open twice?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@andreapirlo: because <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/21215266#21215266">I made a typo</a> that has since been corrected.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have edited the main bit but it doesn't work why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@andreapirlo: define <i>doesn't work</i> here? Perhaps you made a typo?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no I never the scores don't get printed out I added print(diction1) but the textfile does not print at alll</span>
