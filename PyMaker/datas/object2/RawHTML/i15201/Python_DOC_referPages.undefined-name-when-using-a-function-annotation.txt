<p>I am trying to express time in terms of <code>hh:mm</code>. I know that the colon is telling python to count from hours to minutes but that is not what I want.  Can someone explain a way to correct this mistake of mine?</p>
<pre><code>def extract_hours(hours:minutes):
    """returns an integer representing the number of hours number, number -&gt; number"""
    return (hours)
</code></pre>
<p>This is the error I get:</p>
<pre><code>NameError: name 'minutes' is not defined
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions" rel="nofollow">Function annotations</a> need to be valid <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#expressions" rel="nofollow">expressions</a>.  Meaning, you cannot use an undefined name in an annotation or else you will raise a <code>NameError</code>.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use a string literal:</p>
<pre><code>def extract_hours(hours:'minutes'):
</code></pre>
<p>This works because string literals are expressions.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How is your proposed function called? It seems you are <i>trying</i> to say <code>def hr(tm:'hours:minutes'):  return int(tm.split(':')[0])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah, I have to keep the format as 'hours:minutes' and I tried your solution but it gave me a syntax error for the colon...?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried that, and got: TypeError: extract_minutes() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is a problem with the caller, not the definition.  Unless of course <code>extract_hours</code> is actually supposed to take <i>two</i> arguments.  In that case, you need to define it as <code>def extract_hours(hours, minutes):</code> with a <code>,</code> instead of a <code>:</code>.</span>
