<p>I want to find the difference between two times such as (05:33, 16:01).  So I know I need to write a script that will do that, and I can do that with these def's:</p>
<pre><code>def diff_minutes(start_time, end_time):
    """returns the difference of two inputs

    number, number -&gt; number"""
    return int(start_time - end_time)


def hours_and_minutes_str(hours, minutes):
    """returns a string that represents the time span, including units

    number, number -&gt; str"""
    print (hours, 'hours'  , minutes , "minutes")

def hours_and_minutes_to_minutes(hours, minutes):
    """returns the total minutes of the input

    number, number -&gt; number"""
    return (hours * 60 + minutes)

def minutes_to_hours_and_minutes(minutes):
    """returns two numbers given just a number of minutes

    number, number -&gt; number"""
    return (int(minutes/60), minutes%60)

def extract_hours(tm:'hours:minutes'):
    """returns an integer representing the number of hours

    number, number -&gt; number"""
    return int(tm.split(':')[0])

def extract_minutes(tm:'hours:minutes'):
    """returns an integer representing the number of minutes

    number, number -&gt; number"""
    return int(tm.split(':')[1])

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>If you only have hours and minutes, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects" rel="nofollow"><code>timedelta</code></a> which is pretty straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import timedelta
&gt;&gt;&gt; t1 = timedelta(hours=5, minutes=33)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t2 = timedelta(hours=16, minutes=1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print((t2 - t1).total_seconds())
37680.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (t2 - t1)
10:28:00
</code></pre>
<p>I don't have the actual input you're using, but seems like you know how to map the strings to the creation arguments yourself :)</p>
<p>Generally you can map strings such as <code>'05'33'</code> using <code>split</code> and <code>int</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hours, minutes = map(int, '05:33'.split(':'))
&gt;&gt;&gt; hours
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; minutes
33
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, definitely <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow">datetime</a> is what you need here. Specifically, the <code>strptime</code> function, which parses a string into a time object.</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime
s1 = '10:33:26'
s2 = '11:15:49' # for example
FMT = '%H:%M:%S'
tdelta = datetime.strptime(s2, FMT) - datetime.strptime(s1, FMT)
</code></pre>
<p>That gets you a <code>timedelta</code> object that contains the difference between the two times. You can do whatever you want with that, e.g. converting it to seconds or adding it to another <code>datetime</code>.</p>

<p>I highly recommend using the standard Python libraries for this. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow">Python reference</a>.</p>
<pre><code>import datetime

time1 = '05:33'
time2 = '16:01'

format = '%H:%M'
datetime1 = datetime.datetime.strptime(time1, format)
datetime2 = datetime.datetime.strptime(time2, format)

minutes = (datetime2 - datetime1).seconds / 60
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It would be far easier to just convert them into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime</code></a> objects.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">could i change the format of t1 to hh:mm?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure what you're asking... Do you need help in creating the <code>timedelta</code> objects' constructing arguments? If so, provide the text you're parsing in your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah, I'm not really sure if I need to just copy that into my script, or what.  pretty much at a stand still</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what does your input look like? <b>add the input and output to your question</b></span>
<span class="comment-copy">t1 = timedelta(5:33) t2 = timedelta(16:01) Is this acceptable to use? because it has to be in that format</span>
<span class="comment-copy">are the s1 and s2 parts for the input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes,, you can make them a user input, or you can insert them in your code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why did you include seconds? is that critical for my problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you subtract two datetimes in Python you get a timedelta. The timedelta object allows you to retrieve days and seconds. Since you seemed to want minutes, based on your code samples, I converted the timedelta.seconds to minutes. Note that having times without dates may do interesting things as you cross day boundaries.</span>
