<p>My question is how I'd be able to add the minutes and calculate them into hours and minutes.  </p>
<p>Here some code that I have:</p>
<pre><code>import math

def main():   

    total = 0
    for i in range (number):
        task = int(input('How many minutes will this task take? '))
        print(task)
        total += task
    print(total)
    hour = total // 60
    minute = hour % 0
    print('Hour(s): ', hour, 'Minute(s): ', minute)

main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are <em>almost there</em>. Your calculation method is also incorrect; you want the remainder of <code>total</code> and <code>60</code>, not of <code>hours</code> and <code>0</code>:</p>
<pre><code>hour = total // 60
minute = total % 60
</code></pre>
<p>The remainder of <code>hour</code> and <code>0</code> is always going give you a <code>ZeroDivisionError</code> as you cannot divide by 0.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod" rel="nofollow"><code>divmod()</code> function</a> can give you both the hours and the minutes in <em>one step</em>:</p>
<pre><code>hour, minute = divmod(total, 60)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you know how to convert from a number representing minutes, to two numbers representing hours and minutes? On paper for example? Say you have the number 146, how many hours are in there, and ho many minutes remaining?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters 146 minutes would be 2 hours and 26 minutes, I believe.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So how would you go about calculating that if the number was instead written down as <code>x</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters So <code>x  = 146</code>? Then I guess 146 divided by 60 which would be 2 hours and then the minutes would be the remainder; 26 minutes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you think you can code that up in Python? There are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-arithmetic-operations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">several arithmetic operators</a> you could use here. Division and remainder are both among them, if you read the documentation carefully you may even find <b>one</b> function that can do the job here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, it most of done that b/c in the code it's inside.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MaxSedor: perhaps fix that part of your code then? You also forgot to give us some sample input, the output you expected and what you got instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'll add that, once I edit.  I'll get back to you soon as possible!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MaxSedor: your version will give you an error message. Always include the full traceback for such errors (so starting with <code>Traceback (most recent call last)</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you soo much!  It worked!!  I typed in 400 minutes then 300 and it added them together to make 700 minutes.  Then gave me 11 hours and 40 minutes! Thanks so much!  It took me so long to do this and I owe to both of you!!! @MartijnPieters</span>
