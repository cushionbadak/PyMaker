<p>I'm trying to iterate a certain number of lines from a text file. I've tried doing so by using different combinations of <code>i += 1</code> and <code>for</code> loops, but it just seems to print out all of the lines from the text file.</p>
<pre><code>def showEntries(amount):
    print("---------- SUBSCRIPTIONS ----------\n")
    with open('lib/names.txt','r') as names:
        for line in names:
            for x in range(0,2):
                print(line)
    print("----------  END OF LIST  ----------")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you want something like:</p>
<pre><code>for line_no, line in enumerate(names):
    if line_no &gt;= amount:  # if we've seen enough already
        break  # stop looping
    print(line)  # otherwise show the current line
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; names = ["John Cleese", "Graham Chapman", "Terry Gilliam", "Eric Idle", "Terry Jones", "Michael Palin"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for index, name in enumerate(names):
    if index &gt;= 3:
        break
    print(name)


John Cleese
Graham Chapman
Terry Gilliam

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.islice()</code></a> for this.</p>

<p>I believe this is what you want to do ... </p>
<p>a. Get an email address as input from the user and add it to a file. As an aside ... you may want to do the following before you write it to the file...
 - ensure that the email address is a valid address (use regex to enforce this)
 - ensure that the email address does not exist already (you don't want a file full of duplicate addresses)
etc...</p>
<p>and,
b. Print out how a specified number of results from your subscriber list. You need to either put your </p>
<p>Here's a quick example of what you can do to read x number of lines from. I've used a lot of syntactic sugar .. which you can choose not to use.. </p>
<pre><code>def printLines(numlines):
    i = 0
    with open(file) as f:
        for line in f:
            if i &lt; numlines:
                print line
                i += 1
            else:
                break

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your code is really close â€” you just need to let the iteration of the number of lines control the loop, not the number of them in the file:</p>
<pre><code>def showEntries(amount):
    print("---------- SUBSCRIPTIONS ----------\n")
    with open('lib/names.txt', 'r') as names:
        for _ in range(amount):
            print(next(file).rstrip())
    print("----------  END OF LIST  ----------")
</code></pre>
<p>To be more robust, inner portion of the loop probably should be wrapped in a <code>try/except</code> to handle the case were the file contains less than the specified number of lines gracefully.</p>
