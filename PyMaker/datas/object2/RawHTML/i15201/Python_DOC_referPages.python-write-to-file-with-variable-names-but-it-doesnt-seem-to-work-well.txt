<p><br/> In response to the previous question, I am now trying to do something different. I am trying to write the user's name and their score to a text file that I called, just for testing purposes (newfile.txt):</p>
<p>This is the code so far:
    <br/></p>
<pre><code>file = open("newfile.txt", "w")

user_name = str(input("What is your name?"))
user_score = int(input("What score did you get?"))

file.write(user_name, ":", user_score "\n")
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to write the name and the score in the form name:score, so for instance since my name is Taylor and if I got a score of 10, I would expect the file to show Taylor : 10. 
<br/><br/>Why is this not working?</p>

<p><code>.write()</code> takes a single argument. You need to create a single string to pass. Instead of</p>
<pre><code>file.write(user_name, ":", user_score "\n")
</code></pre>
<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>str.format()</code></a> to create your string.</p>
<pre><code>file.write('{} : {}\n'.format(user_name, user_score))
</code></pre>
<p>As a side note, I would recommend using the <code>with</code> keyword to handle file opening and closing for you.</p>
<pre><code>with open("newfile.txt", "w") as f:
    user_name = str(input("What is your name? "))
    user_score = int(input("What score did you get? "))
    f.write('{} : {}\n'.format(user_name, user_score))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>How about put the content you want to write to the file in a new var? And <code>write()</code> only take a parameter of string type but <code>user_score</code> is an int type:</p>
<pre><code>file = open("newfile.txt", "w")

user_name = str(input("What is your name?"))
user_score = int(input("What score did you get?"))

content = user_name + ':' + str(user_score) + '\n'

file.write(content)

file.close() # close the file
</code></pre>
<p>Besides, make sure close the file or it will not close until your program ends.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">write takes a single string.  you can add strings together with <code>+</code>.  also <code>user_score</code> needs to be converted to a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For future reference, your code produces a syntax error. So when you say  your code is "not working" you should post the full traceback with the error so people know what you are referring to specifically.</span>
