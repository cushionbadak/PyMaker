<p>I am using pass-by-reference to change the case of strings in a list. This code seems not to be working:</p>
<pre><code>def test(the_list):
    for word in the_list:
        word.lower()

the_list=["Python", "Programming"]
test(the_list)
print the_list

<p>is this what you are trying to accomplish?</p>
<pre><code>def test(the_list):

the_list=["Python", "Programming"]
test(the_list)
print the_list

<p>You can do that using a for loop, but it is much faster and more readable to use the bulit-in list comprehensions:</p>
<pre><code>the_list=["Python", "Programming"]
the_list = [x.lower() for x in the_list]
print the_list

<span class="comment-copy">Strings are immutable in Python. You cannot change them in-place, even if you pass them "by reference".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"(In Python) arguments are passed using call by value (where the value is always an object reference, not the value of the object) [...] Actually, call by object reference would be a better description, since if a mutable object is passed, the caller will see any changes the callee makes to it (items inserted into a list)." <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ Evan Mosseri. That is correct.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ no_nome.  Did that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">watch out for this with large datasets though because instead of putting one list into memory you are putting two</span>
