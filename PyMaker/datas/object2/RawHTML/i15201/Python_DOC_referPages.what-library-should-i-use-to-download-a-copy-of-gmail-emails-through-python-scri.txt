<p>In a python script, i want to be able to connect to the gmail server, and then download all my emails into a single .mbox file. Is this possible? If so, what library is used and where can i get it from? Thanks</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html" rel="nofollow">imaplib</a> from Python standard library.</p>
<pre><code>import imaplib
gmail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')
gmail.login('username@gmail.com', 'password')
...
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox" rel="nofollow">mbox</a> format usually means just that the messages are catenated after each other, with the caveat that each line that starts with <code>From</code> needs to be escaped with <code>&gt;</code>, very easy to write out by hand from Python script, though also supported by standard library with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html" rel="nofollow">mailbox.mbox</a></p>

<p>Standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/imaplib.html" rel="nofollow">imaplib</a> is working fine for me. Another standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/mailbox.html" rel="nofollow">mailbox</a> could be useful as well.</p>
