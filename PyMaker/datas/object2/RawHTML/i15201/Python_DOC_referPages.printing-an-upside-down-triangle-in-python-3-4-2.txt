<p>So, for my programming class I am supposed to write a program that outputs this: </p>
<pre><code>oooooo
ooooo
oooo
ooo
oo
o
</code></pre>
<p>I have been able to make it so that the program outputs the triangle right side up but even after looking for help online, I haven't been able to find the solution to turning the triangle upside down. Here is my code: </p>
<pre><code>def main():

base_size = 6

for r in range (base_size):
    for c in range (r + 1):
        print('o', end = '')
    print()

main()
</code></pre>
<p>And this is the output I get:</p>
<pre><code>o
oo
ooo
oooo
ooooo
oooooo
</code></pre>
<p>Can someone help me out? I am a newbie so this is kind of tough for me even though it's probably pretty simple for you guys.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance! </p>

<p>You're very close. You can use the <code>range</code> function, but step using <code>-1</code> to walk from <code>n</code> to <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>You can also make a string by multiplying a character by an integer.</p>
<pre><code>def triangle(n):
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        print('o' * i)
</code></pre>
<p>Testing</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; triangle(6)
oooooo
ooooo
oooo
ooo
oo
o
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Range with a negative step will do the trick (end, ini, step) with step=-1, also you can eliminate one for loop by using lists and join instead:</p>
<pre><code>def trig(base):
   for i in range(base, 0, -1):
       l = ['o']*i
       print(''.join(l))
</code></pre>
<p>Edit: @Cyber answer is much better, didn't know you could use "times" operator directly at the string.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">as a trick, you can use <code>range</code>'s <code>step</code> argument to step backwards through a range. <code>range(10, 0, -1)</code> will give you <code>10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#reversed" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reversed</a> function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hint: The <code>step</code> argument to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">range</a> can be negative.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SethMMorton -- Congrats for thinking differently than the other commentors -- I actually like your suggestion :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DSM a few typos -- apparently I don't know how to use <code>range</code>. I got it there eventually! :)</span>
