<p>I'm currently porting some Python 2 code that was being run with pypy over to python 3. I'm a bit stuck with dealing with some code that uses <code>_multiprocessing</code> as the documentation is hard to find for this.</p>
<pre><code>from _multiprocessing import address_of_buffer
#example usage
def buffer_info(self):
    return address_of_buffer(self._mmap)[0], self._size
</code></pre>
<p>When I attempt to use this code into Python3.4 I get a problem with the import:</p>
<pre><code>ImportError: cannot import name 'address_of_buffer'
</code></pre>
<p>After having a quick look at the Python 3 docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html</a> I'm not seeing a direct replacement for this. What is the best way to port this code?</p>

<p>You can use ctypes:</p>
<pre><code>def address_of_buffer(buf):
    return ctypes.addressof(ctypes.c_char.from_buffer(buf))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I think that this does what I need so I upvoted, I haven't quite got the code that this uses passing all tests just yet, will mark as accepted when all the tests pass.</span>
