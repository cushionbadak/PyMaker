<p>I'm moving my code from Flask to Falcon and a small annoyance is that I can't seem to find way to run my Falcon-based app from the <code>__main__</code> method. In my Flask app I had this:</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=os.getenv('PORT', 5000))
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to do the same for the Falcon app? I don't mind to use a wrapper like Gunicorn but that one also seems to not run (easily) from the <code>__main__</code> as well</p>
<p><em>Note: This is strictly for development purposes, I know how to run the Falcon app in production</em></p>

<p>Sure use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/wsgiref.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>wsgiref</code></a>, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>from wsgiref import simple_server

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with simple_server.make_server('', os.getenv('PORT', 5000), app) as httpd:
        httpd.serve_forever()
</code></pre>
