<p>I have a basic web page running and I have web scraped some temperatures for the week. The output on the page is displaying perfect on the web page. I now want to input these into my SQLite3 database. I've tried finding some tutorials but couldn't find any clear ones. Can someone guide me on the right path? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I know that this question already has an accepted answer which will work for your purposes, but I just want to mention that you should always use query parameters rather than string formatting to create SQL statements with variables. So instead of:</p>
<pre><code>curs.execute("INSERT INTO your_table_name low_temp='{}'".format(low_temp))
</code></pre>
<p>You should use:</p>
<pre><code>curs.execute("INSERT INTO your_table_name low_temp=?", (low_temp,))
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> confirms that this is the way to go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually your SQL operations will need to use values from Python
  variables. You shouldn’t assemble your query using Python’s string
  operations because doing so is insecure; it makes your program
  vulnerable to an SQL injection attack (see <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://xkcd.com/327/</a> for
  humorous example of what can go wrong).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I realise that for this small example program it's unlikely to make any difference, but it's best to get into good habits.</p>

<p>If you want to just store your <code>low_temp</code> in database, then do a simple SQL insert</p>
<pre><code>import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.sqlite3', check_same_thread=False)

curs = conn.cursor()
curs.execute("INSERT INTO your_table_name low_temp='{}'".format(low_temp))
conn.commit()
</code></pre>
<p>I recommend you to read some <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></p>
