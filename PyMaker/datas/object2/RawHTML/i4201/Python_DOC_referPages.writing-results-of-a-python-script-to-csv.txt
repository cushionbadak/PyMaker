<p>I'm using this Amazon reviews scraper I found on Github: <a href="https://github.com/philipperemy/amazon-reviews-scraper" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/philipperemy/amazon-reviews-scraper</a></p>
<pre><code>        for review in reviews_list:

             title = review.find(attrs={'data-hook': 'review-title'}).text

<p>I want those results to be sent to a CSV file. But I'm just a beginner with Python so I'm not entirely sure. I'm using Python on Windows.</p>
<p>With the help of Akshat I've got this, but I'm not sure it's correct:</p>
<pre><code>        for review in reviews_list:
            rating = review.find(attrs={'data-hook': 'review-star-rating'}).attrs['class'][2].split('-')[-1]
            body = review.find(attrs={'data-hook': 'review-body'}).text
            date = review.find(attrs={'data-hook': 'review-date'}).text
            title = review.find(attrs={'data-hook': 'review-title'}).text

from csv import DictWriter

with open('results.csv', 'w') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['title', 'date', 'rating', 'body']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    writer.writeheader()

    for review in reviews: 
        writer.writerow(review)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your problem is here:</p>
<pre><code>    writer.writerow(title, date, rating, body)
</code></pre>
<p><code>writerow</code> expects a sequence. Do this instead:</p>
<pre><code>    writer.writerow([title, date, rating, body])
</code></pre>
<p>That line needs to be inside a loop through <code>reviews</code>.</p>

<p>Apart from the error pointed out by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50038240/4797454">@BoarGules</a>. I would suggest you to explore <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DictWriter</a> from CSV module</p>
<pre><code>from csv import DictWriter

<span class="comment-copy">Additional note - SO is not a free coding service - you have to deserve help - do your part try something - then come with problem in your code for help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is true. I updated my post to reflect it. I've just been trying anything since yesterday and have really gotten nowhere.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. So I've tried to replace the whole logging sequence with the below but it doesn't seem to work. Should it?     import csv with open('results.csv', 'w') as f:     writer = csv.writer(f, delimiter=',')     writer.writerow([title, date, rating, body])</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've added that to the script and it's telling me Traceback (most recent call last):   File "amazon_comments_scraper.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;     from core_extract_comments import *   File "C:\Users\jrath\ars\core_extract_comments.py", line 74     import DictWriter from csv                          ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax</span>
<span class="comment-copy">check now, sequence of import statement had an issue</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think I'm doing something very wrong, where should this go in my script and what should I replace with it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">once you reviews list is ready. add my code after it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I updated my original post to reflect what I have now. i'm still getting an error: Traceback (most recent call last):   File "amazon_comments_scraper.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;     from core_extract_comments import *   File "C:\Users\jrath\ars\core_extract_comments.py", line 59     from csv import DictWriter     ^ IndentationError: expected an indented block</span>
