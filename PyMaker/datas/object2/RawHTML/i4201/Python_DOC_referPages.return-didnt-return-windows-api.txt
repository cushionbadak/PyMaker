<p>Here's my code. When I run it the return statement doesn't return anything. Anyone know why?</p>
<pre><code>import win32api as win
import time
import sys
def mouse_path(run):
    path = []
    while time.clock() &lt; run:
        cords = (win.GetCursorPos())
        time.sleep(.1)
        path.append(cords)
    return path

mouse_path(10)

<p>It looks like you are running this from a .py file and not in interactive mode.  Objects that come back from a <code>return</code> statement are not displayed except in interactive mode.  Try wrapping the returned values in a <code>print</code> statement.  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">10. It's the last line in the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does your while loop ever meet the condition you set?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yup. The code evaluates for 10 seconds and then stops and returns nothing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's nothing to return to. The script exits. You have to write the return value to stdout, e.g. <code>print(mouse_path(10))</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand. Isn't python supposed to return  a list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The repr of the return value is printed in interactive mode because of the default <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.displayhook" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sys.displayhook</code></a> function.</span>
