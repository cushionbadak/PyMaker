<p>So I'm just trying to learn programming/coding. and I'm trying to make a loop where the computer guesses at random a number that I put in (the variable), I mostly the loop with the "while" and "if/else" loops down but like...idk how to put the variable in. I'm sure there are other things wrong with the code. Its just a simple one since I actually just started 2 days ago. here is the code</p>
<pre><code>input = var
x = 0
counter = 0

while x == 0:
    from random import *
    print randint(1, 3)

    if randint == var:
        x = 1
        count = counter + 1
        print (counter)
        print "Good Bye!"
    else:
        x == 0
        counter = counter + 1
        print (counter)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>if randint == var:
</code></pre>
<p>is always <code>False</code>. <code>randint</code> is the random <em>function</em>, <code>var</code> is an integer (well, it <em>should</em> be).</p>
<p>You mean:</p>
<pre><code>r = randint(1,3)
if r == var:
   ...
</code></pre>
<p>(store the result of the random function to be able to display it <em>and</em> test it, calling it again yields another value, obviously)</p>
<p>and yes, the first line should be <code>var = int(input())</code> to be able to input an integer value.</p>

<p>Updated according to the comments:</p>
<p>I just made a working version of your program, your input would be 1, and computer would randomly guess from 1,2,3 until it gives the correct answer.</p>
<pre><code>#input = var this line is wrong as pointed out by others
input =  1 # this is your input number
x = 0
counter = 0
import random

while x == 0:
    #from random import * this will import too much in the while loop according to comments

    #randint(1, 3) this line is wrong
    randint = random.randint(1, 3) # computer guess from 1-3, then you should assign random generated number to randint
    print(randint)

    # if randint == var:  this line is wrong, you can't compare randint to var.
    if randint == input: #
        x = 1
        count = counter + 1 
        print(counter)
        print("Good Bye!")
    else:
        x = 0
        counter = counter + 1
        print(counter)
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>3
1
1
1
Good Bye!

Process finished with exit code 0

<span class="comment-copy"><code>randint == var</code> cannot be true, you're comparing the <i>function</i> with an integer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>input</code> is a built-in function. Don't assign <code>var</code> to it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, there are some key problems with your code. I suggest stepping away from your code for a bit and taking the time to learn the fundamentals of Python. A good place to start would be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/#the-python-tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>The Python Tutorial</i></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>from random import *</code> is BAD, and even more within a loop.</span>
