<p>Now let me start off by saying that I know bs4, scrapy, selenium and so much more can do this but that isnt what I want for numerous reasons. </p>
<p>What I would like to do is open a webbrowser (chrome, ie, firefox) and extract the html from the page after loading the site in that web browser from what webbrowser. </p>
<pre><code>import webbrowser
import time


class ScreenCapture:
    url = 'https://www.google.com/'
    webbrowser.get("C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe %s").open(url)

    # get html from browser that is open
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is no need to bother a webbrowser with this. If you just want to get the HTML of a website you can simply use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/urllib.request.html?highlight=urlretrieve#urllib.request.urlopen" rel="nofollow noreferrer">urllib.request.urlopen</a>.</p>
<pre><code>from urllib.request import urlopen
with urlopen(url) as f:
   html = f.read()
print(html)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>webbrowser</code></a> module is only for displaying HTML (etc) in your browser, it doesn't allow you to extract anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As @PM2Ring mentioned <code>webbrowser</code> is a high level module simply dealing with displaying web pages on browsers and it's functionality is limited to that only. Can you explain why do you need to do this task using this module only?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the issue is one of the sites I am trying to go to will through a 456 at me using urlopen, scrapy, bs4 or selenium. But doesnt when I us the webbrowser open</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you try requests too?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think it won't work when the page is being generated dynamically. Don't you think so?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If the content is dynamic or not depends on the server side. He didn't say anything about JavaScript so I assume he doesn't need any interaction with the Webbrowser. In this case <code>urlopen</code> is a straight-forward solution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When he said that he specifically wants to use a browser to open a web page I assumed that he needs to open a web browser first and then open a webpage and download the html of it. So the only case where end result might be different is when the page is dynamically generated. I might be overthinking this your approach is quite relevant too.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@AlexD Did you try to set a user agent for the request?</span>
