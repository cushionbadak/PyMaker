<p>I am getting a <code>KeyError: 'About Me'</code>. I have figured out that the dump Data of Stackoverflow for Users contain some User that doesn't have an AboutMe Variable. The iteration through the xml['AboutMe'] works fine. But If some User has not an AboutMe Variable, the script crashes and give me an KeyError.</p>
<p>I try to check if AboutMe is contained. If it is it should print the AboutMe without HTML Tag out.</p>
<p>If it is not contained. It should assign the value None to this entry.</p>
<p>That is my <strong>Code</strong>:</p>
<pre><code> if element['AboutMe'] is not None:
    cleanAboutMe = BeautifulSoup(element['AboutMe'], "lxml").text
    print(cleanAboutMe)
else:
    element = {'AboutMe':'None'}
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>output</strong> that I get:</p>

I'm not takin' my sneakers off!
if element['AboutMe'] is not None:
KeyError: 'AboutMe'
</code></pre>
<p>I hope you guys can help. I search and try every asked Question in Stackoverflow but None helped me. I get everytime this Key Error. </p>
<p>A little Note: The variable Element does work fine but if I pointing to the AboutMe Key then I get the Error.</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

<p>If the element might not have that attribute, use <code>element.get('AboutMe')</code> to get the attribute value or None if the attribute is not present.  <code>get</code> is a standard function for ElementTree implementations.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.Element.get" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.Element.get</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">try using <code>element.get('AboutMe')</code> - it will return <code>None</code> if the key is missing.</span>
