<p>If I wanted to specify a path to save files to and make directories that don’t exist in that path, is it possibly to do this using the pathlib library in one line of code? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, that is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.mkdir" rel="noreferrer"><code>Path.mkdir</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>pathlib.Path('/tmp/sub1/sub2').mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much. Exactly what I was looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Would this work as well? <code>p = Path('./')</code> <code>q = p / 'some' / 'directory' .mkdirs()</code> ?                                               Could you do something like that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that works just as well but you’ll need parentheses around the path so that .mkdir isnt called on rightmost string object.</span>
