<p>I have a Python (2.7) file with a function. I want to call it from command line and pass optional parameters by param name.</p>
<p>In my py file, I have this function:</p>
<pre><code>def split_file(source_file_path, alt_output_path='', chunk_size=2000000): 
</code></pre>
<p>and at the bottom I have this: </p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':    
    split_file(*sys.argv[1:])
</code></pre>
<p>How can set it up to be able to call it like this?</p>
<pre><code>&gt; C:\Python27\python C:\Work\file_splitter.py "C:\Work\files\myfile.txt" alt_output_path="C:\EBI\Work\files\alt"
</code></pre>
<p>I've looked at <code>argparser</code> and it's a bit confusing to me. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should work:</p>
<pre><code>to_split_args = [a.split("=") for a in sys.argv[1:]]
args = [a[0] for a in to_split_args if len(a) == 1]
kwargs = dict(a for a in to_split_args if len(a) == 2)
split_file(*args,**kwargs)
</code></pre>
<p>But you should really look into argparser</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Then try to work with argparser and ask question about that. It is the best way to do it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are some good third-party getting-started tutorials for <code>argparse</code>. (Unfortunately, there are also some horrible ones that are just effectively spam to get you to read targeted ads, because that's how the internet works nowadaysâ€¦ but I think most of the top hits on Google, or the links on any reputable site, will be good ones.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But meanwhile, have you even tried the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official <code>argparse</code> tutorial</a> from the HOWTOs docs? It's a whole lot easier to get the idea from that, than from reading the reference manual and trying to work out what the examples mean.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you took out the <code>alt_output_path=</code>, your attempt would be almost correct. Though needing to coerce <code>chunk_size</code> from string to integer is a potential issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The OP's code expects <code>chunk_size</code> to be an integer; as I read this, it would end up a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good enough for now, thank you sir!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I took care of the integer issue in code.</span>
