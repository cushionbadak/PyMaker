<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That is what I get when I try to pip install http.cookiejar<br/>
My Python version is 3.6.2, my pip version is 10.X, my OS is Windows 8.1 64 bit, other modules installed without issues.<br/>
I searched my error output on stackoverflow and it seems I first run into this problem<br/>
How to fix that?</p>
