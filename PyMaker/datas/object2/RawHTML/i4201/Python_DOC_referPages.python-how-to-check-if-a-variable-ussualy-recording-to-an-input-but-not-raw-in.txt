<p>I'm new at stackoverflow and learning python now. I have a question and searched for it everywhere but couldn't find anything suits my idea.</p>
<p>So the problem is I want to check if an input (or variable) is a letter or a word or contains any letters. For an example, if the variable or respond of input is a it will return False but if the respond or variable is made of just numbers it will respond True.</p>
<p>I really am new in python and don't know so much commands so if there is an existing command (Or tag) which is doing just my work pls don't blame me! Thx by now and here is the code I wanted to test if the input is a letter because it was going to give an error if 
 a letter put in. </p>
<pre><code>import random
import time
repeat= True
none="none"
shutdowntime=3
repeatshut=True
def roll(count):
  print "&gt;Rolls are these:"
  while count&gt;0:
    print random.randint(1,6)
    count-=1  
while repeat==True:
  count=input("=&gt;How many rolls do you want to roll?")
  if count!=none:
    roll(count)
  else:
    repeat=False

if repeat==False:
  print "=&gt;Thank you for using my dice roll."
  while repeat==False and repeatshut==True:
    print "%d seconds to shut down." % (shutdowntime)
    shutdowntime-=1
    time.sleep(1)
    if shutdowntime==0:
      repeatshut=False
      print "Shutting down..."
      time.sleep(2)
      print "Bye!"
</code></pre>

<p>From your code it is visible that you want your code to stop when the user inputs none and give output when the user inputs a digit.Until that you want to keep taking inputs.
code:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
import random
import time
repeat= True
none="none"
shutdowntime=3
repeatshut=True
def roll(count):
  print ("&gt;Rolls are these:")
  while count&gt;0:
    print (random.randint(1,6))
    count-=1  
while repeat==True:
    while True:
        try:
            count=input("=&gt;How many rolls do you want to roll?")
            x=int(count)
            roll(x)
        except Exception:
            if count==none:
                repeat=False
                break
            else:
                print("Enter valid choice")       

if repeat==False:
  print ("=&gt;Thank you for using my dice roll.")
  while repeat==False and repeatshut==True:
    print ("%d seconds to shut down." % (shutdowntime))
    shutdowntime-=1
    time.sleep(1)
    if shutdowntime==0:
      repeatshut=False
      print ("Shutting down...")
      time.sleep(2)
      print ("Bye!")
</code></pre>
<p>I have used from <strong>future</strong> import print_function since i m using python 3 and from your code it seems you are using python 2.<br/>
So this code will work for you too :)<br/>
Do tell if it worked. </p>

<p>You can use the built-in function for strings: isdigit().</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to Stack Overflow! It would have been <i>excellent</i> if you had read the introductory <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tour">Tour</a> which was suggested when signing up – it is a short overview of how the site works.

<span class="comment-copy">You are asking about identifying "words" - your code needs "ints" from your inputs.

<span class="comment-copy">BTW, you should <i>seriously</i> consider learning Python 3, Python 2 will reach its official End Of Life in 2020. But in the mean time, please do <b>not</b> use Python 2's <code>input</code> function, it is a big security hole. Use <code>raw_input</code> instead. In Python 3, <code>raw_input</code> has been renamed to <code>input</code>, and the old <code>input</code> function has been killed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It did work thanks. But I did not understand why there is a brake in the line 26?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry i just edited everything above your break stmt.Forgot to remove it.This is new soln.If it did work for would you plz mark my ans accepted :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem but is there a chance that we can turn an input (which will return a variable) into a part of a string? I'm going to use it if it can be done this way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">like  input is equal to a and no matter what a is I want to have a string "a" within it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">input always gives you a string value even if your entered input is digit.If that is what you are asking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Interesting – for common purposes this will work, but "This covers digits which cannot be used to form numbers in base 10, like the Kharosthi numbers" suggests that it used actually the <i>Unicode</i> classification of the input string. Which means it will accept <code>Ⅻ</code>. I think I'm going to try and see what happens.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay – testing against selected characters from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerals_in_Unicode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Numerals in Unicode</a> shows ... mixed results. <code>int('६')</code> works (it is the Devanagari numeral '6'), but <code>int('①')</code> fails, even though this function <i>says</i> it is a valid digit. (Alas: <code>¾</code> fails the <code>isdigit</code> test, and so does <code>Ⅷ</code>. The first <i>may</i> make sense but for the latter, even if the combo fails, the singular <code>Ⅴ</code> is a "digit" in Roman numerals and it also fails.) The official documentation may need expanding on what's valid and what's not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree with you... this function is working only for general purposes. It works only with positive integers; not float! If you try <code>"-1".isdigit()</code>and <code>"1.1".isdigit()</code> it will always return <code>False</code>...</span>
