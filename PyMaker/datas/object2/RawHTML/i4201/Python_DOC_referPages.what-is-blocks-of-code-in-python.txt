<p>A code block is a Group of statements that will be run as a Unit.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>if (condition):
    #statement1
    #statement2
    #statement3
else:
    #statement4
    #statement5
    #statement6
</code></pre>
<p>You will find that <strong>statements 1,2,3</strong> will have the same indentation therefore is of the same block. 
and similarly <strong>statements 4,5,6</strong> is of a another block.</p>

<p>When we say "block" we mean an element of code nested inside another syntactical element, like a method or function, or a structure like <code>if</code> or <code>for</code>.</p>
<p>The exact definition depends on your language's syntax tree, something that's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics" rel="nofollow noreferrer">formally defined</a>.</p>

<p>All of your programs, consist by too many blocks.
Block is just a concept and you can't see like as function. 
Block is structure of code to separate part of code from another part of code.
Function is block., classes is block and self consist by many blocks inside. </p>
