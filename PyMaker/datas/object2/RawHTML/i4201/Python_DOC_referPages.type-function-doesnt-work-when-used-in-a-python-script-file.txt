<p>I wrote a program of two lines in python. At first I tested it in the python shell. Here it is:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;state=True
&gt;&gt;&gt;type(state)
&lt;class 'bool'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The output was as I expected in the shell. 
And then I wrote these instructions in a file named main.py.</p>
<pre><code>#---------------main.py----------------#
state=True
type(state)
</code></pre>
<p>Then I executed this program using linux terminal as root user. The output was nothing</p>
<pre><code>[manjaro ~]# python main.py
[manjaro ~]# 
</code></pre>
<p>I expected that the output would be as it was in the shell. As a beginner In python I don't know why there was no output. Please help me to understand why there was no output.</p>

<p>What you see is the raw representation of the object which is returned by <code>__repr__</code> method of the respective object. It's what is called when you type an object in Python's interactive shell. When you're in a file you need to print the result using <code>print</code> function that triggers the <code>__str__</code> method.</p>
<pre><code>state=True
print(type(state))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You can take a look at the answers in the dupe - together with KAsramds answer this should clairfy things. if not, ask by comment</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The interactive shell is a Read–Eval–Print Loop. Printing is automatic in the shell. You may need to use the <code>print()</code> function in a Python script to display output. Advise you read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Tutorial</a> to learn the basics of the language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you please explain more about <b>repr</b> method and <b>str</b>  please. I want to learn more about them from you. because unlike some awkard articles, You explained them clearly and neatly. Can you please tell more about them Please sir I request you! hope some help from you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user9218974 Well, <code>__str__</code> and <code>__repr__</code> are not such complicated methods. The documentation has already explained their functionality clearly <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__</a>. Please check the documentation and let me know if you had any further questions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for the link</span>
