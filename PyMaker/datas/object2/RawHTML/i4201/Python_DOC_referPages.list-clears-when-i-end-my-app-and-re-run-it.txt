<p>How can I define a list that is empty at first and append to it but not have it clear when I restart my app? I am using python language</p>
<p>The list has the proper values in it when the app is first ran, it is only when I restart my app that the list clears because of the empty list variable over rides the list that was just created. Thanks in advance</p>

<p>A list doesn’t get saved when closing a python program. If you want this you should save the list in a specific file and load this file everytime your python program opens. One of the basics of python is that lists, dictionairies etc don’t get saved on change or exit.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There is no reason whatsoever your variables would be magically saved and loaded. Take some time to learn the basics. Then implement save and load features should you need them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">could i save a dictionary with that list in it to a file  and get the values back that way?</span>
