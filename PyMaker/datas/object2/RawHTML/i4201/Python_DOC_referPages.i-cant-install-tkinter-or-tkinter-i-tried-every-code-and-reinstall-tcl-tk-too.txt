<p>It looks like you are on Windows, in which case you have tkinter already (if you run 2.7 or above). It seems you use Python 3 so run <code>import tkinter</code>. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#module-tkinter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></p>
<p>If you are on Linux/Mac/similar variant then you need to run <code>sudo apt-get install python3-tk</code>.  It is not a <code>pip</code> package and cannot be installed in this way.</p>
<p>If the <code>python -m tkinter</code> command fails on Windows then your installation is broken, or if on Linux/Mac/Similar then the command above should work.</p>
<hr/>
<p>On Windows there are two things that could have gone  wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your installation is broken</li>
<li>You forgot to check option for tkinter</li>
</ul>
<p>If your installation is broken then reinstalling your should work, but more likely you forgot to check the <code>tck/tk and IDLE</code> option when installing.  To check or to install re-run your installer and press <code>modify</code>.  You should see a box like the following.  Ensure then the <code>tck/tk and IDLE</code> does have a tick on it:</p>

<p>And press <code>Next</code></p>
