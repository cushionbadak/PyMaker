<p>I want to create permutations of a matrix, which has 10 rows with 70 items each.
Every item contains either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. I need to create permutations of this matrix.
The problem is that I would need to write 1400 <code>for</code> statements.
Is there a better way to do these permutations?</p>
<pre><code>matrix = [[False for i in range(0, 70)] for i in range(0, 10)]
possible_items = [True, False]
</code></pre>
<p>Edit: Loop through all possible combinations of all <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> items in the matrix.</p>

<p>I agree 100% with the comment made by @user2357112, there must be an underlying issue with your solution that prompted you to pursue such a solution.</p>
<p>However, if for any reason you do want a solution to this you might consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itertools.product</a>.</p>
<pre><code>VALUES = (True, False)
rows = itertools.product(VALUES, repeat=70)
</code></pre>
<p>This will produce all rows of 70 items of <code>VALUES</code>, I do not suggest running it.</p>
<p>You can then easily extend this to be a solution to your problem, but I repeat, this is probably <em>not</em> a good way to do this.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you give us an example of what you mean by "permutations of a matrix"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You propose to loop over 2^700 matrices. This is roughly 5000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 matrices. This is not something you can achieve; find a different way to solve your underlying problem.</span>
