<p>I'm a beginner in Python. I noticed the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html?highlight=divmod#decimal.Context.divmod" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DOC</a> said the function <strong>decimal.getcontext().divmod(x,y)</strong> <em>returns the integer part of the result.</em></p>
<p>But the code is:</p>
<pre><code>def divmod(self, a, b):
    a = _convert_other(a, raiseit = True)
    r = a.__divmod__(b, context = self)
    if r is NotImplemented:
        raise TypeError("Unable to convert %s to Decimal" % b)
    else:
        return r
</code></pre>
<p>and the <code>a.__divmod__(b, context = self)</code> is（I just paste the end of the function）:</p>
<pre><code>def __divmod__(self, other, context = None):
    #omit by me
    quotient, remainder = self._divide(other, context)
    remainder = remainder._fix(context)
    return quotient, remainder
</code></pre>
<p>Does that mean that the function returns a tuple includes quotient and remainder? If that is so, why the doc said '<em>returns the integer part of the result.</em>'</p>
<p>I tried to find that it did return to a tuple.</p>
<p>So, does the doc wrong?</p>

<p>In answer form:</p>
<p>The doc is just wrong. <code>divmod</code> does what <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod" rel="nofollow noreferrer">its builtin equivalent</a> does.</p>
