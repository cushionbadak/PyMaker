<pre><code>from time import sleep
from exchangelib import Account, Credentials

a = Account(
    'john@example.com', 
    credentials=Credentials('user', 'pass'), 
    autodiscover=True
)
while True:
    for m in a.inbox.filter(subject__contains='My Trigger', is_read=False):
        m.forward(
            subject='Fwd: My Trigger', 
            body='Hey, look at this!', 
            to_recipients=['carl@example.com']
        )
        m.is_read = True
        m.save(update_fields=['is_read'])
    sleep(60)
