<p>all,</p>
<p>The <code>numpy</code> code:</p>
<pre><code>data[...]
</code></pre>
<p>What's the function for this operator [...]?
(data is a <code>numpy</code> nd-array)</p>
<p>I've tried on searching on google, but couldn't find any usage or meaning of this operator.</p>
<p>THX!</p>

<p>Not sure if you are asking about element wise selection but here is the syntax for that. </p>
<pre><code>x = np.arange(10) 
x[2]
2
</code></pre>
<p>If I've misinterpreted, perhaps explain what the three dots are supposed to represent. </p>
<p>You may be asking for the closest function to the element wise search, in which case you should look at the take() function.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Where did you get this line from? My guess is that it's a placeholder for an array without being literal Python code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's an <code>ellipsis</code>, as documented <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/arrays.indexing.html#basic-slicing-and-indexing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might get a better answer if you show some of the code where this occurs.  For example is in an assignment?  What is the shape of <code>data</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>ellipsis</code> is a defined constant: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html</a></span>
