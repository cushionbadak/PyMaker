<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list</p>
<pre><code>s = ['www.abc.com/1/2/3', 'www.xyz.com/3/4/5', 'www.try.com/6/7/5']
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to modify the list to get following result:</p>
<pre><code>s = ['www.abc.com', 'www.xyz.com', 'www.try.com']
</code></pre>
<p>i.e. remove "/" and every character after "/" from each string in the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could split each string according to the <code>/</code> character. E.g.:</p>
<pre><code>result = [x.split('/', 1)[0] for x in s]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you need to iterate over long lists probably regex would be more efficient:</p>
<pre><code>import re
s = ['www.abc.com/1/2/3', 'www.xyz.com/3/4/5', 'www.try.com/6/7/5']
result=[re.sub('/*','',i) for i in s]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>s = [x.split('/')[0] for x in s]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried to achieve this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What about <code>'http://www.example.com'</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What about <code>'www.example.com:80/1/2/3'</code>?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Or even <code>x.split('/', 1)[0]</code> because you don't really need to split on <i>all</i> the slashes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ForceBru good point, thanks! Edited that in.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Based on the nature of the question, I bet the OP needs a clue such as "Use list comprehensions and the string split() method" for this answer to be intelligible.</span>
