<p>I've been learning about about C++ in college and one thing that interests me is the ability to create a shared header file so that all the cpp files can access the objects within. I was wondering if there is some way to do the same thing in python with variables and constants? I only know how to import and use the functions or classes in other py files. </p>

<p>First, if you've ever used <code>sys.argv</code> or <code>os.sep</code>, you've already used another module's variables and constants.</p>
<p>Because the way you share variables and constants is exactly the same way you share functions and classes.</p>
<p>In fact, functions, classes, variables, constantsâ€”they're all just module-global variables as far as Python is concerned. They may have values of different types, but they're the same kind of variable.</p>
<p>So, let's say you write this module:</p>
<pre><code># spam.py
cheese = ['Gouda', 'Edam']
def breakfast():
    print(cheese[-1])
</code></pre>
<p>If you <code>import spam</code>, you can use <code>cheese</code>, exactly the same way you use <code>eggs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import spam

# call a function
spam.eggs()

# access a variable
print(spam.cheese)

# mutate a variable's value
spam.cheese.append('Leyden')
spam.eggs() # now it prints Leyden instead of Edam

# even rebind a variable
spam.cheese = (1, 2, 3, 4)
spam.eggs() # now it prints 4

# even rebind a function
spam.eggs = lambda: print('monkeypatched')
spam.eggs()
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>C++ header files are really just a poor man's modules. Not every language is as flexible as Python, but almost every language from Ruby to Rust has some kind of real module system; only C++ (and C) requires you to fake it by having code that gets included into a bunch of different files at compile time.</p>

<p>Then you can define a function as per here:</p>

<p>You can look at example 3.9.5 in the previous link in order to understand how to create a shared variable among different object instances.</p>
