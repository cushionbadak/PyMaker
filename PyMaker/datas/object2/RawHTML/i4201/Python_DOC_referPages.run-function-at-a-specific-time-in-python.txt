<p>This is what I tried already and it doesn't open the link when the time comes. I read through the time library but I couldn't find anything to help me. My target is for the program to open a link at a time that I want. Any help appreciated.</p>

<p>Python comes built-in with a simple scheduling library called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sched</code></a> that supports this.</p>
<pre><code>import sched, time

<span class="comment-copy">I did just started a basic Python tutorial where he uses time.sleep in order to achieve the same thing but my problem is that I might not start the program at the same time as yesterday so that will mess me up. That is why i asked here, because I want to run the program and it will do my function at a time I want.</span>
