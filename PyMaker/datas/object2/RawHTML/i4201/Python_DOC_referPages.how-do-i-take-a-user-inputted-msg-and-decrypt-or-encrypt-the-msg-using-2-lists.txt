<p>How to make two functions. One to Encrypt and one to Decrypt the message and implement it in the already using code. </p>
<p>Sample of <strong>encryption</strong>: <code>'My test text is here'.upper()</code> Output: <code>UJ 8ZV8 8Z08 AV DZOZ</code></p>
<p><strong>Decrypt</strong> sample: <code>'V845X6QZO3Y6L AV 4LZV6UZ'</code> Output: <code>'STACKOVERFLOW IS AWESOME'</code></p>

<p>That is the two List above, I am New to Programming and still grasping the basics, The program needs to take the message from user and using the two lists provided decrypt and encrypt the message and display it, I have tried searching for similar questions but the soloutions are commands and methods we have not learned in class, Id appreciate any help and explanation on how to program the situation above. </p>

<p>To 'encrypt', you could do</p>
<pre><code>inp = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.1234567890'
oup = '4R5GZ32DAEXYUI6W7OV8FQL0J.H9CBNSPM1TK'
tab = str.maketrans(inp, oup)
totranslate = 'THIS.IS.THE.STRING.TO.TRANSLATE'
totranslate.translate(tab)
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.maketrans" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.maketrans()</code></a> builds a table to map the input characters to their corresponding output character.</p>
<p>This table is then used by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.translate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>translate()</code></a> to do the actual translation.</p>
<p>Do the reverse to obtain the table for decryption.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Suppose I gave you one letter to encrypt: <code>"C"</code> (1) What is the correct output? (2) Explain in precise terms why that's the correct output (3) Do you have any ideas how to translate any of that into code? Which parts are you stuck on?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Encrypting the Letter C should turn it into the number 5, I am New to programming so please bare with me, I am confused on how to take the users Message encrypt it and 0r decrypt it, Say the user entered Hello the output should be DZYY6, and if the user enters DZYY6 to decrypt the out put should be HELLO</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I understand all of that, and I will bear with you. So answer question (2): how do you know that C should be translated to 5? I know it may sound like a stupid question, but putting it in precise terms will help you solve the problem. Why <i>exactly</i> does C become 5? Why doesn't C become Q?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe it is to be the correct output because C is number 3 in the List, as in the third item to be in the list, and 5 is number 3 in the Second list, as in the third item to be in the list. I believe the solution is a For loop but I'm not sure how to implement it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, so the first question is how to write code which finds that C is the third item in the first list. Yes, a for loop is one way to do that. Do you have any idea how to get started on such a loop? It's OK if your first attempt is wrong. You can also google this specific question, instead of the broader encryption/decryption question. If you try googling it and don't find anything, tell me what keywords you searched for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great, I didn't see that you've given the same answer. <code>inp= ''.join([str(x) for x in List1])</code> <code>oup= ''.join([str(x) for x in List2])</code> To convert the list to a string.</span>
