<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a class object which is 5 integer values. I understand that for sorting you override the <code>__ls__</code> functions, but I want to be able to sort comparing any of the 5 values, so I would want to have 5 sort keys. Is there any way I can make it easier? I've thought of making a global class switch that keeps track of the correct value but is there an easier way?</p>

<p>If you want to sort by multiple things, it's probably easier not to try to build it into the class, but rather use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#key-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>key</code> parameter</a> for <code>sorted</code> when sorting and supply a different function depending on what you want to sort by.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Whats __ls__? Do you mean __eq__, __lt__, __le__, __ne__, __gt__, __ge__ ?</span>
