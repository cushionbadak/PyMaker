<p>I am running a code with <code>pdb</code></p>
<pre><code>python -m pdb somecode.py 3
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to pass a file on the command line, where I can specify the breakpoints. The code selects some dataset thought the passed parameter -- in this case <code>3</code>. I am running this script on a cluster. I know it is possible setting up <code>.pdbrc</code>, but I have some jobs running this code on different datasets (on those datasets the code works properly) and I don't want to interfere with that -- actually the other jobs are on the cluster queue and they could start anytime.</p>
<p>EDIT: would it be possible to set breakpoints, continue to next breakpoint, set a variable, continue to next breakpoint?</p>

<p>You can use <code>-c</code> option (python 3 only). Docs quote (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New in version 3.2: pdb.py now accepts a -c option that executes
  commands as if given in a .pdbrc file, see Debugger Commands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to set a breakpoint on line 3 (and go to it - second '-c' need for this):</p>
<pre><code>python -m pdb -c "b 3" -c c somecode.py 3
</code></pre>
<p>about sequence of instructions: yes, multiple -c options = multiple instructions. But it seems that with this method you cant set variables: <code>-c "aaa=1"</code> not works. You can try to use <code>alias</code> command to predefine some vars through command line args - additional manual command in pdb and all needed will be set:</p>
<pre><code>python -m pdb -c "b 3" -c c -c "alias setvars aaa=1;bbb=1" somecode.py 3
(Pdb) setvars
(Pdb) aaa
1
(Pdb) bbb
1
(Pdb)
</code></pre>
