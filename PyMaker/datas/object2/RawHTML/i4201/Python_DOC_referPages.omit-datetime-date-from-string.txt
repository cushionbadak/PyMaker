<p>The following query selects the date then three values from a database  </p>

<p>When it returns the date, it doesn't return 2018-3-29 as I would like, but instead returns "datetime.date(2018, 3, 29)"</p>

<p>When you print a list as a unit the items in the list are converted to strings using their <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__repr__</code></a> method. Instead, you want the <code>datetime.date</code> to use its <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__str__</code></a> method. There are a couple of different ways to make that happen. A fairly simple way is to use a list comprehension to convert all the items in the row into strings and then join them into a single string. Eg </p>
<pre><code>print(', '.join([str(u) for u in row]))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">How are you printing that date? <code>import datetime; d = datetime.date(2018, 3, 29); print(d)</code> prints <code>2018-03-29</code> for me.</span>
