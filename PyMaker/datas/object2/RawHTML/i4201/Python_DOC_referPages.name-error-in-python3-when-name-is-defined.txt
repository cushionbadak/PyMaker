<p>I am in spyder trying to run a fairly simple python code (python 3.6.4), but when I run the code and use the input statements, it says the names are not defined, even though they should be.</p>

<p>It also says that all of the other names in line 60 aren't defined. Thanks in advance!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are getting <code>NameError: name 'age' is not defined</code> because variables from different functions are not shared until you declare them global or you return them from one method to another.</p>

<p>Just return value from function to main method.</p>

<p>Same you need to do it for all methods,</p>
<pre><code>askHearing()
askTicket()
askFun()

<span class="comment-copy">You should read about <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/291978/short-description-of-the-scoping-rules">how scoping works in python</a>. You define <code>age</code> in the <code>askAge()</code> function, but once you leave that function the variable will not be available in <code>main()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Someone is about to learn about return values :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, you don't. Because assigning to it in the function will make it local, and that's just bad advice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aran-Fey. I was just sitting there trying to figure out how to say that :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please don't even mention global variables. They're a horrible solution for this problem. Talking about global variables here is a waste of time at best, and a newbie trap at worst.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aran-Fey thanks for suggestion.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user9705945 as per Aran-Fey suggested don't use global variable. Please consider accepting answer.</span>
