<p>I would like to be able to select the class' property by it's name. This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>class example(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.one = "1"
        self.two = "2"

x = example()
list = ["one", "two"]
# I want to get x.one here by referring to it by list[0]
</code></pre>
<p>How can I do this?</p>
<p>Worked example:</p>
<pre><code>class example(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.one = "one"
        self.two = "two"

    def test(self):
        list = ["one", "two"]
        print(getattr(self, list[1]))

x = example()

x.test()
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you are trying to access object properties by their name, try this:</p>
<pre><code>list = ['one', 'two']
print getattr(x, list[1])
