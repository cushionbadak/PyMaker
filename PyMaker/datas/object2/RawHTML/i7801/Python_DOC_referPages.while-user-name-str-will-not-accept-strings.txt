<p>My  tutor has tasked me to make an 'ID printer' i want to make the program to not accept integers when entering your name however by doing this it will not accept strings overall. My code is below.</p>
<pre><code> User_Name = ""
 def namechecker():
    print("Please Input Your name")
    User_Name = str(input(":"))
    while User_Name == "":
         print("Please input your name")
         User_Name = str(input(":"))


    while User_Name != str():
         print("Please use characters only")
         print("Please input your name")
         User_Name = input (":")

print("Thankyou, ", User_Name)
namechecker()
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Your question is very unclear. After reading it over, I think that you want to obtain a user name that only has alphabet characters in it. You can use <code>str.isalpha</code> for that:</p>
<pre><code>def getUserName():
   userName = ''
   while userName == '' or not userName.isalpha():
        userName = input('Please input your name: ')
        if not userName.isalpha():
            print('Please use alphabet characters only')
   return userName

userName = getUserName()
print('Thank you, {}'.format(userName))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to keep up with your idea of checking for numbers, you could also check if a string contains only digits with str.isdigit()</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<pre><code>def namechecker():
  User_Name = ""
  while True:
    User_Name = input("Please input your name: ") # input will always be a string
    if User_Name.isdigit(): # check if the string contains only digits // returns True or False
      print("Please use chracters only")
      continue # stay inside the loop if the string contains only digits
    else: break # leave the loop if there are other characters than digits  
  print("Thankyou, ", User_Name)

namechecker()
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this code will only ask for another input if the given string consists of <strong>only</strong> numbers. If you want to make sure a string consists of only alphabetic character you could work with string.isalpha()</p>
<pre><code>def namechecker():
  User_Name = ""
  while True:
    User_Name = input("Please input your name: ")
    if not User_Name.isalpha(): 
      print("Please use chracters only")
      continue
    else: break

  print("Thankyou, ", User_Name)
namechecker()
</code></pre>
<p>That would do the trick and no numbers are allowed in your input. However, you should read the documentation on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Built-in Types</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you simply can't do <code>str()</code> without an argument. It's unclear what you are trying to do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>str()</code> returns an empty string, it's not a method of type checking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you show me how to improve?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since <code>input()</code> returns a string in Python 3 (and you cast to it anyway), you'll never get the case where <code>User_name</code> isn't a string, if that's what you're trying to check...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could make a custom function to check if input is a number, you should <code>try</code> to cast input to <code>int</code> and if this is possible, then the input is invalid.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where would i place this?</span>
