<p>I am writing a text adventure for some fun in Python and found a cool function that prints the text to the terminal slowly:</p>
<pre><code>def print_slow(str):
for letter in str:
    sys.stdout.write(letter)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    time.sleep(0.1)
</code></pre>
<p>However, as it is writing it letter by letter if the word doesn't finish before the end of the line it will truncate it i.e:</p>
<pre><code>bla bla bla bla rea
ding.
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas I rather it do:</p>
<pre><code>bla bla bla bla
reading
</code></pre>
<p>Any easy way of doing this?</p>
<p>FULL CODE: Please ignore the bad story, this was just a proof of concept that I could get it to work! :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why the downvote? -- To the OP: It is <i>not easy</i> to do that, but it is possible, providing that the console width is fixed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not sure why it was downvoted, maybe people don't like programming for fun or text adventures :).... my bad if it is not what StackOverflow is for. I could fix the width of the program and make sure that IDLE is the same width so I can manually make sure it doesn't go over</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python 2 or Python 3? It's easier in Python 3, since you have <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.get_terminal_size" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shutil.get_terminal_size()</code></a>. Python 2 needs <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports.shutil_get_terminal_size" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>backports.shutil_get_terminal_size</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python 2, I think BoarGules has a solution. Going to try it out :)... thank you for your comment!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey, thank you ever so much. I am just testing it now. What is the 'a' for in the textwrap code? I ask as it is saying I haven't defined it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You showed your <code>print_slow()</code> function but not the code that called it. I have to pass it something to print. That something is in <code>a</code>. <code>a = "bla bla bla bla reading."</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahhh, I see. It is in a function that I wrote which is called lower in in the script. Let me quickly add all of my script so far to my original question, will take me 30 secs! Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Would it help if I expressed it <code>for line in textwrap.wrap(my_adventure_game_text_that_I_want_printed_slowly,20):</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ha, yes, perfect. Thank you very much! I will mark you as the accepted answer</span>
