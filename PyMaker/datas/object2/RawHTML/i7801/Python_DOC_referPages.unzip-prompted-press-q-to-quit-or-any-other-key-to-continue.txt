<p>I want to write a Python script to automatically unzip lots of apk files and then do static analysis. However, when I unzip some apk files, unzip prompted that "Press 'Q' to quit, or any other key to continue". </p>
<p>Because it's a script and I haven't press any key then the script hangs. Any command option can solve this problem? Or do I have to handle it in Python? Thanks in advance :D</p>

<p>You don't say what the structure looks like, but for a single use of unzip you can try this:</p>
<pre><code>echo Q | unzip myfile.zip
</code></pre>

<p>I just ran into the same thing and figured out what's causing it. Turns out, if a zip file has a zip comment attached, it will be shown, along with a prompt that hangs your script.</p>
<p>Passing <code>-q</code> to <code>unzip</code> will avoid showing the comment and any hangs, though you will lose the list of files being unzipped too. I haven't figured out how to just prevent the comment from showing up and not the rest of the stuff <code>unzip</code> prints.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How are you unzipping the files?

Otherwise, there may be an option with whatever you are using to unzip it to not request user input.</span>
