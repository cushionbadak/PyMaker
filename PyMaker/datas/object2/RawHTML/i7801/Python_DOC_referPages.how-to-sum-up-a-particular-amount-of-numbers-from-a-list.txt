<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would like to sum up a particular amount of numbers from a list. </p>
<pre><code>openBids = df_1['openBid'] 
mean = np.mean(openBids) 
std = np.std(openBids) 
rets = np.log(openBids / openBids.shift(1)) 
rets.dropna() 
round(sum(rets.dropna()), 4) # here i only want to add together the first ten numbers from the list for example
</code></pre>
<p>Can someone tell me how to do it?</p>
<p>Kind regards </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use python's list slicing (assuming <code>rets.dropna()</code> returns a list). <code>rets.dropna()[:10]</code> will be the first ten from the list.</p>
<pre><code>round(sum(rets.dropna()[:10]), 4)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried so far? Show your code and ask specific questions. Do you want to sum all numbers in a list or only a particular range, or even particular indexes?</span>
