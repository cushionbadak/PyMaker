<p>I'm trying to find a way to make an editable listview in python to be used in a terminal. </p>
<p>Basically each line of that listview will have a single word and I would like to be able to check or uncheck some words in the listview. Then, once I'm done editing I want to be able to close the listview and continue the rest of the program. How can I do this?</p>

<p>The curses library is a good way to do this. It allows you to write strings to the screen in a specific position instead of just constantly scrolling down like a typical Python program. And it has the ability to grab key  inputs so you could use arrow keys and space bar to select individual lines. </p>
<p>Because you can write strings to a specific position on the screen you can use a string like '[ ]' to represent an unselected option and '[*]' to represent a selected option. So when a user hits space you can toggle the current lines' selection status.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, that api looks interesting. It might really be what I'm looking for, now I just need to spend a few days studying it to be able to build what I want.</span>
