<p>I'm currently making myself a script on python that will pick jokes and display them to the user. I need to use a random picker to select one of the jokes on the list and display it. I have been trying this for a long time and can't seem to get it to work. Please help!</p>
<p>E.G:</p>
<pre><code>import random

random.choice joke
print random joke
^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>How can I do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm assuming you have a list of jokes. Let's imagine this is called jokeList. Start with</p>
<pre><code>from random import randint
</code></pre>
<p>and then our program might look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>randChoice = randint(0, len(jokeList)-1)
joke = jokeList[randChoice]
print(joke)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried? Where is your list? Please post your code so far.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Put all the jokes in a list and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.choice()</code></a> to select one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"not working" is not a precise enough error description for us to help you. What doesn't work? How doesn't it work? What trouble do you have with your code? Do you get an error message? What is the error message? Is the result you are getting not the result you are expecting? What result do you expect and why, what is the result you are getting and how do the two differ? Is the behavior you are observing not the desired behavior? What is the desired behavior and why, what is the observed behavior, and in what way do they differ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide a precise specification of what it is that you want to happen, including any and all rules, exceptions from those rules, corner cases, special cases, and edge cases? Can you provide sample inputs and outputs demonstrating what you expect to happen, both in normal cases, and in all the exceptions, corner cases, special cases, and edge cases? Please, also provide a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have a joke machine that will print multiple lines to make it look like a box, this is where the problem comes because i don't know how to declare a variable with multiple lines of text. (I am very new to python :P)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you are writing strings, putting in a \n makes it return to the next line down. This should allow you to span multiple lines with a single string variable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I'll test it out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do i put \n in or out of the brackets?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It should be in a string if you want it to print to the next line. You can concatenate the String "\n" to your joke strings using a +</span>
