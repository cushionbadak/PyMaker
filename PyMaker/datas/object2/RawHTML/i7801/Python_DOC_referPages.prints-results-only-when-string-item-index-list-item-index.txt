<p>I've been working on a little project of mine lately, but I've run into a problem that I'm stuck at. I've already checked various places, but I couldn't really find what I'm looking for. This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>special_alphabet = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, 
v, w, x, y, z]

alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k','l', 'm', 'n', 
'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']

name = input('Please insert your name: ')

item_alphabet = -1
item_special_alphabet = -1
index = -1

for item in name:
    item_alphabet = item_alphabet + 1
    item_special_alphabet = item_special_alphabet + 1
    index = index + 1

    if alphabet[item_alphabet] == name[index]:
        print(special_alphabet[item_special_alphabet])
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>special_alphabet</code> list contains the special characters that I have in variables. I didn't display them because they're too long, but they're there.</p>
<p>The problem I'm having right now is that when I run this code and type in my input, it does actually check the 'name' (string) I've inserted, it just does it in order of the list(alphabet basically). So when I enter: <code>Amine</code>, it only returns the special character for A (because it's the first (0) in both the string and the list) and E (same reason, just it's fifth.)</p>
<p>What I'm looking for is how to make it go through the whole list without any order whatsoever and check all the items in it before running the <code>if</code> statement and printing out the special characters.
Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.maketrans" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.maketrans()</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.translate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.translate()</code></a> for these kinds of translation jobs:</p>
<pre><code>trans_tab = str.maketrans(dict(zip(alphabet, special_alphabet)))
name = input('Please insert your name: ')
translated_name = name.translate(trans_tab)
print(translated_name)
</code></pre>
<p>If you pass <code>str.maketrans()</code> a single dictionary argument that consists of strings of length 1 as keys and arbitrary length strings as values, it'll build you a translation table usable with <code>str.translate()</code>, which creates a new copy of the string where each character has been mapped through the given translation table.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>In [15]: trans = str.maketrans({
    ...:     'A': 'A ',
    ...:     'm': 'M ',
    ...:     'i': 'I ',
    ...:     'n': 'N ',
    ...:     'e': 'E '
    ...: })

In [16]: input("&gt; ").translate(trans)
&gt; Amine
Out[16]: 'A M I N E '
</code></pre>

<p>A <code>dictionary</code> of alphabet and spacial alphabet may be a best design</p>
<p>in your case try;</p>
<pre><code>for item in name:
    ind = alphabet.find(item)
    if ind != -1:
        print(special_alphabet[ind])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Try using a dict as lookup instead of 2 lists, where your regular alphabet is the key and special the value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IljaEverilä, yes I definitely didn't think of that, it could be better to organize code and all, but that doesn't really answer my problem... Thanks anyway</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you btw looking to only print the "translated" characters, as your example does, or the whole string, but translated? You might be able to replace this with just <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.maketrans" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.maketrans()</code></a> and <code>str.translate()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IljaEverilä I want it to print out the whole string. For example, if I type <code>Amine</code>, then I want it to print out the whole string in special characters (A M I N E, something like that). I don't understand really what you meant by mapping, sorry.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much!!! It worked!! I didn't know any these before, I'll definitely check them out later in details. Thanks!!!</span>
