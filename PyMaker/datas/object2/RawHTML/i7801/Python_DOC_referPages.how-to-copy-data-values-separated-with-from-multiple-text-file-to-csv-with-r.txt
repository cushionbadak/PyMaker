<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Trying to copy text next to variables like type, number, name from text file to csv with following form:</p>
<pre><code>Type      Name     Phone     email     Mailing Address
</code></pre>
<p>I Have lots of text file in this form:</p>
<pre><code>Type: zxyz
Number: 34567892
Name: xyzzzxx, yuw
Phone Number: 000-000-0000
Email Address: any@gmail.com
Mailing Address: bla bla bla
</code></pre>
<p>I am unable to copy text next to search string from text file and write it into csv file. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can convert the contents of one file to a dictionary like this:</p>
<pre><code>with open('file.txt') as f:
    d = dict(line.strip().split(': ') for line in f)
</code></pre>
<p>Then write the dictionary to a CSV file using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictWriter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv.DictWriter</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

fieldnames = ['Type', 'Name', 'Phone Number', 'Email Address', 'Mailing Address']
filenames = ['a.txt', 'b.txt', 'c.txt']

with open('out.csv', 'w') as outfile:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(outfile, fieldnames)
    writer.writerheader()
    for filename in filenames:
        with open(filename) as f:
            d = dict(line.strip().split(': ') for line in f)
            writer.writerow(d)
</code></pre>
<p>This will copy all of the data from the input files to a single CSV file. If you want to exclude some fields adjust the <code>fieldnames</code> and remove the unwanted fields from the dictionary prior to calling <code>writerow()</code>. You can also rename the fields by changing the field name in both <code>fieldnames</code> and the dictionary.</p>
