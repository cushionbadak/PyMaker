<p>I'm using the <code>SelectKBest()</code> class for feature selection in sklearn. <code>SelectKBest()</code> can take a callable score function as an input. In this case I would like to use <code>mutual_info_regression</code> as the score function. <code>mutual_info_regression</code> can take a few parameters which I would like to set myself. For example, I would like to set the <code>random_state = 0</code>. The problem is I'm not sure how to pass parameters into the score function since the score function is itself a parameter in <code>SelectKBest()</code>. Obviously something like <code>SelectKBest(score_func = mutual_info_classif(random_state=0))</code> won't work because the <code>mutal_info_classif</code> function would be called directly. I feel like this is probably a very basic question about python classes but I can't seem to find anything addressing what I'm looking for. Thanks in advance for your time! </p>

<p>You can create another function which calls mutual_info_regression and pass it instead:</p>
<pre><code>def my_score(X, y):
    return mutual_info_regression(X, y, random_state=0)

SelectKBest(score_func=my_score)
</code></pre>
<p>Python standard library provides an useful helper for creating such functions - it is called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">functools.partial</a>. It allows to create functions with some parameters pre-set; instead of "manual" my_score definition you can write</p>
<pre><code>from functools import partial
my_score = partial(mutual_info_regression, random_state=0)
SelectKBest(score_func=my_score)
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you can also pass <code>partial</code> directly, which gets you very close to your example:</p>
<pre><code>from functools import partial
SelectKBest(score_func=partial(mutual_info_classif, random_state=0))
</code></pre>
