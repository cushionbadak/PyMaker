<p>I'm trying to split a CSV file that has 201 rows. The first 136 rows contains information that is different from the remaining 65 rows. Is there anyway I can split the CSV file after 136 rows?</p>
<p>The solutions I have found so far split the file evenly. I have looked into this as a possible solution as well: <a href="https://gist.github.com/jrivero/1085501" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://gist.github.com/jrivero/1085501</a></p>

<p>You can use two <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv.reader</code></a> objects on your file object. <em>Slice</em> the first reader object up to the specified number of rows using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.islice</code></a>, and then read the rest of the rows using the second reader.</p>
<p>If the two parts are different by say delimiters, the two <code>csv.reader</code> objects can easily handle this:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
from itertools import islice

with open('your_file_name.csv') as f:
    first_rows = list(islice(csv.reader(f), None, 136))
    last_rows = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=';')) # use a different delim or quote char
</code></pre>

<p>If you know the number of lines you need to skip you can use <code>csvreader.line_num</code> to know the line you're reading, you can find more info about it here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#reader-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#reader-objects</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Read them in and then take two slices <code>rows[:136]</code> and <code>rows[136:]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the solution! Would the approach be the same if I was using pandas and its read csv function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wolverinejohn You can slice the file iterator directly and pass the slice to the csv read function of pandas.</span>
