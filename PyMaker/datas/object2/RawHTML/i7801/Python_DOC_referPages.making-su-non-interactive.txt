<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was in need of a script to perform certain actions remotely using python and paramiko. I performed sudo operations in remote machine using </p>
<blockquote>
<p>'echo '+password+' | sudo -S '+'cmd_to_be_executed'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and tty issue was solved by setting the flag get_pty as true in paramiko. Now there is a remote machine which does not have sudo permission for that user, <strong>only way to switch to root is by using su command</strong>. So I tried</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'echo '+password+' | su -c '+'cmd_to_be_executed'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but it throws tty issue. Now even if I, set pty flag as true in paramiko the same issue appears</p>
<blockquote>
<p>standard in must be a tty</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there any way to solve this ? Any help is much appreciated thanks!!!</p>

<p>Yes. You can use a Python command script achieve this.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">argparse</a> to accept command line arguments, which will be your password.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess.run</a> to call your script. You may need to use the shell=True with subprocess. (Or use <a href="http://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pexpect</a> instead of subprocess).</p>
<p>Try something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess, argparse

#Set up the command line arguments

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Provide root password.')
parser.add_argument('--password', help='password help')

# Collect the arguments from the command line
args = parser.parse_args()

# Open a pipe to the command you want to run
p = subprocess.Popen(['su', '-c', !!your command here!!],stdout=subprocess.PIPE,stdin=subprocess.PIPE)

# Prepare the password and write it
pwd = args.password + '\n'
p.stdin.write(pwd)
p.communicate()[0]
p.stdin.close()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>popen()</code> cannot handle commands like <code>ssh</code>/<code>su</code> which read passwords from tty. that's why we have <code>expect</code>/<code>pexpect</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The same error persists moreover I should use ssh to connect to the remote machine at first</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you would need to have the python script running on the remote machine after you ssh onto it (take a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4180390/execute-remote-python-script-via-ssh" title="execute remote python script via ssh">stackoverflow.com/questions/4180390/â€¦</a>)</span>
