<p>I have the following string which is a list of lists:</p>
<pre><code>"ID":[[310.5,1.1612828],[310.0,15.0],[310.0,2.9755309],[309.5,30.0]]
</code></pre>
<p>I want to grab all the first values of each list into a <code>variable</code>, so the output should be in this case</p>
<pre><code>print variable
</code></pre>
<p>expected output:</p>
<pre><code>310.5
310.0
310.0
309.5
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To capture the first elements into a variable, you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a> like:</p>
<h3>Code:</h3>
<pre><code>data = {
    'ID': [[310.5, 1.1612828],
           [310.0, 15.0],
           [310.0, 2.9755309],
           [309.5, 30.0]]
}

variable = [x[0] for x in data['ID']]

print(variable)
</code></pre>
<h3>Results:</h3>
<pre><code>[310.5, 310.0, 310.0, 309.5]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>id = [[310.5,1.1612828],[310.0,15.0],[310.0,2.9755309],[309.5,30.0]]

# If you just want to output to console:
[print(x[0]) for x in id]  #if id a list
# if id is in dict named dict_
[print(x[0] for x in dict_['id']
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a longer version.</p>
<pre><code>dict_ = {'id': [[310.5,1.1612828],
                [310.0,15.0],
                [310.0,2.9755309],
                [309.5,30.0]]
                }



#make a list containing position 0 values of sublists
pos_0 = [x[0] for x in dict_['id']]
print(pos_0)

#output them to a file
for entry in pos_0:
      print(entry)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This code will iterate over every first element and append it to the out list for ease of access in the future. </p>
<pre><code>dict_ = {"ID":[[310.5,1.1612828],[310.0,15.0],[310.0,2.9755309],[309.5,30.0]]}
out=[]

for item in dict_["ID"]:
    out.append(item[0])
print(out)

<p>This will output <code>[310.5, 310.0, 310.0, 309.5]</code>. Is this what you needed?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I really like this answer but it doesn't work in my scenario..I neglected to say this lists of lists is nested inside a dictionary like this {a="timestamp":1496485492,"ID":[[310.5,1.1612828],[310.0,15.‌​0],[310.0,2.9755309]‌​,[309.5,30.0]]} can you help?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The answer supplied fits that scenario exactly.  Just change <code>data</code> to match the name of your dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the above but this seems to give me a print out of [[310.5,1.1612828],[310.0,15.0],[310.0,2.9755309],[309.5,30.0]] with the second element still present..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is the ID a dictionary in your code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While you <i>could</i> do this, it's not idiomatic to use a list comprehension only for its side effects. The better way is to split this into to separate steps. First create the list, then print it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know I was just showing it as a proof of concept for how to do it. Below is a more verbose edition.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">could this be because the list of lists is nested inside a dictionary? so the full "list"looks like this {a="timestamp":1496485492,"ID":[[310.5,1.1612828],[310.0,15.0],[310.0,2.9755309],[309.5,30.0]]}</span>
