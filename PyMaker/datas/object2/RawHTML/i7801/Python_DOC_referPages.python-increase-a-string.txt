<p>I am not really familiar with Python yet.
I have a string like <code>"11223300"</code>. Now I want to increase the last byte of that string ( from <code>"00"</code> to <code>"FF"</code>). I tried to convert the string into an integer ( <code>integer=int(string,16)</code>) and increase it, and convert it back later, but that does not work for me. Maybe one of you guys has a better idea.</p>
<pre><code>string = "11223300"
counter = int(string, 16)

for i in range(255): 
    counter = counter + 1
    IV = hex(counter)
</code></pre>
<p>Now I want to convert the <code>IV</code> from hex into a string</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You can use <code>format</code> to convert <code>int</code> to your hex string, which will not keep the <code>0x</code> prefix:</p>
<pre><code>string = "11223300"
counter = int(string, 16)

for i in range(255): 
    counter = counter + 1
    IV = format(counter, 'X')
print(IV)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>112233FF
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So are you literally wanting to change the last two bits of the string to "FF"? If so, easy</p>
<pre><code>string = "11223300"
modified_string = string[:-2] + "FF"
</code></pre>
<p><b>Edit from comments</b></p>
<pre><code>hex_str = "0x11223300"
for i in range(256):
    hex_int = int(hex_str, 16)
    new_int = hex_int + 0x01
    print(hex(hex_int))
    hex_str = str(hex(new_int))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why doesn't it work? Do you want a hex string back? In which case, look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hex" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>hex()</code></a> function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please include the code you have in the question, and perhaps someone could help you with it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"integer=int(string,16)) and increase it, and convert it back later, but that does not work for me." Add your code and the error you get to your question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The code you added works exactly as expected. After the last iteration <code>IV</code> is <code>'0x112233ff'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>IV</code> is already a string. To remove the <code>0x</code> prefix simply do <code>IV = IV[2:]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh great! Thanks, that works for me !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ohh sorry my fault. No I want to count the last byte from 00,01,02.... to FF.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you please include an example of the output that you want to achieve?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">11223300; 11223301; 11223302; 11223303 .........112233FE; 112233FF</span>
