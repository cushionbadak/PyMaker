<p>I have devices.txt file that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>tw004:Galaxy S5:Samsung:Mobilni telefon:5
tw002:Galaxy S6:Samsung:Mobilni telefon:1
tw001:Huawei P8:Huawei:Mobilni telefon:4
tw003:Huawei P9:Huawei:Mobilni telefon:3
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I have code like this, and I have to chose how to sort devices in table (for example sort them by code from tw001 to tw004 or sort them by producer's name from A to Z)</p>
<pre><code>def formatheader():
        print(
    "Code |    Name    |  Producer  |       Description       |  Quantity   |\n"
    "-----+------------+------------+-------------------------+-------------|")

def sortbycode():
    devices = open('devices.txt', 'r')
    formatheader()
    for i in devices:
        devices = i.strip("\n").split(":")
        print("{0:5}|{1:13}|{2:15}|{3:18}|{4:5}".format(    
            devices[0],
            devices[1],
            devices[2],
            devices[3],
            devices[4]))
    print()
</code></pre>
<p>How to do that?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try this.</p>
<pre><code>def formatheader():
        print(
    "Code |    Name     |   Producer    |     Description  |  Quantity   |\n"
    "-----+-------------+---------------+------------------+-------------|")

def sortbycode():
    device_file = open('devices.txt', 'r')
    formatheader()
    devices = []
    for line in device_file:
        devices.append([i  for i in line.strip("\n").split(":")])
    devices.sort(key=lambda x:x[0])
    for device in devices:
      print("{0:5}|{1:13}|{2:15}|{3:18}|{4:5}".format(*device))
sortbycode()

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.sort</code></a> method of lists:</p>
<pre><code>devices.sort()
# or if you want to sort by another field, use a key function
devices.sort(key=lambda x:int(x[4])) # sort by integer value of quantity
</code></pre>
<p>You should use a different variable name in the <code>for</code> loop to avoid messing with <code>devices</code>. And, if you want to sort by another column, you will need to do the splitting each line of <code>devices</code> into a list before you loop over and print them. You may need two loops (the original for loop to print, and a while loop to process each line ready to sort)</p>
<p>Side note: for this use case, using <code>.strip()</code> without any arguments would be safer, as that will catch leading/trailing whitespace, as well as removing <code>'\r\n'</code> style line endings (if the file so happens to have them).</p>
<p>Also, since you know the list for each row will always be the same format, you could use <code>.format(*devices)</code> to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">unpack the list to arguments</a>, which may be shorter or neater.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you simply read all strings into a list of strings and call <code>sorted()</code> (with no keys, splitting, etc.), you'll have the list sorted by devices.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yep that will do the job</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually I have to choose what will be the key for sorting, code, name or producer. So if I choose to sort by Producer name from A to Z, then it will print me devices in table regadles of device's code. I just thought if I figure out how to sort by code, I also understand how to sort by other parameters. :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank's a lot. You saved me. That's exatcly what I looking for. That is concretely answer.</span>
