<p>I am trying to split a list of 24 objects coming from grasshopper3d,
[poly-lines1][poly-lines2]....[poly-lines24] into 4 parts, so each 6 lists of poly-lines could be appended to different and separate lists- each 6 objects represents faces for a box, so each box which is a seperate list [] has 6 elements in it-, i have been trying to use the itertools library to do that but i am kind of having a problem with function.
i was trying to split the list as well.</p>
<pre><code>def split(polyLines,list_i,n):
    list_i.append(polyLines[0:len(polyLines):n])
    print list_i
    return list_i


lists_of_rocks = int(len(polyLines)/6)

for i in range(0,lists_of_rocks):
    list_i = []
    print list_i

    #split(polyLines,list_i,n)
    islice(polyLines,6)

def islice(polyLines,6):
    # islice('ABCDEFG', 2) --&gt; A B
    # islice('ABCDEFG', 2, 4) --&gt; C D
    # islice('ABCDEFG', 2, None) --&gt; C D E F G
    # islice('ABCDEFG', 0, None, 2) --&gt; A C E G
    s = slice(6)
    it = iter(xrange(s.start or 0, s.stop or sys.maxint, s.step or 1))
    nexti = next(it)
    for i, element in enumerate(polyLines):
        if i == nexti:
            yield element
            nexti = next(it)

<p>I am answering <em>that</em> question. I have no idea how anything else you wrote matters to the question, so if I misunderstood you I will delete my answer.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = range(24)
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = [l[i:i+6] for i in range(0, len(l), 6)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for x in result: x
... 
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]
</code></pre>
<p><code>l</code> is your list of 24 arbitrary objects.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">can you add your input and your desired output ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm betting that the OP is trying to say that she have a list of lists with a length equal to 24. And she is trying to split them by range of 6 elements and merge the elements into new lists.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChihebNexus hopefully OP leaves a comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You mean the comments within the code ? These comments and the the method <code>islice()</code> was copy/paste from the official documentation within its comments. Take a looke <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChihebNexus sorry for not being clear with my question, the output of lists that you write in your comment is exactly what im looking for  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] where each list takes 6 elements or sub-lists  however could you please elaborate more on this line of the code?   -for x in result: x-</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RashaAlshami: This part <code>for x in result: x</code> will run under <code>Python's interpreter</code>. If you're using an IDE or a text editor, use <code>for x in result: print(x)</code>.</span>
