<p>is there a way to import multiple python files into a main python file?</p>
<p>I have a bunch of py files and each one has to run in the main python file and the data are saved into a json file. </p>
<p>This is what I tried and it gave me an error.</p>
<pre><code>import light.py as light 
</code></pre>
<p>Error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
File "&lt;frozen importlib._bootstrap&gt;", line 2218, in  _find_and_load_unlocked
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute '__path__'

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/home/pi/Desktop/majorproject/pillar1.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
import sensorkey.py as sensorkey
ImportError: No module named 'sensorkey.py'; 'sensorkey' is not a package
</code></pre>
<p>I have also tried specifying the path to the py file and it didn't work either and keeps giving an invalid syntax error. </p>
<pre><code>import /home/pi/Desktop/json/light.py as light
</code></pre>
<p>Update: 
I managed to fix the import error but i now, after importing this light.py file, i have to print out certain keys from a dictionary (key) into this new file then export it to a json file. I'm currently using TinyDB to do so. Here are my codes: </p>
<pre><code>from tinydb import TinyDB, Query
import json
from light import key

with open("/home/pi/Desktop/json/sensortestest.json", 'w+'):
    db = TinyDB('/home/pi/Desktop/json/sensortestest.json')
    table = db.table('Light')
    db.insert_multiple([{'Key 1' :key[lightkey]}, {'Key 2' : key[lightkeyID]}])
</code></pre>
<p>Error: </p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/pi/Desktop/majorproject/testertestest.py", line 12, in &lt;module&gt;
    db.insert_multiple([{'Key 1' :key[lightkey]}, {'Key 2' : key[lightkeyID]}])
</code></pre>
<p>NameError: name 'lightkey' is not defined</p>
<p>The problem is I had already defined 'lightkey'  in its own file already.  </p>

<p>To include the dictionary, you could do this if your file location is in different directory (with caution of path.append as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44491453/2306662">@Coldspeed mentioned</a>):</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append("path/foo/bar/")
from light import *
</code></pre>
<p>If it is in same directory as current directory, you could just do:</p>
<pre><code>from light import *
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The syntax for importing <code>your_filename.py</code>, assuming it is in the same directory, is </p>
<pre><code>import your_filename
</code></pre>
<p>In your case, it would be</p>
<pre><code>import light
</code></pre>
<p>Note the absence of <code>.py</code>.</p>
<p>If your file is in a different directory, you'll need to do:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append('path/to/dir/containing/your_filename.py')
import your_filename
</code></pre>
<p>Note that appending to <code>sys.path</code> is dangerous, and should not be done unless you know what you're doing.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Try <code>from ...json import light</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It sounds like you need to read about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#modules" rel="nofollow noreferrer">modules</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages" rel="nofollow noreferrer">packages</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am trying to import a .py file into another. I've tried import light.py as light but it didnt work because of the .py extension. so i removed it but it gave me another error that a dict is not defined but i defined it in its own file already</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your errors is not related to <code>light.py</code> importing because if your file couldn't be imported your error will be <code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'light'</code> but yours is different</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you so much! it runs! By the way, if i just do '' from light import * ''  , it runs everything that the light file is supposed to print right? If i just want to print out a certain key and not running the  whole script, what should i do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hi thanks for the reply. I tried that but it's giving me another error. I will update it above</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanielWinser The syntax is <code>import sensorkey</code>, or <code>import light</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I managed to solve the problem. turns out, i just had to do a "from light import  * " because the file is in the same directory. But now, the thing is that i wan to print out certain keys from this light file and not all of it becuase right now, * runs the whole script and prints out all the keys. How to i specify what to print without printing all the keys in the light file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanielWinser from light import v1, v2, ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry, i meant a dictionary. i tried to import a dictionary from the file but it said that the dictionary is not defined. Let me update the question yeah? Thanks for the help!! you're a lifesaver!</span>
