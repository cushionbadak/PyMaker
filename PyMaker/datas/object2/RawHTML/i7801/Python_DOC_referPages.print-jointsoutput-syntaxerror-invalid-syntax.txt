<p>is it due to syntax are different in python 2.x and 3.x versions? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm going to go out on a limb and say you must be using python 3. In that case, this must be written as <code>print("".join(tsOutput))</code></p>
<p>This is because <code>print</code> is a function in python 3, and needs standard function syntax. (In python 2 it was built more tightly into the core language and was an exception to the regular syntax in that it required no parentheses)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should add parenthesis to your print statement</p>
<p><code>print("".join(tsOutput))</code> should work</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>print("".join(tsOutput))</code> try this.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Which version of python, 2.7 or 3-x?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If this is python 3, the error is that <code>print</code> is a function and needs parentheses. I don't off the top of my head see how this would be a syntax error in python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have tags for python-2.7 and python-3.x. Since the syntax for <code>print</code> is different in each version, you can't use this line in both.</span>
