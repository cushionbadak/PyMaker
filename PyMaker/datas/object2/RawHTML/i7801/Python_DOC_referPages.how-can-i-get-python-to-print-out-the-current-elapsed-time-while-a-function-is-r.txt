<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I currently have python printing how long it took for a function to run after its done running with something like:</p>
<pre><code>import time
t = time.time()
# do something in here
print "\n Time Taken: %.3f sec" % (time.time()-t)
</code></pre>
<p>but I want to show the live time that has passed since the function has started, and I cant quite figure out a way to get that to happen.</p>
<p>for example in a terminal I want it to say something like:</p>
<pre><code>Working on xFunction. Time Elapsed 72.485 sec... (live updated time)
xFunction Has finished.
Time Taken: 1152.546 sec
</code></pre>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Here's an example with a thread that will print how much time has elapsed since it started and can be stopped from the main loop.</p>
<pre><code>import time
import threading

class ElapsedTimeThread(threading.Thread):
    """"Stoppable thread that prints the time elapsed"""
    def __init__(self):
        super(ElapsedTimeThread, self).__init__()
        self._stop_event = threading.Event()

    def stop(self):
        self._stop_event.set()

    def stopped(self):
        return self._stop_event.is_set()

    def run(self):
        thread_start = time.time()
        while not self.stopped():
            print("\rElapsed Time {:.3f} seconds".format(time.time()-thread_start), end="")
            #include a delay here so the thread doesn't uselessly thrash the CPU
            time.sleep(0.01)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start = time.time()
    thread = ElapsedTimeThread()
    thread.start()
    # do something
    time.sleep(5)
    # something is finished so stop the thread
    thread.stop()
    thread.join()
    print() # empty print() to output a newline
    print("Finished in {:.3f} seconds".format(time.time()-start))
</code></pre>
<p>This gives the following output, with the <em>Elapsed Time</em> counting up from zero and being overwritten:</p>
<pre><code>J:\&gt;python thr_time.py
Elapsed Time 5.000 seconds
Finished in 5.001 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>Let me know if you'd like clarification on any portions.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can start a new thread for it with <code>os.fork()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that OP seems to want a <i>live</i> display of elapsed time (as title already suggests, but question text doesn't).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>threading</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why don't you put that printout in between whatever statements that function has?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please show a function and how you plan to call it.</span>
