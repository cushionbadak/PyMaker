<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to get the different required combinations out from dataframe column with few rows.It is something like below:
I have following values in one of the columns of my df</p>
<pre><code>Oy
On
G1
G2
A1
A2
A3
A4
R1
R2
R3
L1
L2
A5
A6
</code></pre>
<p>Here oy,on belong to group 1,</p>
<pre><code>G1,g2 - group 2,
A1 to a4 - group 3,
R1 to r3 - group 4,
L1,l2 - group 5,
A5,a6 - group 6
</code></pre>
<p>Now I am trying all the combinations from each value of the each group ranging from 1 value to all like below:</p>
<pre><code>Oy
Oy g1
Oy g1 a1
Oy g1 a1 r1
Oy g1 a1 r1 l1 
Oy g1 a1 r1 l1 a5
</code></pre>
<p>This will be for all possible combinations.note that within group combination is not desirable like g1 and g2 cannot come in same combination.</p>
<p>I know that this is possible with for loops with some if conditions.But looking for more efficient and elegant solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you may want to <code>itertools.product</code> on the various groupings. 
To get the groups you could do </p>
<pre><code>first_letter = df[col].str[0].str.lower()
groups = df[col].groupby(first_letter).unique()
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>col</code> here is the name of the column describe above). </p>
<p>This gives a mapping from the first letter (lowercase) to an array of the unique values starting with that letter (lower or upper case). Then you can do <code>itertools.product(*groups)</code> to get all six-tuples containing one member from each group. 
To get all combinations of, say, the g and o groups, you can do <code>itertools.product(*groups[['g', 'o']])</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Joe,I am not clear on how are you handling groups above.As per what I said ,I have 6 groups here and I need all possible combinations...could you please elaborate considering all 6 groups...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I meant "six-tuples", not "five-tuples". Have you tried the code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am trying it...will update...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Got it Joe.Thanks</span>
