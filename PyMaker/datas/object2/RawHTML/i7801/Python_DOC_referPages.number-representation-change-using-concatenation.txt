<p>There are many questions asking about how to concatenate a string and an integer for example <code>4</code> and <code>"Blue"</code> to <code>4Blue</code>. This can be done by casting the integer as a string <code>str(4)</code> and adding it with <code>"Blue"</code> (<code>str(4) + "Blue"</code>).</p>
<p><em>I am trying to convert a number to its three-digit equivalent (Or bearing form). For example, 40 would become 040.</em></p>
<p>I have quickly put together this code:</p>
<pre><code>number=90
newn = number

one="0"
two="00"
num=str(number)
length=len(num)

if length == 1:
    newn = two + num
elif length == 2:
    newn = one + num
elif length == 3:
    pass

print(newn)
</code></pre>
<p>Which outputs this, as expected:</p>
<pre><code>090
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>I was wondering what the simplest way of doing this would be, along with if this is a good method of achieving this.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The following will do:</p>
<pre><code>print('{:03}'.format(90))
</code></pre>
<p>You can change the number <code>3</code> depending on how many leading zeros you want to have.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use</p>
<pre><code>s = str(num).zfill(3)
print(s)
</code></pre>
<p><code>3</code> means leading zeros count.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@AChampion Thank you very much, these will be very useful for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Starting with Python 3.6 you can use an "f_string" (aka <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#formatted-string-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>Formatted string literal</i></a>) which means all you need is a <code>print(f'{length:03}')</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am still very new to python. May I ask exactly how the <code>:03</code> is used for the format? (This is very badly worded, I apologise.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Cheesecake You should read the official docs that  AChampion has linked for you.</span>
