<p>I am trying to have two environments in anaconda, one with python 3.4 and one with python 2.7. I already had everything working for python 3.4 and created a new environment with:</p>
<pre><code>conda create -n python2 python=2.7 anaconda
</code></pre>
<p>and i activated this with:</p>
<pre><code>activate python2
</code></pre>
<p>When i then run python, it still uses packages from C:\anaconda3\lib. Here are the standard packages for python 3.4 located (I think). This will give errors when using python 2.7. How can i make sure the python 2.7 environment uses al standard packages for python 2.7?</p>
<p>I tried manually copying the files to C:\Anaconda3\envs\python2\lib, but without success.</p>

<p>From: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Using Python in Windows</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have multiple versions of Python installed (e.g., 2.7 and 3.6)
  you will have noticed that Python 3.6 was started - to launch Python
  2.7, try the command:
  <code>py -2.7</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the launcher is run with no explicit Python version specification, and a virtual environment (created with the standard library venv module or the external virtualenv tool) active, the launcher will run the virtual environmentâ€™s interpreter rather than the global one. To run the global interpreter, either deactivate the virtual environment, or explicitly specify the global Python version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I think solution for you is create isolated environment using virtualenv with specific python version:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install pip <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">instructions are detailed here</a></li>
<li><code>pip install virtualenv</code></li>
<li><code>virtualenv venv</code>
<ul>
<li>(venv is virtual environment name)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>\path\to\env\Scripts\activate</code>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">For better instructions</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Validate your python version by python -V<br/>
If version is 3.4, start your anaconda.</p>

<p>I found why it was not working. I was using Spyder, which sets the environment variable PYTHONPATH to C:\anaconda3\lib.</p>
<p>I removed the variable with </p>
<pre><code>set PYTHONPATH=
</code></pre>
<p>in cmd and now it works. The only thing left is that i have to do this every time and i suspect this to be because Spyder changes it back.  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Which packages are you needing/using that are giving errors?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not sure if it is a package or a part of a package, but re.py for regular expressions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">version 2.2.1   [Comment character length is too low]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's part of the standard library. What error are you getting when you try to import/use <code>re</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please answer the questions: 1) After you activate the environment <code>activate python2</code> and start the interpreter by typing <code>python</code>, what version is shown? 2) If the correct version (Python 2.7.x) is printed, what error do you get when you try to use <code>re</code> because it's not clear what the problem is.</span>
