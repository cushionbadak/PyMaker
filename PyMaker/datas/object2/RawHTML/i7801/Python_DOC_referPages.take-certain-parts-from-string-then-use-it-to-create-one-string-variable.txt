<p>I'm trying to create a variable that's a string from a list
The list is just the alphabet (Don't ask why, it just has to for the program)</p>
<pre><code>passwords = ["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z"]
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, I used to have a variable that took 4 random letters from it to create one string that looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>correctPassword = random.sample(passwords,4)
</code></pre>
<p>What I need is 4 specific characters from the list to create the same kind of string variable, the word "STOP".</p>
<p>An answer to this would be greatly appreciated, I'm trying to recreate the hacking minigame from Fallout, if any of you know what that is, thanks!</p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do, but...
To create a string variable equal to "STOP":</p>
<pre><code>x = "STOP"
</code></pre>
<p>The line of code </p>
<pre><code>correctPassword = random.sample(passwords,4)
</code></pre>
<p>doesn't create a string variable but a list of strings 4 items long, each item being a 1-character string.  Using x as defined above, the expression <code>x == correctPassword</code> will always be false.</p>
<p>To consolidate those into a single string:</p>
<pre><code>correctPasswordAsString = ''.join(correctPassword)
</code></pre>
<p>A comparison <code>x == correctPasswordAsString</code> will be true if correctPasswordAsString is "STOP", false otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can just create the variable as the following:</p>
<p><code>correctPassword = ["S", "T", "O", "P"]</code></p>
<p>Or, you can use the indexes of the letters:</p>
<p><code>correctPassword = [passwords[18], passwords[19], passwords[14], passwords[15]]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use this for create a string variable from list:</p>
<pre><code>import random
passwords = ["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z"]
correctPassword = random.sample(passwords,4)
result = ""
result = result.join(correctPassword)
print(result)
</code></pre>
<p>and get something like:<code>STOP</code></p>
<p>The Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer">join()</a> method is a string method. It merges a list of objects into a string.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please show what you have tried so far to solve this. Explain using your code what issues you are facing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you try and word it a little clearer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since the letters are in order, cant you just use an index for the indexes of s,t,o,p?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please tell me you didn't type out passwords and did <code>passwords = list(string.ascii_uppercase)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">he is not using passwords for security purposes, i think he is using this as a check to see if a player enters  predetermined password.</span>
