<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text string and I want to replace two words with a single word. E.g. if the word is <code>artificial intelligence</code>, I want to replace it with <code>artificial_intelligence</code>. This needs to be done for a list of 200 words and on a text file of size 5 mb.
I tried <code>string.replace</code> but it can work only for one element, not for the list.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text='Artificial intelligence is useful for us in every situation of deep learning.'</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>List a : list b
Artificial intelligence: artificial_intelligence
Deep learning: deep_ learning 
...
</code></pre>
<p><code>Text.replace('Artificial intelligence','Artificial_intelligence'</code>) is working.
But</p>
<pre><code>For I in range(len(Lista)):
 Text=Text.replace(Lista[I],List b[I])
</code></pre>
<p>doesn't work.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would suggest using a <code>dict</code> for your replacements:</p>
<pre><code>text = "Artificial intelligence is useful for us in every situation of deep learning."
replacements = {"Artificial intelligence" : "Artificial_intelligence",
                "deep learning" : "deep_learning"}
</code></pre>
<p>Then your approach works (although it is case-sensitive):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for rep in replacements:
        text = text.replace(rep, replacements[rep])
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(text)
Artificial_intelligence is useful for us in every situation of deep_learning.
</code></pre>
<p>For other approaches (like the suggested regex-approach), have a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6116978/python-replace-multiple-strings">SO: Python replace multiple strings</a>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since you have a case problem between your list entries and your string, you could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.sub()</code></a> function with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.IGNORECASE" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>IGNORECASE</code></a> flag to obtain what you want:</p>
<pre><code>import re

list_a = ['Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning']
list_b = ['artificial_intelligence', 'deep_learning']
text = 'Artificial intelligence is useful for us in every situation of deep learning.'

for from_, to in zip(list_a, list_b):
    text = re.sub(from_, to, text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)

print(text)
#Â artificial_intelligence is useful for us in every situation of deep_learning.
</code></pre>
<p>Note the use of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=zip#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip()</code></a> function wich allows to iterate over the two lists in the same time.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Also note that Christian is right, a dict would be more suitable for your substitution data. The previous code would then be the following for the exact same result:</p>
<pre><code>import re

subs = {'Artificial intelligence': 'artificial_intelligence',
        'Deep learning': 'deep_learning'}
text = 'Artificial intelligence is useful for us in every situation of deep learning.'

for from_, to in subs.items():
    text = re.sub(from_, to, text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)

print(text)

<span class="comment-copy">200 words doesn't look much, have you tried use Sublime Text and do a simple find / replace?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually I am having 98 such files..it will be too long to manually update all:)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, but this is just a 'one time' replace? If so, I still recommend you to use sublime text and do a Ctrl + Shift + F and replace all occurrences.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AartikaSethi why not using regex  for searching that word and then replace it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is actually not working? do you get an error message? is the result erroneous?</span>
