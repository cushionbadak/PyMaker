<p>I have a question regarding the text.count() function in python.
Suppose I have the following text and I want to return the number of occurrences of "CCC":</p>
<pre><code>text = "ACCCGTTGCCCC"
print text.count("CCC")
</code></pre>
<p>why it returns 2 and not 3?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>According to the documentation of the <code>str.count</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(str.count)
Help on method_descriptor:

count(...)
    S.count(sub[, start[, end]]) -&gt; int

    Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in
    string S[start:end].  Optional arguments start and end are interpreted
    as in slice notation.
</code></pre>
<p>So in your case there are two non-overlapping occurences of <code>CCC</code> in the string <code>"ACCCGTTGCCCC"</code>.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>Text.count() 
</code></pre>
<p>returns the number of occurrences of the substring sub.
In this case: "A<strong>CCC</strong>GTTG<strong>CCCC</strong>" 
Gives you 2 because your substring is "CCC" collectively which occurs only twice in the string.(i.e. where "C" is placed next to each other at least 3 times.) </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Best would be to use the already available <code>Counter</code>.</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

c = Counter('test')
print (c)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Counter({'t': 2, 'e': 1, 's': 1})
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks, in case of overlapping string should I have to implement my own function or there are some built-in one?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@simalps you can use the Counter from collections, it will output a frequency dictionary</span>
