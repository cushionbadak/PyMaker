<p>I am creating test cases on menu that may be same across all web pages. </p>
<p>So I want to reuse the test cases for different urls. I don't want to create a new test case for every url. It will make a test suite cumbersome. </p>
<p>I am using automated tests with Python's unittest and Selenium. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using a parameter for the URL.
Maybe using environment parameters:

<p>or something else depending on your test framework</p>
