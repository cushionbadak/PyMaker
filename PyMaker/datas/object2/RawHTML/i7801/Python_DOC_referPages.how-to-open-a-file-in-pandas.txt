<p>Having difficulty opening a csv file in pandas, I have tried:</p>
<pre><code>data = pd.read_csv("/home/me/Programming/data/sample.csv")
</code></pre>
<p>That did not work, so I tried:</p>
<pre><code>import os
cwd = os.getcwd()

data = pd.read_csv(cwd + "sample.csv")
</code></pre>
<p>and that doesn't work either, just says that file does not exist, but it's there in the file manager clear as day.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>os.getcwd()</code> return the current working directory without trailing path separtor.</p>
<p>You should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.path.join</code></a> instead of <code>+</code> to correctly join paths:</p>
<pre><code>import os

cwd = os.getcwd()
data = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(cwd, 'sample.csv'))
</code></pre>
<p>BTW, there's no need to specify full path of current working directory; just specify <code>sample.csv</code> should be enough:</p>
<pre><code>data = pd.read_csv("sample.csv")
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure the file <code>sample.csv</code> is in the current working directory.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>pd.read_csv('/path/to/file.csv')</code> will work if <code>f = open('/path/to/file.csv')</code> works. So make sure you can open your file using <code>open()</code> function...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I thought as much and as it were, I was in the wrong directory when trying to prototype the line in the python shell. I didn't know the os.path.join, and I think I need to.</span>
