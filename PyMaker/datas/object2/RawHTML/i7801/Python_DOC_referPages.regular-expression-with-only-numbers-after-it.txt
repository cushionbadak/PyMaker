<p>I'm fairly new to using regular expressions in general. And I'm having trouble coming up with one that will suit my purpose.</p>
<p>I've tried this</p>
<pre><code>line1 = 'REQ-1234'
match = re.match(r'^REQ-\d', line1, re.I)
</code></pre>
<p>This will work as long as the string is not something like
'REQ-1234 and then there is more stuff'</p>
<p>Is there a way to specify that there must not be anything after 'REQ-' except numbers? The other requirement is that 'REQ-1234' must be the only thing in the string. I think the caret symbol takes care of that though.</p>

<p>You need to add a <code>+</code> quantifier after <code>\d</code> to match 1 or more digits, and then add <code>$</code> anchor to require the end of string position after these digits:</p>
<pre><code>match = re.match(r'REQ-\d+$', line1, re.I)
                         ^^   
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>^</code> is redundant since you are using <code>re.match</code> that anchors the match at the string start.</p>
<p>To match a <code>req-</code> that <em>may</em> be followed with digits, replace <code>+</code> (1 or more repetitions) with <code>*</code> quantifier (0 or more repetitions).</p>
<p>Note that with Python 3, you may use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.fullmatch" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.fullmatch</code></a> without explicit anchors, <code>r'REQ-\d+'</code> or <code>r'REQ-\d*'</code> will do.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Add a closing anchor and quantify the <code>\d</code>. <code>^REQ-\d+$</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>re.match()</code> matches any string starting with you pattern, this is why you have to add closing anchor <code>$</code> at the end. Alternatively, you  can use <code>re.fullmatch()</code>.</span>
