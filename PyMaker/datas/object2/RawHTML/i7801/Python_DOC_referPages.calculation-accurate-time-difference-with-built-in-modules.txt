<pre><code>start = time.clock()
print("test ")
time.sleep(1)
print(time.clock()-start)
</code></pre>
<p>The final line prints the result normally but sometimes it gives a result less than 1 (0.9962501944182808 or 0.9886929485969909 etc.)</p>
<p>If I have made the code sleep for 1 second with <code>time.sleep(1)</code> I would have thought that the result would always greater than 1.</p>
<p>It is not precise so how can I calculate time consumed by my code with built-in modules?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any
  caught signal will terminate the sleep() following execution of that
  signal’s catching routine. Also, the suspension time may be longer
  than requested by an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of
  other activity in the system.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">time.sleep() is not that precise (and it cannot be on any non-RT OS anyway). As the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time.sleep()</code></a> documentation states: <code>The actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any caught signal will terminate the sleep() following execution of that signal’s catching routine. Also, the suspension time may be longer than requested by an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of other activity in the system.</code></span>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm guessing this is Windows? (Microsoft's implementation <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/15967564/14122">favors slightly shorter sleeps</a>).</span>
