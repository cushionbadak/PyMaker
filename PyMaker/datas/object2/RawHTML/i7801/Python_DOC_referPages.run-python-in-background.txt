<p>I've been searching a lot for this problem, but I didnt find any valuable answer.</p>
<p>I want to make a script (lets say it is a library) which runs some functions at reboot. Inside my library, there will be a function like </p>
<pre><code>def randomfunction():
    print("randomtext")
</code></pre>
<p>After loading this function, everytime a call for randomfunction() in any python run (I will .py as cgi scripts) will return me "randomtext".</p>
<p>Is that possible or I miss something?</p>
<hr/>
<p>It is working on python idle if I use exec, but I want this exec to be on system. That would be for a linux OS.</p>

<p>Don't you need some kind of Interprocess Communication for this?</p>
<p>Might be worth taking a look at these docs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python IPC</a></p>
<p>Also, 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4761617/python-remote-procedure-call-without-the-remote-part">this SO post</a> might help you. I think it offers a solution to what you are looking for.</p>
