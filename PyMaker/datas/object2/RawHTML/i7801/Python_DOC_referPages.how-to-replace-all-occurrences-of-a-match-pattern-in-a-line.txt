<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Suppose I have a line like:</p>
<pre><code>"[foo] and (foo) along with foofrancis.foo = foo"
</code></pre>
<p>Where the match pattern <code>"foo"</code> is always contiguous to non <code>a-zA-Z</code> characters but may occur any number of times in a line. </p>
<p>I want to replace all occurrences of <code>"foo"</code> with <code>"bar"</code> when foo is not contiguous to an a-z or A-Z character and output a newline.</p>
<p>Where <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code> are both variables I am passing in. Sort of like:</p>
<pre><code> foo = "Hello"
 bar = "Goodbye"
 line = "[Hello] and (Hello) along with Hellofrancis.Hello = Hello"
 newline = re.sub(&lt;Unsure what goes here&gt;,line)
 print newline
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>[Goodbye] and (Goodbye) along with Hellofrancis.Goodbye = Goodbye
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure how I configure my <code>re.sub</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import re

foo = re.escape("Hello")
bar = re.escape("Goodbye")
line = "[Hello] and (Hello) along with Hellofrancis.Hello = Hello"
newline = re.sub("\\b" + foo + "\\b", bar, line)
print (newline)
</code></pre>
<p>That should do what you are looking for.  re.sub takes requires 3 params.  What you are replacing, to what, and the text.  The \b is a word boundry. notice the Hellofrancis won't change as per your request to contigious.  I also escaped your foo and bar so if the data coming in has regex characters like a period it won't mess with your output.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You mean <code>newline = line.replace(foo, bar)</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b><code>re.sub</code></b></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">if its a fixed character string...why are you using regex? Just use <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_replace.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">replace</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Given <code>line="HelloGoodbye"</code>, should <code>newline</code> be updated to <code>"GoodbyeGoodbye"</code> or remain <code>"HelloGoodbye"</code>? In other words, should you take word boundaries into account?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I realise my lack of clarity. It must be regex since foo may occur as a match contiguous to an a-z or A-Z character. In which case it should not be replaced.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is amazing! I would never have thought to do it this way. Simple and effective. Tried it and it works.</span>
