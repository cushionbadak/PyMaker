<p>I'm new to Python and I was trying to get a "price tag String" to get converted into a float, so I can easily compare the result with other prices.
I searched for 2 hours for a answer for this "simple problem", but none of them fitted my needs.</p>
<p>So basically, I have a price like this:</p>
<pre><code>1.222.333,44 EUR
</code></pre>
<p>(comma and period swapped because I live in Germany, which is also pretty annoying)</p>
<p>And I want to get this for easy comparing:</p>
<pre><code>1222333.44
</code></pre>
<p>The main idea is to compare prices, which is my school project.<br/>
I used to do everything with php, which worked, but was way too slow.  </p>
<p>If you have a more elegant or simple way, please let me know.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This work for the specific case you provided:</p>
<pre><code>float(s.replace('.', '').replace(',', '.').split(' ')[0])
</code></pre>
<p>It requires:</p>
<ol>
<li>Periods in price are only separators;</li>
<li>Only one comma in price and is just a decimal mark;</li>
<li>The price comes first and is separated from other strings by a whitespace.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just to mention in case people need more generalized solution, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44487462/python-extract-number-from-string/44487500#44487520">hiro protagonist's answer</a> using <code>locale</code> is very helpful when you need a simple way to switch between numeral systems during coding or when maintaining your codes.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can use your (or any) <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">locale</a> to convert a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html#locale.atof" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string to a float</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import locale
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'de_DE.UTF-8')
print(locale.atof('1.222.333,44'))  # -&gt; 1222333.44
</code></pre>
<p>depending on your default locale you may not even have to specify the locale.</p>
<p>in your case you may need to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>split</code></a> the currency (EUR) part away:</p>
<pre><code>price = '1.222.333,44 EUR'
price_float = locale.atof(price.split()[0])
print(price_float) # -&gt; 1222333.44
</code></pre>
<p>note: it may be enough not to set<code>LC_ALL</code> but just <code>LC_NUMERIC</code> to what you need.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>If your string is "1.222.333,44 EUR"</strong></p>
<pre><code>prince = "1.222.333,44 EUR"
price = price[:-4]
price = price.replace(".","").replace(",",".")
floatprice = float(price)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>If it is just like this "1.222.333,44"</strong></p>
<pre><code>floatprice = float("1.222.333,44".replace(".","").replace(",","."))
