<p>I have been doing some research and can't find any information on the topic. I am running a <strong>Windows 10</strong> version that has a GPS feature for apps to use, this can be enabled or disabled by the user. I want to know how to access and use it through a python script, assuming it is even possible. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I don't want any solution to get the location through an IP geolocation service. Much like using the gps service of a mobile device in android apps. </p>
<p>Preferably python3 libs and modules.</p>

<p>On one hand, from the Microsoft <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/library/windows/desktop/dd464636(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Location API</a> documentation you will find, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/library/windows/desktop/dd317695(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LocationDisp.DispLatLongReport</a> object which has these properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Altitude</li>
<li>AltitudeError</li>
<li>ErrorRadius</li>
<li>Latitude</li>
<li>Longitude</li>
<li>Timestamp</li>
</ul>
<p>And on the other hand by using Python <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pywin32</a> module (or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ctype</a> module), you will get access to the Windows API (or any Windows DLL), so finally you could get the Lat &amp; Long as you want.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Only one application can access  GPS data at the same time. Location API and GPS data is  different. Location API use external connection but GPS work localy. I haven't any win10 device  include a GPS sensor. Mean far to bid an example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How about some concrete examples</span>
