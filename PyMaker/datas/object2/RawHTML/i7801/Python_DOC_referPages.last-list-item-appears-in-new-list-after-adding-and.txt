<p>I'm learning Python and having issues with this code. I'm using a for loop to cycle through the list and I need it to print the word <code>'and'</code> before the last item. I have got it to work, but not the way I want it to. </p>
<p>Instead of <code>'and ' + last item</code> appearing inside the list, it appears outside of it when I print. Can someone give me a clue as to what I'm doing wrong?</p>
<pre><code>listToPrint = []
while True:
    newWord = input("Enter a word to add to the list (press return to stop adding words) &gt; ")
    if newWord == "":
        break
    else:
        listToPrint.append(newWord)
for i in range(1):
    print(listToPrint[0:-1], end =', ' + 'and ' + listToPrint[-1])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can simply <code>str.join()</code> a slice of your words sans the last one and print the last one in line:</p>
<pre><code>print("{}, and {}".format(", ".join(listToPrint[:-1]), listToPrint[-1]))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The following code does what you seem to be wanting. </p>
<pre><code>listToPrint = []
while True:
    newWord = input("Enter a word to add to the list (press return to stop adding words) &gt; ")
    if newWord == "":
        break
    else:
        listToPrint.append(newWord)
listToPrint[-1] = "and " + listToPrint[-1]

print(listToPrint)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The slice of a list returns a list. <code>listToPrint[0:-1]</code> is a list, so the closing square brace appears before the <code>','</code>, if that's what you mean.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I thought that's what was happening, but I don't know how else to approach this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I made one minor change print("{}, and {}".format(", ".join(listToPrint[:-1]), listToPrint[-1])), but this is what I'm looking for. Can you explain this code or tell me where I can learn what this is?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KennyFreeman - you can also use your original statement as: <code>print(", ".join(listToPrint[:-1]), end=", and " + listToPrint[-1] + "\n") </code>, but <i>(opinion time)</i> it's better to control your output formatting whenever you can and I find it more readable anyway.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I like the way you originally did it. I just didn't know you could format like you did with a string. What is that called?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KennyFreeman - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.format()</code></a> is the native and a preferred way to do complex string formatting in Python. You can read more on its use at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Format String Syntax</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok, thanks a lot.</span>
