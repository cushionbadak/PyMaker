<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Consider the following XML code.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;data&gt;
    &lt;element&gt;This is the first sentence.&lt;button&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;some more text.
&lt;/element&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I am using Python module xml.etree.ElementTree.
I know that I can access to elements and texts with the following Python code</p>
<pre><code>import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

name = 'data.xml'
tree = ET.parse(name)
root = tree.getroot()
element = root[0].tag
first_text = root[0].text #This is the first sentence
button = root[0][0].tag #button
buttontext = root[0][0].text #click
</code></pre>
<p>But how do I access to text "some more text" with Python?
I haven't found the solution yet...
You can also suggest some other Python module if it's better way to do that.</p>
<p>That XML-code is just an example.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you are looking for the <code>.tail</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.Element.tail" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html#xml.etree.ElementTree.Element.tail</a></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Use lxml library, it is way faster than the ET. Also, you could use xpath.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! That seems to be working.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">great, please mark the answer as accepted. also consider lxml in case you need performance.</span>
