<p>I got a value error and even if I try playing around with the code, it doesn't work!</p>
<p>How can I get it right? - I am using Python 3.3.2!</p>
<p>Here is the code: <img alt="Code" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PYT80.png"/></p>
<p>As you can see, the program asks for how many miles you can walk and gives you a response depending on what you type in.</p>
<p>This is the code in text format:</p>
<pre><code>print("Welcome to Healthometer, powered by Python...")
miles = input("How many miles can you walk?: ")
if float(miles) &lt;= 0:
    print("Who do you think you are?!! Go and walk 1000 miles now!")
elif float(miles) &gt;= 10:
    print("You are very healthy! Keep it up!")
elif float(miles) &gt; 0 and miles &lt; 10:
    print("Good. Try doing 10 miles")
else:
    print("Please type in a number!")
    miles = float(input("How many miles can you walk?: "))
    if miles &lt;= 0:
        print("Who do you think you are?!! Go and walk 1000 miles now!")
    elif miles &gt;= 10:
        print("You are very healthy! Keep it up!")
    elif miles &gt; 0 and miles &lt; 10:
        print("Good. Try doing 10 miles")
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is exactly what the Traceback log says: <code>Could not convert string to float</code></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a string with only numbers, python's smart enough to do what you're trying and converts the string to a float.</li>
<li>If you have a string with non-numerical characters, the conversion will fail and give you the error that you were having.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way most people would approach this problem is with a <code>try/except</code> (see <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), or using the <code>isdigit()</code> function (see <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_isdigit.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Try/Except</strong></p>
<pre><code>try:
    miles = float(input("How many miles can you walk?: "))
except:
    print("Please type in a number!")
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Isdigit()</strong></p>
<pre><code>miles = input("How many miles can you walk?: ")
if not miles.isdigit():
    print("Please type a number!")
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the latter will still return false if there are decimal points in the string</p>
<h2>EDIT</h2>
<p>Okay, I won't be able to get back to you for a while, so I'll post the answer just in case.</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    try:
        miles = float(input("How many miles can you walk?: "))
        break
    except:
        print("Please type in a number!")

#All of the ifs and stuff
</code></pre>
<p>The code's really simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will keep trying to convert the input to a float, looping back to the beginning if it fails.</li>
<li>When eventually it succeeds, it'll break from the loop and go to the code you put lower down.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to take into account that the user might not fill in a proper value:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    miles = float(input("How many miles can you walk? "))
except ValueError:
    print("That is not a valid number of miles")
</code></pre>
<p>A <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>try/except</code></a> handles the <code>ValueError</code> that might occur when <code>float</code> tries to convert the input to a float.</p>

<p>The traceback means what it says on the tin.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; float('22')
22.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; float('a lot')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'a lot'
</code></pre>
<p><code>float</code> can convert strings that look like valid decimals into <code>float</code>s.  It can't convert arbitrary alphanumeric strings, notably including <code>'How am I supposed to know?'</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to handle arbitrary user input, you have to catch this exception, with a <code>try/except</code> block.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"If you have a string with only numbers, python's smart enough to do what you're trying and converts the string to a " is so annoying — I'm trying to load housing IDs which are all numbers, and Python tries to apply a ton of magic to turn them into floats, and using str() doesn't help</span>
