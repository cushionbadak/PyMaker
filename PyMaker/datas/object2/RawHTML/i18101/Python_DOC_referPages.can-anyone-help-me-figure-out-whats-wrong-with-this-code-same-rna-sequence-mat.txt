<p>Here is what I have so far: There seems to be an error in prompting the user for two sequences.</p>
<pre><code>def matchSequences(sequence1, sequence2):

    numMatches = 0

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It seems to me that instead of <code>(input("Enter the RNA sequences")==(sequence1, sequence2)</code> you should have something like this:</p>
<pre><code>sequence1, sequence2 = input("Enter the RNA sequences, seperated by a comma: ").split(",")
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, you don't need the function to have parameters, you can just do <code>def matchSequences()</code>.</p>
<p>If you <em>want</em> to use parameters, remove the line with input, keep your original <code>def matchSequences(sequence1, sequence2)</code> and instead of just doing this:</p>
<pre><code>matchSequences()
</code></pre>
<p>do this:</p>
<pre><code>first_sequence = input("Enter the first sequence: ")
second_sequence = input("Enter the second sequence: ")
matchSequences(first_sequence, second_sequence)
</code></pre>
<p>or this:</p>
<pre><code>matchSequences(*input("Enter the RNA sequences, seperated by a comma: ").split(","))
</code></pre>

<p>You could try something like:</p>
<pre><code>sequences = tuple(seq for seq in raw_input().split("."))

<p>Where a pair of sequences is formatted:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You appear to be missing a closing <code>)</code> in the line <code>(input("Enter the RNA sequences")==(sequence1, sequence2)</code>  Also please specify what you mean by "There seems to be an error" - Is there an actual error message (if yes post it)? Is the result different from what you expect (if yes, what do you expect and what is happening)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yup, fixed it. But there's still an error: Traceback (most recent call last):   File "E:\Assignment5.py", line 26, in &lt;module&gt;     matchSequences() TypeError: matchSequences() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'sequence1' and 'sequence2'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As that error message is telling you, you have defined your function as taking two parameters (sequence1 and sequence2) but you are trying to call it without passing those two parameters</span>
