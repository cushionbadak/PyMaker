<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am using Python 3.2 for Windows with Tkinter 8.5.  Does anyone knows if it is possible to open text file by selecting an item on a listbox and display the text file contents on a text widget?  Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>def starters_menu():
        self.listBox.delete(0, END)
        starters_menu = open("starters_menu.txt")
        for line in starters_menu:
            line = line.rstrip()
            self.listBox.insert(END, line)
        self.listBox.bind("&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;", recipe_title, add="+")
        self.listBox.bind("&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;", recipe_ingredients, add="+")
    recipe_menu.add_command(label="Starters, Snacks and Savouries", command=starters_menu)
</code></pre>
<p>I need help to write the definition for "recipe_ingredients" so that when the item in the list is selected, a text file linked to the item is opened and its contents displayed in text widget.  I need to know how how to link a file to the listbox item and how to call it using the handler shown in the code above.</p>

<h2>Text Files</h2>
<p>You can open a text file and dump it's contents into a string like so:</p>
<pre><code>textFile = open(filename, 'r')
#open() returns a file object
#'r' opens the file for reading. 'w' would be writing
textString = textFile.read()
#This takes the file object opened with the open() and turns it into a string which
#you can now use textString in a text widget.
</code></pre>

<h2>Linking listbox with text files</h2>
<p>To link listbox items with a text files, I suppose you could have all the things you are putting in the listbox in a dictionary, <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow">more info here</a>. Unlike arrays or lists, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. So for instance you could have a filename as the key and whatever you want in the listbox as the value.</p>
<p>I hope I helped a bit.</p>
