<p>How do I get a python program to do nothing with if statement?</p>
<pre><code> if (num2 == num5):
     #No changes are made
</code></pre>
<p>Please help!</p>

<p>You could use a <code>pass</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>if condition:
    pass
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-pass-statement" rel="noreferrer">Python 3.x documentation</a></p>
<p>However I doubt you want to do this, unless you just need to put something in as a placeholder until you come back and write the actual code for the <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p>If you have something like this:</p>
<pre><code>if condition:        # condition in your case being `num2 == num5`
    pass
else:
    do_something()
</code></pre>
<p>You can in general change it to this:</p>
<pre><code>if not condition:
    do_something()
</code></pre>
<p>But in this specific case you could (and should) do this:</p>
<pre><code>if num2 != num5:        # != is the not-equal-to operator
    do_something()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>pass</code> command is what you are looking for. Use <code>pass</code> for any construct that you want to "ignore". Your example uses a conditional expression but you can do the same for almost anything.</p>
<p>For your specific use case, perhaps you'd want to test the opposite condition and only perform an action if the condition is false:</p>
<pre><code>if num2 != num5:
    make_some_changes()
</code></pre>
<p>This will be the same as this:</p>
<pre><code>if num2 == num5:
    pass
else:
    make_some_changes()
</code></pre>
<p>That way you won't even have to use <code>pass</code> and you'll also be closer to adhering to the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="noreferrer">"Flatter is better than nested" convention in PEP20</a>.</p>

<p>You can read more about the <code>pass</code> statement <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#pass-statements" rel="noreferrer">in the documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>if condition:
    pass
</code></pre>
<pre><code>try:
    make_some_changes()
except Exception:
    pass # do nothing
</code></pre>
<pre><code>class Foo():
    pass # an empty class definition
</code></pre>
<pre><code>def bar():
    pass # an empty function definition
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can use pass inside if statement.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use continue </p>
<pre><code>if condition:
    continue
else:
    #do something
</code></pre>
