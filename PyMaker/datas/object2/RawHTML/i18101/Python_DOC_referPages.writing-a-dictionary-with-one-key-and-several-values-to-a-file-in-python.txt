<p>Im trying to save a dictionary into a file 
the dictionary has 1 key and 3 values</p>
<pre><code>person[name]=(bd,email,homepage)
</code></pre>
<p>this is the way I saved my dictionary 
What is the problem with my code? I've been trying to fix it for about a hour 
thanks!</p>

<p>If you do not need a user readable representation, take a look at the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle module</a> which does object serialization.</p>
<p>If you need something readable, a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">JSON encoder</a> is included in the standard library, wjich will serialize the basic datatypes (strings, numbers, lists, dictionaries).</p>

<p>Your general approach is wrong here and I don't know if I should be doing your homework, but here's a version of the program that you wrote that works:</p>
<pre><code># Request the file name
file_name=raw_input("Where would you like to save the file?(the file name will be dits)")

# Open the file
output=open(file_name+"dits.txt","w")
keys=person.keys()

# Iterate through the keys and write the values to each line
try:
    for key in keys:
        output.write(key+" ")
        output.write(" ".join([str(val) for val in person[key]]))   # Write all values to a line
        output.write("\n")
finally:
    output.close()
</code></pre>
<p>It's a little more general than yours (just writes the string version of all values to the file), but I figure someone with less specific needs might read this at some point.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is only for if you specifically want a space-delimited list of keys plus the values in the way the original question was worded. For anyone without these very specific requirements, I agree that pickle or json or some other standard serialization format is preferable!</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>for xrange in 3</code>: Integers are not iterable. Probably you wanted: <code>for i in xrange(3):...</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you incrementing a counter?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because I know there are 3 values so that the loop will end when the values end</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A lot of this stuff here is unnecessary. You're not incrementing anything in your for loop (which itself is not necessary).  Try something like this: <code>outstr = " ".join(v); output.write(outstr);</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Whoa, no, stop.  Use <code>json</code>, <code>shelve</code>, or <code>pickle</code> to handle your data serialization.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need to use the core commands of python for file saving like write</span>

<span class="comment-copy">By that do you mean you want to avoid importing modules? If so, why?</span>
