<p>This runs ok:</p>
<pre><code>x={'1':100,'2':200,'3':300}
print("I scored %(1)s"%x)
</code></pre>
<p>This doesn't:</p>
<pre><code>x={1:100,2:200,3:300}
print("I scored %(1)s"%x)
</code></pre>
<p>How do I modify the print() statement so that it accesses the dict item with integer key 1 ?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>%(name)x</code> format <em>always</em> uses strings to look up the name in the dictionary.</p>
<p>Use the newer <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>str.format()</code> method</a> instead:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x={1:100,2:200,3:300}
&gt;&gt;&gt; "I scored {0[1]}".format(x)
'I scored 100'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Note that your problem is not with the <code>print()</code> statement (which is really a function, not a statement), but rather with the <code>%</code> operator as applied to strings.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks Martijn - wonder what is so wrong with my question - it is clear - it is relatively gerneral - I realise it's very basic but that isn't a criteria for down-voting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">FWIW, I <i>upvoted</i>, because you showed what you tried, and it is clear to me what output you expect. The documentation does mention that mapping key <i>consist[s] of a parenthesised sequence of characters</i>, but that is reasonably obscure enough to find.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters thanks ... any question in connection with <code>C#</code> or <code>Python</code> get down-voted if they are not advanced enough for the readers taste! The <code>sql</code> community is a lot more forgiving and questions don't get down-voted nearly as much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nah, I don't quite agree with that assessment. Don't worry too much about this one. We currently have a persistently grumpy member in the Python community (temp banned before for overly condescending behaviour), you must have caught some people on an overly grumpy time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 thanks Martijn - <code>print("I scored {0[1]}".format(x))</code> does exactly what I want.</span>
