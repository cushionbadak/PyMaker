<p>I am not sure if this is the right way to ask the question, but here it goes.</p>
<p>I have a class say </p>
<pre><code>class T_shape(Shape):
    def __init__(self, center):
         coords = [Point(center.x - 1, center.y),
                   Point(center.x,     center.y),
                   Point(center.x + 1, center.y),
                   Point(center.x,     center.y + 1)]
    Shape.__init__(self, coords, 'yellow')
    self.center_block = self.blocks[1]
</code></pre>
<p>This class has been coded by someone else, I just wanted to ask what would be the right way to pass the parameters. Center is this case is tuple like (3,4). But when I try to pass it directly in this manner, it says 'tuple' object has no attribute 'x'. </p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am not sure what kind of object <code>center</code> is, or T_shape constructor is expecting?
But you can achieve with namedtuple.</p>
<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple
center = namedtuple('center', ['x', 'y'], verbose=True)
center = center(x=3,y=4)
t_shape = T_Shape(center)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Could pass a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" rel="nofollow noreferrer">collections.namedtuple</a> (in lieu of any other documentation that indicates what to do...)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks this solved the problem.</span>
