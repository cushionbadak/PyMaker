<p>I wrote this program in order to be able to find the number of A/U and C/G pairs from the users input. When I run it, it keeps saying "Invalid Syntax" while highlighting the first "else:" after the while loop in red. Anyone know what I need to change to fix it? </p>
<pre><code>def main():

    first = input("Please enter the RNA sequence for which you wish to find the number of pairs. \nFirst line:")
    second = input("Second String:")

    a1base = first.count('A')
    u1base = first.count('U')
    c1base = first.count('C')
    g1base = first.count('G')
    a2base = second.count('A')
    u2base = second.count('U')
    c2base = second.count('C')
    g2base = second.count('G')

    while (a1base &gt;= 1) and (u1base &gt;= 1) or (a2base &gt;= 1) and (u2base &gt;= 1):
        abases = (a1base+ a2base)
        ubases = (u1base + u2base)
        firstset = min(abases, ubases)
        print("You have", firstset,"A/U bases.")
        else:
            print("You have zero A/U bases.")

    while (c1base &gt;= 1) and (g1base &gt;= 1) or (c2base &gt;= 1) and (g2base &gt;= 1):
        cbases = (c1base + c2base)
        gbases = (g1base + g2base)
        secondset = min(cbases, gbases)
        print("You have", secondset,"C/G bases.")

<p>You have an <code>else:</code> that isn't attached to any <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, or <code>try</code> statement, which is illegal.</p>
<p>If you meant for the <code>else</code> to be attached to the <code>while</code>, the solution is simple: Change the indentation to attach it:</p>
<pre><code>while (a1base &gt;= 1) and (u1base &gt;= 1) or (a2base &gt;= 1) and (u2base &gt;= 1):

<p>Your <code>else</code> needs to be indented at the same level as your <code>while</code>, which doesn't really make sense in this case because there's no <code>break</code> in your loop, or you need to add an <code>if</code> on some line before it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I see two obvious things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everything after <code>def main():</code> should be indented;</li>
<li><code>Else</code> should be at the same level of indentation as <code>while</code>. It is not a child, but a sibling of <code>while</code>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Others have already explained the error.</p>
<p>Try changing you <code>while</code> loops to this:</p>
<pre><code>abases = (a1base+ a2base)
ubases = (u1base + u2base)
firstset = min(abases, ubases)
print("You have", firstset if firstset else 'zero',"A/U bases.")

cbases = (c1base + c2base)
gbases = (g1base + g2base)
secondset = min(cbases, gbases)
print("You have", secondset if secondset else 'zero',"C/G bases.")
</code></pre>
<p>Without any <code>while</code> or <code>else:</code>.</p>
<p>Also the following snippet should do the same thing:</p>
<pre><code>first = input("Please enter the RNA sequence for which you wish to find the number of pairs. \nFirst line:")
second = input("Second String:")
bases = {k: (first + second).count(k) for k in 'AUCG'}
print('You have', min(bases['A'], bases['U']), 'A/U bases.')
print('You have', min(bases['C'], bases['G']), 'C/G bases.')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>Why does it keep saying invalid syntax?</code> =&gt; Usually because your syntax is invalid. In your case, your else indentation does not match any if, for or while.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As a side note, this is not a "coding-style" question. Coding style is about choosing between different legitimate ways to write or lay out equivalent, valid code, not about writing valid code in the first place.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But the <code>else</code> block will always be called in this case. Doesn't make sense.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OlehPrypin Your badly indented <code>else</code> makes even less sense.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OlehPrypin: True, but trying to guess what the OP was actually trying to do is a mug's game. Maybe he wanted to break after the first <code>print</code>, in which case he needs to add a <code>break</code>. Or maybe he wanted to keep track of whether any <code>print</code>s had occurred and only do the <code>else</code> if none did, in which case he's misusing <code>else</code>. Or maybe he wanted something completely different. I have no ideaâ€”but in any case, he first has to get the code compiling before he can figure out what to do next.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Hyperboreus: I don't think OlehPrypin is the OP here. Except in the sense that his initials are "OP". :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry both of you. As OP's loops don't have an exit condition and the variables in the initial condition are never altered, I guess the <code>while</code>s should be <code>if</code>s. But this is just consulting my crystal ball.</span>
