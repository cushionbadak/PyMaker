<p>I will take an example first so that my question will be clear</p>
<p>Assume,</p>
<pre><code>a,b = method1()
</code></pre>
<p>method1 in above statement will return both a,b values, but I will require only variable "b" throughout my program. </p>
<p>Is there any placeholder kind of thing in python so that it is not required to name the variable "a"</p>
<p>Something like,</p>
<pre><code>_,b = method1()
</code></pre>
<p>is required. Thanks in advance</p>

<p>In Python versions 2.x, since <code>_</code> is a valid variable name, what you wrote would work:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; _, b = method1()
</code></pre>
<p>You could use a name like <code>_ignore</code> to make your intention clearer. If you really need to not keep the variable around, just <code>del _ignore</code> on the next line.</p>
<p>From version 3.0 of Python, you can do this even with an arbitrary number of extra values:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def method():
...    return 1, 2, 3

&gt;&gt;&gt; *_, b = foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
3
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">.. something a <i>lot</i> like that.  What happened when you tried it? ;^)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What @DSM said... and maybe <code>b = method1()[1]</code> so you don't even have a placeholder :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JonClements This is even better because of some weird side-effects when for example <code>a</code> refers to current frame which holds a reference to <code>a</code> (circular reference which causes troubles for garbage collector). This is a well known issue with <code>sys.exc_info()</code>.</span>
