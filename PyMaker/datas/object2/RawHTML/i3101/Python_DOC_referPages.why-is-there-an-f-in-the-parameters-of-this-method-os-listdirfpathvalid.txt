<p>I was taking the fast.ai course and came across this snippet of code (in Python 3):</p>
<pre><code>PATH = "data/dogscats/"
os.listdir(f'{PATH}valid')
</code></pre>
<p>This returns the list of the files in the directory <code>data/dogscats/valid</code>, like I expected. However, I don't understand what purpose the "f" in front of <code>'{PATH}valid'</code> serves. When removed, the code throws a "FileNotFound" error. Why is the "f" there? It's not even part of the string? I know this might be an elementary question, but it's something I'd love to understand.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>It's new in Python 3.6, introduced in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 498</a>, and it's called an <code>f-string</code> for <em>formatted string literal</em>. There are many ways to do similar things in Python; the oldest is the standard string interpolation using <code>%</code>, then the string <code>.format()</code> method, and now <code>f-strings</code>, for e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '%svalid' % 'data/dogscats/'
'data/dogscats/valid'
&gt;&gt;&gt; '{PATH}valid'.format(PATH='data/dogscats/')
'data/dogscats/valid'
&gt;&gt;&gt; PATH = 'data/dogscats/'
&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{PATH}valid'
'data/dogscats/valid'
</code></pre>
<p>It can be more than just a substitution of values however, as you can actually evaluate expressions as well:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; f'The value of {x}^2 is {x**2}'
'The value of 5^2 is 25'
</code></pre>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs on <code>f-strings</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>formatted string literal</em> or <em>f-string</em> is a string literal that is prefixed with <code>'f'</code> or <code>'F'</code>. These strings may contain replacement fields, which are expressions delimited by curly braces <code>{}</code>. While other string literals always have a constant value, formatted strings are really expressions evaluated at run time.</p>

<p><code>f-string</code> is really an expression evaluated at runtime, not a constant value. In Python, an f-string is a literal string, prefixed with <code>f</code>, which contains expressions inside braces. The expressions are replaced with their values.</p>
<p>So, <code>f'{PATH}valid'</code> gets evaluated to <code>data/dogscats/valid</code>.</p>
