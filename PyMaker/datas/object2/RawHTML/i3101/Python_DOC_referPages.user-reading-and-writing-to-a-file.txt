<p>i am trying to write a program that if a user press 1, it reads the file, if 2, it write to the file and if 3, it erase the file. Unfortunately, the code stop working after the first input from user. Is it possible to write a function for that?</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    print("(1) Read the notebook")
    print("(2) Add note")
    print("(3) Empty the notebook")
    print("(4) Quit")

    user_input = input("Please select one: ")

    if user_input == 1:
        readfile = open("notebook.txt","r")
        content = readfile.read()
        print(content)
        readfile.close()

    elif user_input == 2:
        new_input = input("Write a new note: ")
        readfile = open("notebook.txt", "a")
        readfile.write(new_input)
        readfile.close()

    elif user_input == 3:
        readfile = open("notebook.txt", "w")
        readfile.close()

    elif user_input == 4:
        break

print("Notebook shutting down, thank you.")

<p>Python3 does not have separate <code>raw_input()</code> and <code>input()</code> functions for returning <code>int</code>s and <code>string</code>s. It only has <code>input()</code>, which returns a string. You are attempting to compare the output of <code>input()</code> (a <code>string</code>) to an <code>int</code>, for example on this line:</p>
<pre><code>if user_input == 1:
</code></pre>
<p>The solution is to use the <code>int()</code> function to get the types right, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>if int(user_input) == 1:
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that your user input should be an int. Use this instead :=&gt;"user_input = int(input("Please select one: "))"
And also you cannot write an integer to a file so use this: =&gt; "readfile.write("user_input")" or convert your user input to string before writing to the file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"Unfortunately, the code doesn't work as i intend."  Why not? What's breaking?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In what way is it not working as intended?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">in python 3, input returns a string not an integer</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>input</code> always returns a string. You need to convert it to <code>int</code> or check for string values e.g. <code>if user_input == '1':</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tgsmith61591 The code did not execute the if part.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I did use use int() earlier but the code didn't run at all. I will try that and see.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@superv could you please update your original question with what you mean by "not run at all"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks guys. I saw i did not add a line of code earlier on. i have done that and also add the int() conversion. The code seems to work but with few errors which i cant seems to find. here is the code:</span>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>readfile.write("user_input")</code> will not do what they want. That's not how to convert to string</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@roganjosh is right, its just going to write the string "user_input" to the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it's just an example</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did ask him to convert to string before writing to file</span>
