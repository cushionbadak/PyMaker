<p>Let's assume that I get number as string or hex or int and I want to convert to integer. I'm looking for a more generic form.</p>
<p>for example,
if I write:
int('0x10',16) then int('0x10') will throw exception.</p>
<p>if I write:
int('10') then int('10',16) will throw exception.</p>
<p>Do I need to check type with instanceof ?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If the string represents a valid hex, it is prefixed by <code>0x</code>. So, you could just check <code>value.startswith('0x')</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to specify the base (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>), when using int() on a hex value:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; _hex = hex(int("32"))
&gt;&gt;&gt; _hex
'0x20'
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(_hex, 0)  # 0 means: Python automatically detects hex or decimal
32
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Your question is unclear. And <code>int('10',16)</code> doesn't raise an exception.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you cast string to a int, you need to know the base which you are casting to.. you can't just assume it's decimal as long as there isn't any '0x' in it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you specify your object or clarify on what do you mean by ‘more generic form’....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what if he tries <code>int('1D')</code>, the OP question is unclear.</span>
