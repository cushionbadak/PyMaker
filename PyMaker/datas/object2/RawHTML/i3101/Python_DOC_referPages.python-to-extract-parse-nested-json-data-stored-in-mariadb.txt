<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I have inherited a "simple" web application written in PHP and stores most of the transaction data in one table on MariaDB by using json in a long_text field.  </p>
<p>I need to parse out the data so it can be put into a traditional relational database table(s).  Preferably using SQL and/or Python.  </p>
<p>This is the current table structure</p>

| id            | int(11)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |        
| client_name   | varchar(100) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |        
| invoice_total | varchar(45)  | YES  |     | NULL    |                |        
| invoice       | longtext     | NO   |     | NULL    |                |        
| user_id       | int(11)      | YES  | MUL | NULL    |                |        
| created       | datetime     | NO   |     | NULL    |                |        
| uuid          | varchar(70)  | NO   |     | NULL    |                |        
| paid          | tinyint(1)   | NO   |     | 0       |                |

<p>My question is how do I keep working my way through the data getting key:value information?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<ol>
<li>Fetch the row.</li>
<li>Use a python function to turn the JSON into a python structure.</li>
<li>Walk through the structure using python code.</li>
<li>Create <code>INSERT</code> statements as needed, and execute them.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, steps 2 and 3 are better done via the application language than via SQL.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">#1 - already done as I have shown.  #2 - that's what I'm trying to do, hence my question.  #3 - that's what I'm trying to do, hence my question.  #4 - obviously, which is why I didn't ask.</span>
