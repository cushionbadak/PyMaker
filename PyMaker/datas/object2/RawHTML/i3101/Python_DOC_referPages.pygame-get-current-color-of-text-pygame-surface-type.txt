<p>I want to randomize colors and change color for text every few seconds, so I want to make sure that I dont use the same color. How can I know the current color of text?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could define a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set</a> of the colors and use the difference of the set and the current color to get a set which only contains different colors. Then convert it into a list and use <code>random.choice</code> to pick a new color.</p>
<pre><code>import random

RED = (255, 0, 0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
# Define a set of the colors.
COLORS = {RED, GREEN, BLUE}
color = RED  # Current color.

for _ in range(50):
    # The difference of `COLORS` and the set `{color}` is
    # a set that doesn't contain `color`.
    difference = COLORS - {color}
    # Then you need to convert this set into a list in order
    # to use `random.choice`.
    color = random.choice(list(difference))
    print(color)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">So there is no way to know the current color, am I right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you store it in a variable, you know the current color. There's also the <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.get_at" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pygame.Surface.get_at</code></a> method which allows you to see which color a specific pixel of the text surface has, but you don't know if it's a pixel of the actual text or the transparent background of the surface, so you'd have to call <code>get_at</code> multiple times with a <code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loop until you get a non-transparent pixel. And because of the antialiasing there will be different shades of the color.</span>
