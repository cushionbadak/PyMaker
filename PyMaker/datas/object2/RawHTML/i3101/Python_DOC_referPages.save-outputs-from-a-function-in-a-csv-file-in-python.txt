<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I have created a function which takes in input from the user and then displays the required output. </p>
<p>The function is: <code>def getname(name, place)</code></p>
<p>Then the other code follows. In the end the user is asked name and place. The function searches the dataframe which I have imported and displays the result as the info of that name.</p>
<p>I would like these outputs to be exported to a csv file. Not really sure of how to begin my code in this case.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!!</p>

<p>Basic code to write to a csv is</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open('eggs.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    spamwriter = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=' ',
                        quotechar='|', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)
    spamwriter.writerow(['Spam'] * 5 + ['Baked Beans'])
    spamwriter.writerow(['Spam', 'Lovely Spam', 'Wonderful Spam'])
</code></pre>
