<p>Can anyone help me with this little problem that I am having in my program with Python 3?</p>
<p>I have to read 10 integers, store them in a vector and determine in which position of the vector is the greatest number read. but  is giving me an  error. this is my code:</p>
<pre><code>ma=[1,8,10,12,16,7,4,2,9,5]

for x in range (0,10):
    if (ma[x]%2==0):
        max=str (ma[0])


        for num in str (ma[x]+1):
            if(num&gt;max):
                    max=num
print (max)
</code></pre>
<p>i will really appreciate your help guys</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import numpy as np
l = [i for i in ma if i%2==0 else np.Nan]
maxIndex = l.index(max(l))
</code></pre>
<p>This should work if ma is your vector with 10 integers</p>

<p>I would recommend you look into the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python standard library</a>. Specifically, you might find <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the built-in <code>max()</code> function</a> useful.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">+1 for "built-in max", -1 for incorrect statement re spaces: python ignores spaces between function name and function arguments.</span>
