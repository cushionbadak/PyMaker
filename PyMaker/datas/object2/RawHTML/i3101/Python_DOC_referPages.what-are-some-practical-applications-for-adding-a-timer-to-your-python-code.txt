<p>I'm new to Python and trying to apply the lessons being taught (online) but unfortunately, I don't understand why they are asking for timer code. In your experience, why have you added timer code to your program? Can you give me some practical examples so I can better understand why?</p>
<p>Sorry if it's a dumb question - TIA.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Timers are often added in lesson code to show the difference between different coding options. i.e., there are more than one ways to do it, but which is fastest? You wouldn't run the code in production.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is "timer code"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by a "timer code"? Anyways, please provide a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>, and asking for examples is off-topic for SO. You should visit the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic">help center</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a> to see which types of questions can be asked here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry - don't have code to post (still learning how to write it) but I didn't understand why they were asking for this                                                      Using Time and Sleep Functions To time your code you will need to:     First, create a variable that records the start time (start_time), the point you      want to start timing your code     Next, create a variable that records the stop time (end_time), the point you      want to stop timing your code     Finally, to calculate the total runtime (tot_time) by subtracting the start_time      from end_time</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's a bad recommendation. To properly measure your code's efficiency use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>timeit</code> module</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! That's a practical application I can apply ....</span>
