<p>I want to change a Python 2 code to Python 3. In particular, I would like to change <code>a.itervalues</code> to <code>a.values</code>.</p>
<p>I would to know if it is possible to define a new function so that when the program comes across <code>.itervalues</code>, it will run my new function instead of its original one?</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>as @aws_apprentice said : go to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html</a> </p>
<p>specifically read this section  :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dict Fixes dictionary iteration methods. dict.iteritems() is converted
  to dict.items(), dict.iterkeys() to dict.keys(), and dict.itervalues()
  to dict.values(). Similarly, dict.viewitems(), dict.viewkeys() and
  dict.viewvalues() are converted respectively to dict.items(),
  dict.keys() and dict.values(). It also wraps existing usages of
  dict.items(), dict.keys(), and dict.values() in a call to list.</p>

<p>so all you need to do is run 2to3 script on your files and you customize your code to suit Python 3 convention. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">have you tried this first, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You want a 3rd function, that will call itervalues or values depending on your python version?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, ddor254. The problem can be solved by 2to3. However, I am interested to know how to replace a function by another. Can we use the idea of decorator?</span>
