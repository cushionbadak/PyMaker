<span class="comment-copy">This is explicit TLS, i.e. connect in plain on port 21 and upgrade to TLS. Implicit TLS means to start with the TLS handshake.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unfortunately, I have already seen that and I couldn't find a solution. The problem is that I use a network with a proxy limitation. When I want to use FTP I usually use FileZilla with connexion FTP with implicit TLS configuration and it works. What I want to do now is to translate what I am doing in FileZilla to Python.</span>
