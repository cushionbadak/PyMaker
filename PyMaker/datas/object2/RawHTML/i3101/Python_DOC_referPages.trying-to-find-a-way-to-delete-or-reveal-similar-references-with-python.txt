<p>I have a question and I need your help.
I have a word file which contains many references like:</p>
<p>[1] M.-H. Han, Y. Li, and C.-H. Hwang, "The impact of high-frequency characteristics induced by intrinsic parameter fluctuations in nano-MOSFET device and circuit," Microelectronics Reliability, vol. 50, pp. 657-661, 2010.</p>
<p>[2] E. Maricau and G. Gielen, "Computer-aided analog circuit design for reliability in nanometer CMOS," Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, IEEE Journal on, vol. 1, pp. 50-58, 2011.
.
.
.</p>
<p>It would be possible that some of these references are similar but their numbers be different. 
do you have any idea to find a way to delete or reveal similar references with #python?
thanks  </p>

<p>You can split the footnote text into a number and the rest of the reference:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; footnote = '[1] P. Wood, "Example Thesis," Some collection, pp 45-46, 2018'
&gt;&gt;&gt; number, reference = footnote.split(' ', 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; reference
'P. Wood, "Example Thesis," Some collection, pp 45-46, 2018'
</code></pre>
<p>Python has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong><code>Counter</code></strong></a> class which is useful for building histograms.</p>
<p>You can add the references to a <code>Counter</code> object and then query it for when there is more than one:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter

&gt;&gt;&gt; counter = Counter()
&gt;&gt;&gt; counter[reference] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>You can create a loop of all your footnotes:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for footnote in footnotes:
...     number, reference = footnote.split(' ', 1)
...     counter[reference] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>Then access the counts that are greater than <code>1</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; duplicates = [item for item, count in counter.most_common()
...               if count &gt; 1]
</code></pre>
