<p>I know there must be a really obvious answer, but it eludes me. Where does "/folder1/folder2/file.ext" save to in Python? In some code I thought (incorrectly) that it would save the file to a relative path, but when I checked folder2 it wasn't there. However, it seemed to still take up the hard disk space. I did a search on my hard drive and couldn't find the file. Where did it go? Again, I'm aware that there must be a really obvious answer out there, but I am just learning to code.</p>

<p>Firstly I would read about the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os</a> module and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path" rel="nofollow noreferrer">module search path</a>.</p>
<p>I opened the IDLE 3.7.0 on my Windows 10 machine and did the following:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.getcwd()
'C:\\Python37'
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.path.abspath('./folder1')
'C:\\Python37\\folder1'
</code></pre>
<p>Windows expands the <code>.</code> to represent the current working drive, thus wherever the interpreter is looking is where your folders will reside.</p>
<p>In the links, it talks about how <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sys.path</a> works (in short the directory containing the current script is placed at the front of it [e.g. the current working directory] for searching).</p>
<p>So, in short, either run your script directly from the directory or call <code>os.chdir('/your/desired/path')</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Paths that start with a <code>/</code> are absolute paths, not relative. (Except on Windows, where they're only absolute to the current working drive.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But this isn't really a Python question. Python treats paths the same way almost every other program in the universe does. If you don't understand what paths mean on your platform, that's probably a question for Super User, not Stack Overflow, and a question about your platform, not about Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert I'm using Windows, so if the current working drive is C, then the file would be in C:/folder1/folder2/ ? I'll make sure to post to SuperUser in the future with issues like this - thanks for the heads up.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@amateur3057 Exactly right. (Of course Windows usually uses backslashes rather than slashes as separators in paths, but most programs—including Python—allow you to use slashes instead. Because <code>/</code> isn't a valid character within a Windows filename, this doesn't cause any ambiguity.)</span>
