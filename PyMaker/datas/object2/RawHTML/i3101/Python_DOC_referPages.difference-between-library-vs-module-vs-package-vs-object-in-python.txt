<p>Can anyone explain the correct information?</p>

<p>object is instance of class</p>
<p>every file of Python source code whose name ends in a .py extension is a module</p>
<p>package is collection of modules. It is a directory which contains a special file <strong>init</strong>.py</p>
<p>Library is collection of various packages</p>
<p>A framework is a large codebase, or collection of code, meant to provide universal, reusable behavior for a targeted project ,frameworks are different from other external codebases, such as libraries, because they feature inversion of control</p>

<p>Module can be a script/library usually in the same working directory. Depending on your IDE this may take some more setup but in your working directory you can see this functionality.</p>
<p>create a new python script called print_stuff.py</p>
<p>In this script write the following:</p>
<pre><code>def print_a_string():
    print('Hello from print_stuff)
</code></pre>
<p>Then in a new script in that directory put the import</p>
<pre><code>from print_stuff import print_a_string as pas

pas()
</code></pre>
<p>A package is, as implied, a packaged module that is available to the python interpreter. This involves seting up an <strong>init</strong>.py, setup.py etc so that any script can use that package.</p>
