<p>The Chinese words read 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file.</p>
<p>I followed instructions on the Internet to solve this and did the followings. However, python is still not recognized. My computer runs windows 10 and my python version is 3.7. </p>
<p>I am a complete novice in programming. Your help means a lot to me. Thank you in advance. </p>

<p>Since Python 3.3, the installer automatically installs the <code>py</code> launcher on your path, and since 3.6, it doesn't put <code>python</code> itself on your path unless you enable a checkbox in the installer.</p>
<p>And that's fine, because you usually want to use <code>py</code> rather than <code>python</code> anyway. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Launcher for Windows</a> in the help.</p>
<p>If you really need <code>python</code> on your path, the recommended solution is to just re-run the installer, select Modify, and click the checkbox. If you want to do it manually, you can, but it really isn't necessary. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#finding-the-python-executable" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Finding the Python executable</a> in the docs for details.</p>

<p>You probably did not add Python to PATH 
Look for your installed Python inside C:\Program Files folder</p>
<p>Take note of the path of Python </p>
<pre><code>Ex. C:\Program Files\Pyhton37
</code></pre>
<p>Adding python directory to <code>PATH</code></p>
<p>Right click on <code>This PC</code>
Then click on <code>Properties</code>
At the pop up window, look for <code>Environment Variables</code>
At the first box look for PATH, double click it and press ADD. Add both <code>C:\Program Files\Python37</code> and <code>C:\Program Files\Python37\Scripts</code> inside. </p>
<p>Now try again</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you run <code>py</code> from the command line? The recommended way to run Python on Windows nowadays is with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>py</code> launcher</a>, which can handle things like multiple Python installations without you needing to understand how to monkey with environment variables and Explorer file associations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, instead of following random "instructions on the internet", which may be out of date, it's usually better to follow the instructions on python.org.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">abarnert, you are right. The links you gave me below address  my problem directly. I should always look up instructions on the official site first.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What instructions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MaxvonHippel The Python docs include <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Setup and Usage</a> for each version. (For <code>pip</code> and PyPI, see the Python Packaging User Guide](<a href="https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/)." rel="nofollow noreferrer">pypa.io/en/latest/).</a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow, it works. Thank you very much !!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You really don't need to do this. And probably don't want to, because it still won't help with things like Explorer file associations. Better to use <code>py</code> as recommended, or, if you really need a <code>python</code> command, to use the installer as intended.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah yes I read your answer. And it is indeed the correct way. However, I thought when he asked “how to add pyhton to cmd”, he was really asking how to add python on cmd. My bad.@abarnert</span>
