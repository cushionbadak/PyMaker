<p>As of right now, this produces false. I just want to know is it possible to set a variable to set up for like special formatted types of strings   </p>
<pre><code>sting_prime = str, str

x = "jon, doe" 

print (x == sting_prime)
</code></pre>
<p>so in this example, I want the string format to be a string with a comma followed by a space and another string. Since x is in that same format i would want it to produce True.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use regular expressions for this. The regular expression in the code below is pretty basic, but you can change it according to your need.</p>
<pre><code>import re


STRING_EXP = '[a-zA-Z]+' # basic expression to match ascii strings. write more complicated ones for your needs
INT_EXP = '[0-9]+'    # basic expression to match integer

schema = "{}, {}".format(STRING_EXP, STRING_EXP)
text = "jon, jdoe"
print(True if re.search(schema, text) else False) # prints True

text = "1, 2"
print(True if re.search(schema, text) else False) # prints False

# change schema
schema = "{}, {}".format(INT_EXP, INT_EXP)
print(True if re.search(schema, text) else False) # prints True
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">so you want to test if a string contains <code>', '</code>?  <code>print(',  ' in x)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expressions</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you elaborate a bit more? @KlausD.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@e.s. i wanna test that x is in the same format as string_prime. with your answer "jon ,doe" would be correct but for what i want to do it would be wrong</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I thought the linked docs would be detailed enough. If not there are many other sources on the internet.</span>
