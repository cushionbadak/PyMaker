<p>I want to take a random sample of k elements from a list, using python's random.sample.
The size of the population is not known a-priori, and in some cases it may be less then k: in this case I just want the whole list returned.</p>
<p>It looks to me a pretty common and straightforward use case, so I am wondering if there is a way to avoid this code that I find a bit verbose:</p>
<pre><code># whole_population is a list of elements
# k is an int with  the size of the sample needed
random.sample(whole_population, min(k, len(whole_population))
</code></pre>
<p>And instead have something like this:</p>
<pre><code>random.sample(whole_population, k, error_if_k_too_big=False)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could add an <code>if</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>if k &gt; len(whole_population):
    k = len(whole_population)
</code></pre>
<p>Meaning <code>k</code> will never be greater then the number of elements in <code>whole_population</code>, therefore the condition mentioned below will be met.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use error handling:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    return random.sample(whole_population, k)
except ValueError:
    return whole_population
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You can see the function docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. TL;DR: no. You could write your own wrapper function with this behaviour, though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think that first example looks all that verbose - if you wanted, you could simply do it on two lines, with the first being <code>sample_size = min(k, len(whole_population))</code> and the second being <code>random.sample(whole_population, sample_size)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">your code is fine as it is, clearer than any other alternative</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GreenCloakGuy yes after your answers I think too there are no better solutions. Doing it in 2 lines is effectively more clear</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem is that I cannot change the k as I will need to reuse it, so I would need to introduce another variable and so it becomes as verbose as the former one</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@magnum87 ah perhaps using <code>min(k, len(whole_population)</code> in the method call is the best idea then</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>except ValueError</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Edited. Good catch, it's always good to be descriptive in case other exceptions might be raised.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes exactly- "Good catch" is also a nice pun! I remain unconvinced this is better than the OP solution though</span>
