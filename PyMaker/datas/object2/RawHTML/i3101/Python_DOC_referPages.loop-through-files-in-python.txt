<p>I'm using python 3.6 on jupyter notebook.</p>
<p>I wrote this code to visualize some data.</p>
<pre><code>from nilearn import plotting

DMN = plotting.plot_glass_brain("/Users/projets/rmap_seeds/average_rmap_DMN.nii.gz",
                            draw_cross = True, colorbar=True)
plt.show()
</code></pre>
<p>I have many different files where I want to visualize</p>
<p>I want to do a for loop so I don't have to write them all manually. I just put two examples here, but in fact I have hundreds.</p>
<p>I tried this :</p>
<pre><code>image = {'average_rmap_DMN', 'average_rmap_CER'}

for i in image :
    image(i) = plotting.plot_glass_brain("/Users/projets/rmap_seeds/", 
    (image{i}), ".nii.gz", draw_cross = True, colorbar=True, threshold=0.7)
</code></pre>
<p>I get this error : </p>
<pre><code>SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks !</p>

<p>Python uses square brackets for indexing rather than curly braces, so you should do <code>image[i]</code> to remove the syntax error.
However, in python iterating over a list returns list items rather than indices.<br/>
Indexing with <code>i</code> won't work, but you can use it directly:</p>
<pre><code>for img in image:
    do_something(img)
</code></pre>
<p>Or alternatively using list comprehensions</p>
<pre><code>[do_something(img) for img in image]
</code></pre>
<p>You can assign the results of the list comprehension to a new variable if you wish to continue modifying it, so your code would become</p>
<pre><code>image = {'average_rmap_DMN', 'average_rmap_CER'}

res = [plotting.plot_glass_brain("/Users/projets/rmap_seeds/", 
    img, ".nii.gz", draw_cross = True, colorbar=True, threshold=0.7) 
    for img in image]
</code></pre>
<p>Lastly, judging by your code I'd recommend going through some introductory python tutorials.  Something like <a href="https://bastibe.de/2013-01-20-a-python-primer-for-matlab-users.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> that is aimed at matlab users might be a good place to start, or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this one</a> for general info.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your example, you have the two expressions <code>image(i)</code>, and <code>image{i}</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>image(i)</code> This is an issue because strings are not callable (you can't pass them arguments and have them work like functions). This is not a valid operation so an error would be thrown in that case. (The Python parser thinks you're trying to assign to a function call.)</p></li>
<li><p><code>image{i}</code> This would be a syntax error. <code>{i}</code> is a set literal, so your expression is like having <code>x 1</code>, which is invalid syntax in Python. If you were looking for indexing, that would be <code>image[i]</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But then there is the question: is <code>images</code> supposed to be a set or a dict? Because if it is a dictionary, then you are looping over the keys and it should be <code>images[i]</code>. However, if it is a set (which it appears to be what you're using), there are further problems.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sets cannot be indexed</li>
<li>You cannot index a lists or strings by a string.</li>
</ol>
<p>The indexing by strings issue, when you say <code>for string in strings:</code>, <code>string</code> is the string in the container, not an integer index to it.</p>
<p>So it seems like you have some more serious structural problems in your code. You should think of what data structures you need, and look into the methods of the builtin containers <code>list</code>, <code>dict</code>, <code>set</code>, <code>tuple</code>, etc.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You get this error at <code>image(i) = plotting.plot_glass_brain...</code> this line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please look up how to create and access a list -- you've created a dictionary and you're accessing it incorrectly</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This problem has nothing to do with the task you're trying to accomplish. <code>image(i)</code> attempts to call <code>image</code> as a function (giving <code>SyntaxError: can't assign to function call</code>, and <code>(image{i})</code> is trying to index with a set (I guess; that's how I mentally parse it but I don't know the exact route for it becoming a syntax error). <code>[i]</code> is the syntax for indexing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I changed it for [] and now I get this error : <code>TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bim1, my answer partially addresses that error.  Are you still having issues?</span>
