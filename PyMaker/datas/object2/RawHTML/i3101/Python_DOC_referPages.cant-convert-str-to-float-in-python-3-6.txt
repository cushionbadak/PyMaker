<p>I am getting this error "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" when i am trying to convert a str to float inorder to do summation.</p>
<pre><code># To Find sum of no. s  seperated by commas in a string 
  t=''
  y=''
  z=""
  s = "1.23,2.4,3.123"
  for x in s:
     if x != ',':
         y += x
     else: 
         t = z
         z = y
         y = ''
  print("y=",y,"z=",z,"t=",t)
  y = float(y)
  z = float(z)
  t = float(t)
  print("Sum is =",y+z+t)

<p>I see that you ran that code in Spyder. That is a great environment, which I use, but it does have one disadvantage. Any variables you have defined are still defined at the start of your code.</p>
<p>Almost certainly you have defined a variable with the name <code>float</code> that holds a string value. So your program tries to execute <code>y = float(y)</code> but misunderstands the meaning of <code>float</code>. We could have seen that if you had your "variable explorer` window visible, rather than the "help" window in your screenshot.</p>
<p>Try your program again after closing and restarting Spyder and see if you still get that error. And from now on, avoid using standard names like <code>float</code> for your variables.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">runs perfectly when i run it. you might want to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">split</a> method</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Somewhere you assigned a number to "float", though it isn't in the code you are showing.</span>
