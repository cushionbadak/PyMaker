<p>I trying to make below code case insensitive but its not working.</p>
<p>If i try to load exact name <code>!ping george</code> its workings but if i try to mix upper or lower <code>!ping George</code> bot not reply's.</p>
<pre><code>@bot.command(pass_context=True)
async def ping(ctx, namesList):
  with open('data.json') as json_file:
    d = json.load(json_file)
    for p in d['people']:
      if(p['Name'] in (namesList)):
        await bot.send_message(ctx.message.channel, p)
</code></pre>
<p>I changed this <code>if(p['Name'] in (list)):</code>  to   <code>if(p['Name'].lower() in (list)):</code></p>
<p>Still its not working i think i doing mistake in this line.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edit from comment:</p>
<pre><code>namesList # from json file names contains  with upper lower mixed.
some names contain numbers, and some names have space between name and sir name.

data.json sample

{"people": [
{"UserID": "xxxxx123", "Name": "Steve", "Sex": "Male", "age": "30"},
{"UserID": "xxxxx124", "Name": "Rachel", "Sex": "Female", "age": "25"},
{"UserID": "xxxxx125", "Name": "George", "Sex": "Male", "age": "22"} ] }
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can create a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set()</a> of lower-case names and look up your <code>p["Name"]</code> in it:</p>
<pre><code>@bot.command(pass_context=True)
async def ping(ctx, namesList):
  # sets are better for lookups. prepare a set with all lower case names 
  setOfNamesLowerCase = set ( x.lower() for x in namesList ) # dont name lists list
  with open('data.json') as json_file:
    d = json.load(json_file)
    for p in d['people']:
      if(p['Name'].lower() in setOfNamesLowerCase ):
        await bot.send_message(ctx.message.channel, p)
</code></pre>
<p>Sets are better suited for this task, lookup is O(1) and in case you have duplicates they get automatically reduced.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Logic reduced to check if it should work, given correct inputs:</p>
<pre><code>def find_tata(namesList):
    # sets are better for lookups. prepare a set with all lower case names 
    setOfNamesLowerCase = set ( x.lower() for x in namesList ) # dont name lists list
    if "tata" in setOfNamesLowerCase:
        print("Its in")
    else:
        print ("Its not")


find_tata( ["not in here","not in"])
find_tata( ["not in here","tata"])
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Its not
Its in
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Edit 2:</p>
<pre><code>import json

js = """{"people": [
    {"UserID": "xxxxx123", "Name": "Steve", "Sex": "Male", "age": "30"},
    {"UserID": "xxxxx124", "Name": "Rachel", "Sex": "Female", "age": "25"},

    for p in d['people']:
        if(p['Name'].lower() in setOfNamesLowerCase ):
            print("Doing smth for ", p["Name"])

<span class="comment-copy">You don't tell us what's in <code>list</code>. (Which by the way is a very, very <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bad name for a variable</a>.) Are the names in there all in lowercase as well?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In list from json file contains names with upper lower mixed some names contain numbers also.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's your problem then. How can <code>p['Name'].lower()</code> <i>ever</i> be found in a mixed-case string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So i trying find how to do it work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">now its not working for both correct names or lower upper names.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No response from bot or no error  raising.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bosen You should probably debug your values in that case. Most probably either <code>namesList</code> or whatever the json gives you as <code>p["Name"]</code> is not what you think it is. This might help you out: <a href="https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">How to debug small programs (#1)</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried your updated code but still bot didn't responded or not even received error code.now its not responding if i type same name exactly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bosen - see edit. The code as is works - so something that is not set/test related is amiss. anysc / await , the bots context, no idea...</span>
