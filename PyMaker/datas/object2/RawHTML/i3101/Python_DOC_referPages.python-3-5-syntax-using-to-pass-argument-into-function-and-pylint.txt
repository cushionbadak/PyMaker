<p>I'm currently using the PySpice module for circuit sim. PySpice is using some syntax implemented in Python 3.5 that I've never seen before: <a href="https://pyspice.fabrice-salvaire.fr/api/PySpice/Unit.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pyspice.fabrice-salvaire.fr/api/PySpice/Unit.html</a> I'd like to find the Python reference for this syntax.</p>
<p>Primarily, I'd like to get PyLint to recognize it.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That's the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html?highlight=matrix%20multiplication#whatsnew-pep-465" rel="nofollow noreferrer">matrix multiplication operator</a>. You can override it with <code>__matmul__</code> or <code>__rmatmul__</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">This is merely the new matrix multiplication operator. It actually doesn't have any built in implementation, rather, it was added for scientific computing libraries like <code>numpy</code> to distinguish matrix multiplication from other types.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you running PyLint on Python 3.5? Have you updated PyLint? It should recognize the syntax.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm on the latest version, Python 3.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I saw that it's used as a matrix multiplication operator. Assumed it was being used to pass an argument into a function. Guess I'm going to read the source code now to see how its implemented.</span>
