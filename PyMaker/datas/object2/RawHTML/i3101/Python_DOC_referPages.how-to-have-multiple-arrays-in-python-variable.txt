<p>Right now I have a small script that writes and read data to a CSV file.</p>
<p>Brief snippet of the write function:</p>
<pre><code>with open(filename,'w') as f1:
    writer=csv.writer(f1, delimiter=';',lineterminator='\n',)
    for a,b in my_function:
         do_things_to_get_data
         writer.writerow([tech_link, str(total), str(avg), str(unique_count)])
</code></pre>
<p>Then brief snippet of reading the file:</p>
<pre><code>infile = open(filename,"r")

for line in infile:
    row = line.split(";")
    tech = row[0]
    total = row[1]
    average = row[2]
    days_worked = row[3]
    do_things_with_each_row_of_data
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like to just skip the CSV part all together and see if I can just hold all that data in a variable but I'm not sure what that looks like. Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><code>...no point in me saving data to a csv file just to read it later in the script</code></p>
<p>Just keep it in a list of lists</p>
<pre><code>data = []
for a,b in my_function:
     do_things_to_get_data
     data.append([tech_link, str(total), str(avg), str(unique_count)])
</code></pre>
<p>...</p>
<pre><code>for tech, total, average, days_worked in data:
    do_things_with_each_row_of_data
</code></pre>

<p>It might be worth saving each <em>row</em> as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple" rel="nofollow noreferrer">namedtuple</a> or a dictionary</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What does it even mean "skip the CSV part all together"? Your question is unclear and, as such, unanswerable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think he's saying he stores the program's state in a csv file instead of a multi-dimensional array. At least that seems to be what I'm reading. In that case, <a href="https://pythonprogramming.net/python-3-multi-dimensional-list/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pythonprogramming.net/python-3-multi-dimensional-list</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">malan@ is correct. There's no point in me saving data to a csv file just to read it later in the script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">something so simple. thank you wwii@</span>
