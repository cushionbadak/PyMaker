<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've create a fonction in my code that need a lots of variable and constants from the program. So, I've use the <code>global</code> with my varible and it's really long : 5 lines make all variables global...</p>
<p>I'm scearching a new way to make easely all variables global !
Please help me</p>
<p>this is a perfect annoying exemple :</p>
<pre><code>( using pygame here but not important )

def GoWindow(w):
     global screen, a, a_max, barPos, barSize, borderColor, bgBar, background, bg_loaded, current_load, a_dif, a_db, a_da, bar_percent, White, Black, Grey, Blue, Dark_Blue, Red, Dark_Red, Green, Dark_Green, Font,... #and it's continue....
     if w == 'load' #rest of the fucntion
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>While I agree with the comments that there might be something wrong with the design of your program, you only need to declare <code>global</code> if you need to assign to those variables though.</p>
<pre><code>x = 5

def print_x():
    print(x)

def assign_x():
    x = 10

def assign_global_x():
    global x
    x = 10

print_x()  # prints 5
assign_x()  # does nothing (only changes the local `x`)
print_x()  # prints 5 (the global `x` is still 5)
assign_global_x()  # assigns 10 to the global x
print_x()  # prints 10 now
</code></pre>
<p>I.e. the output is</p>
<pre><code>5
5
10
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">if you're using this many globals then something is fundamentally wrong with your design</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How about iterating over the variables with a for loop?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The correct solution here is to stop using global variables. You <i>probably</i> want to encapsulate all of those variables in a class, but it's hard to say without any context.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am beginner at python, I use the GoWindow() custom function for any windows so for exemple when w = 'load' it show the loading window, when w = 'main', it show the main and etc, so there is all the variables for any window and I got 6 or 7 windows now ! If you know a way to make it better please help me</span>
