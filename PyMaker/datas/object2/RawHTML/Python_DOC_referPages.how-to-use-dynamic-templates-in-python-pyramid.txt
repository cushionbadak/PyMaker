<p>i've finished developing a website, it's working fine however i am trying to optimize my website by adding dynamic templates, and want to make sure that if it can be done on pyramid python.</p>
<p>for example, in my jinja template i have the following:</p>
<pre><code>{% block article_detail %}
    &lt;form action="{{request.route_url('Sports_News_Action',action=action)}}" method="post" class="form"&gt;
        {% if action =='edit' %}
            {{ form.id() }}
</code></pre>
<p>example in my controller:</p>
<pre><code>@view_config(route_name='Sports_News_Action', match_param='action=create',
             renderer='StarAdmin:templates/edit_sports.jinja2')
def general_create(request):
    entry = SportNews()
</code></pre>
<p>the request route will have to match the one in my controller in order to run the function. what i want to do is how do i replace the one in jinja with a dynamic variable, to use the one jinja template lets say for different views/controllers with different route_names.</p>

<p>I think in your situation the simplest solution is to leave <code>action</code> undefined and the browser will submit the request to the current url. You only need to specify <code>action</code> if you want to submit the form to a different url than the current. That being said, you can use lots of different options in pyramid to generate a url as well. For example, <code>request.url</code> is the current url, or <code>request.matched_route.name</code> is the name of the current matched route.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If I understand what you are asking, for every function, change the <code>route_name</code> arg in the decorator. Else update your question for clarity.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, but what i need to do is have a variable route_name instead of a fixed one, for every form action, i'll need to route it to a specific route upon submission, my question is. how do i use one temple with one action, one submit button for multiple route.</span>
