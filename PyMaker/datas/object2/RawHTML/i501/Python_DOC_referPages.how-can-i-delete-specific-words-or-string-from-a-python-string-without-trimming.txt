<p>I would like to know how to remove specific words from a string in python without deleting them from other words they composed.</p>
<p>For example if I want to remove 'is' from the following sentence:</p>
<pre><code>s = 'isabelle is in Paris'
</code></pre>
<p>The .replace() function delete 'is' in 'isabelle' and in 'Paris':</p>
<pre><code>s = 'isabelle is in Paris'
s.replace('is', '')
</code></pre>
<p>It gives me <code>abelle in Par</code> But I want <code>isabelle in Paris</code>. Is there a way to delete only 'is'?</p>
<p>I tried: <code>s.replace(' is ', '')</code> with a space each side of 'is' but in this case 'is' is not removed in the string <code>s = 'Isabelle is, as you know, in Paris'</code></p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Use a regular expression instead of replacing an ordinary string. You can then use <code>\b</code> in the regexp to match word boundaries.</p>
<pre><code>import re
s = re.sub(r'\bis\b', '', s)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I would suggest learning about Regular Expressions <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>. For example, you could possibly write a RegEx using <code>re.sub</code> or <code>re.replace</code></span>
