<p>I am trying to create a random list of 1 million numbers ranging between 1-100. I have found how to create a single random number but not to create a list of them. In addition, I would prefer to use the numpy uniform function but the solution doesn't have to use this. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For a big array, you'd better use numpy</p>
<pre><code> import numpy as np
 X = np.random.randint(1, 101, size=10**6)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this simpler one : </p>
<pre><code>from random import randint

my_list = [randint(1, 100) for i in range(1000000)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The function </p>
<pre><code>np.random.rand(Dim1,Dim2)
</code></pre>
<p>will create an array for the given dimensions with values selected from the uniform distribution [0,1]. You can modify this to <code>randomArray = 1 + 99 * np.random.rand(Dim1,Dim2)</code> to have the array with numbers ranging between 1-100.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>  from random import *
  mylist = []
  for i in range(0, 100):
        f = randint(0, 100)
        mylist.insert(i, f)
</code></pre>
<p>This code will give 100 random elements to your empty list.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>use this as simple as that...don't make your program more complex in code and in efficiency too..</p>
<pre><code>from random import randint
l=[randint(1,100) for i in range(0,1000000)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to Stack Overflow. Please <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tour">Take the Tour</a>, and be sure to read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">How do I ask a good question?</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why is there a numpy tag?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to use a generator expression <code>(randint(1, 100) for i in range(1000000))</code> because I doubt you need to keep every random number in memory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The size should be a million, that is <code>10**6</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>random.sample(range(1,100), 1000000)</code> will also work!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bro-grammer <code>range(1,101)</code>, but yes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chepner it is unclear from question whether 1-100 is inclusive or not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bro-grammer In what version? I get "ValueError: Sample larger than population"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tobias_k yes indeed it won't work! I need to change it to list comprehension each with sample size of <code>99</code>. But then it won't be much different.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But those will be floating point numbers, not integers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's true, I guess the OP can use either 'rand' or 'randint'  depending on their choice of application.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to move <code>mylist</code> initilization outside loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, sorry! You' re right.</span>
