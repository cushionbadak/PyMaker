<p>I am trying to get python3 running on my EspressoBin single board computer (aarch64). I have built a linux distribution using Marvell's <a href="https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/marvell-embedded-linux-platform" rel="nofollow noreferrer">openembedded</a> distribution and included <code>python3</code>.</p>
<p>The problem is that python's search paths/environment variables are not being set. </p>
<p>If I try to start python3, I get:</p>
<pre><code>Could not find platform independent libraries &lt;prefix&gt;
Could not find platform dependent libraries &lt;exec_prefix&gt;
Consider setting $PYTHONHOME to &lt;prefix&gt;[:&lt;exec_prefix&gt;]
Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encoding
ImportError: No module named 'encodings'

Current thread 0x0000007faef06000 (most recent call first):
Aborted
</code></pre>
<p>If, however, I do:</p>
<pre><code>$ export PYTHONHOME="/usr/lib64/python3.5/"
$ export PYTHONPATH="/usr/lib64/python3.5/:/usr/lib64/python3.5/lib-dynload"
$ python3
Python 3.5.1 (default, Jan 14 2019, 23:24:54) 
[GCC 5.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Then everything magically works.</p>
<p>So the question is... where/how are these things normally being set? I tried comparing to Ubuntu, but for some reason those environment variables aren't even present at all! I checked the docs on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sys.path</a> and it says that <code>sys.path</code> is populated from PYTHONPATH, "plus an installation-dependent default". So I'm guessing Ubuntu's "installation-dependent default" has the correct paths pre-populated?</p>
<p>My current solution is to just add those two environment variables to <code>/etc/environment</code>, as well as <code>/etc/profile</code> (for ssh connections), but this seems like a hacky workaround and I want to do it right.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The path <code>".../lib64/..."</code> to python3.5 does not look default, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By default, the libraries are searched in <code>prefix/lib/pythonversion</code>
  and <code>exec_prefix/lib/pythonversion</code> " <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/using/cmdline.html#environment-variables" rel="nofollow noreferrer">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I guess that it could be related to that and if you could reinstall or modify it to be installed in <code>"/lib/"</code> instead of <code>"/lib64/"</code> you wouldn't need to set those two environment variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Starting with Modules/getpath.c in Python source tree would not be a bad idea.</p>
<p>Oh, and: there seems to be a version mismatch? Python is 3.6, yet you provide 3.5 modules to it?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Indeed, adding a softlink <code>/usr/lib/python3.5 -&gt; /usr/lib64/python3.5</code> seems to fix the issue (I'm able to eliminate the environment variables). <code>lib64</code> must be some installation prefix openembedded is choosing because of the architecture <code>aarch64</code>... I'll have to look into it. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Confirmed that my <code>${libdir}</code> is being change from the default <code>lib</code> to <code>lib64</code> because of the architecture <code>aarch64</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Solution is to either modify the python recipe, modify local.conf, or add softlink in a <code>ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND</code></span>
