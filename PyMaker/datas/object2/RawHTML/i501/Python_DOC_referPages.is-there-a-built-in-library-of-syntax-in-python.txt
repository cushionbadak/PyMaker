<p>I'm new to python and I was wondering if there was any way of pulling up a list of functions/symbols and their descriptions? I've tried <code>help()</code>, but that only shows a list of symbols, and only shows their descriptions if you know which one you're looking for. I'm trying to find a way of figuring out which function/symbol to use to solve a problem without the help of a browser.</p>

<p>The Python standard library is <em>massive</em>. You're going to have a bad time of it without the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python docs site</a>. Note that there is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/download.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">download link</a> so that you can have it locally; that can satisfy your "without a browser" problem, if you use the plain text version.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use this page as reference :</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html</a></p>
<p>Or try <code>pydoc</code> or <code>help()</code> or <code>dir()</code>.</p>
<p>For example in console search anything after help command like this :</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(max)

Help on built-in function max in module __builtin__:

max(...)
    max(iterable[, key=func]) -&gt; value
    max(a, b, c, ...[, key=func]) -&gt; value

    With a single iterable argument, return its largest item.
    With two or more arguments, return the largest argument.
(END)
</code></pre>
<p>Or like this for available modules:</p>
<pre><code>pydoc -k &lt;keyword&gt;
    Search for a keyword in the synopsis lines of all available modules.
</code></pre>
<p>for example :</p>
<pre><code>pydoc -k doc
