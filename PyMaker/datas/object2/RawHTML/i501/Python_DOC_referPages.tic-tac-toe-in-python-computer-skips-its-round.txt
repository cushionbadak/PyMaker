<p>im making a tic tac toe game where the computer has no ai, it just chooses a random position on the board and places the O letter in. i have made a function that checks if the space on the board is free. </p>
<p>for the player, if the space on the board is not free the player is asked to make another input until the space they choose is free. it works fine</p>
<p>however, if the computer chooses randomly a position that is filled, it just doesnt add anything and its the players turn without the comp making a move on a free space. </p>
<p>tl;dr: i want the compututer to make random inputs but verify the input is on an empty space, it doesn't do that, any help?</p>
<pre><code>def spacefree(board,pos): #checking if the space on board is free
    if board[pos] == ' ':
        return True
    else:
        return False

def playermove(board): #the function that checks if the players move is free that works
    pos=' '
    while pos not in '1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9'.split(",") or spacefree(board, int(pos)) is False:
        print('Enter your next move (1-9)')
        pos=input()
    return int(pos)

def computermove(board): #funtion that checks if the space onn the board is free for the computer that doesnt work
    pos = random.randint(0, 9)
    while spacefree(board, pos) is False:
        pos=random.randint(0, 9)
    return int(pos)

<p>One simple method: Use <strong>random.shuffe(range(9))</strong> instead of random.randint(0, 9)</p>
<p>random.shuffle() will give you a randomly ordered list</p>
<p>You can check the randomly generated position in list one by one.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How are you callig these functions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want to change your logic, you can precompute the free spaces and then then use <code>random.choice(list_of_free_spaces)</code>, however, I think the problem is the way you check for free space, do you initialize all the places of the grid at <code>' '</code> by default?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BlueSheepToken yes, i initialize all the places of the grid at ' ' at every start of the game. but the computer chooses  a position that has changed to 'X' but the same doesnt happen on the players turn. so doesnt that mean the computermove function is the one at fault?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Goyo i call them by the pos variable, as in pos  = computermove(board) should i edit the post with my code? i didnt want to jam in the entire program because it works fine with the exception of the computer, will do though if it helps</span>

<span class="comment-copy">but doesnt python 3 not return a list but an object? should i convert it to a list and then check the list one by one</span>

<span class="comment-copy">you can check doc at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/random.html</a> or try it out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">my answer about the usage of shuffle is not accurate. you should modify it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">didnt help thanks</span>
