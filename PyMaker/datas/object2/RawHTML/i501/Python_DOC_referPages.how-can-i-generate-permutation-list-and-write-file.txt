<p>I've write sentences and wanna combine it together, but in a permutation order.
Each sentence is stored in <code>outputa1.txt outputa2.txt outputa3.txt</code> and combined senteces will be stored in outputone.txt. </p>
<p>I've found out a permutation code </p>
<pre><code>a=itertools.permutations(["output()","output1()","output2()"],2)
b=str(random.choice(list(a)))
outfile.write(str(b))
</code></pre>
<p>I believe this code may help me complete the code.</p>
<p>But the problem is, because only output() is including <code>outfile=open("outputone.txt","w")</code> code, in def output1(), it cannot cognize the outputone. But if I add <code>outfile=open("outputone.txt","w")</code> to all the def, only one sentence came out, not combined. </p>
<p>If I remove def, I can make the code but I lose permutation order. </p>
<p>I know this code and my English skill is very sloppy because I've studied them alone without any books.</p>
<p>Please anyone to improve my python skills.. I would be really appreciate it!!</p>
<pre><code>def output() :          
     infile=open("file.txt","r")
     outfile=open("outputone.txt","w")

     line= open('outputa1.txt').readlines()
     line=''.join(line)
     outfile.write("\n")

def output1() :

     line= open('outputa2.txt').readlines()
     line=''.join(line)
     outfile.write(line)
     outfile.write("\n")

def output2() :

     line= open('outputa3.txt').readlines()
     line=''.join(line)
     outfile.write(line)
     outfile.write("\n")

     infile.close()
     outfile.close()

<p>the problem is at this line:</p>
<pre><code>outfile=open("outputone.txt","w")
</code></pre>
<p>you need to open this file in append mode: <code>outfile=open("outputone.txt","a")</code>
at function 'output' you miss <code>outfile.write(line)</code></p>
<p>for clarity i would wrote a helper function to append a file to another. when you are working with files with statement is the way to go, more info at: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement</a></p>
<pre><code>def append_to(source, output):
    with open(source, 'r') as source_file:
        rows = source_file.readlines()
        s = '\n'.join(rows)

    with open(output, 'a') as output_file:
        output_file.write(s)
