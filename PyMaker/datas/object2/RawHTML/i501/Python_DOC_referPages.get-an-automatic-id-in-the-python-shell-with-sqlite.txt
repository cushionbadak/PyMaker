<p>I need assistance with creating an automatic ID for the Employee's when the other information is inputted by the user, is anyone able to help? I don't want the Employee ID to be asked to be inputted by the user, I would like it to be automatically generated and inputted into that field. I also have to program it in python, I can't use a SQL program or anything. Feel free to change any parts of the code, it's pretty flimsy at the moment, I've been messing around with the 'rowid' code for a bit trying to get that to work and I can't figure it out, many thanks.</p>
