<p>I'm creating a little game where we can fight with characters. But, like in many game of fight turn per turn, I want create some action will occured a certain amout of time. For example, an action will change a stat for 3 turn or less/more. If someone can help me please.
                                                       Thank you</p>

<h2>Log of scheduled actions</h2>
<p>What you seem to need (causing an effect that will happen after a certain number of turns) is a log of scheduled actions.</p>
<p>One way to implement it is to keep a list of "active effects".</p>
<p>For a crude example,</p>
<pre><code># in the beginning
active_effects = []

# when the effect is caused
active_effects.append( { 'turn' : current_turn + 3, 'target' : 'player', 'damage' : 10 } )

# at the start of every turn
for effect in active_effects:
    if effect['turn'] == current_turn:
         apply_effect(effect)
</code></pre>
<p>(you might want to use a class instead and specify the effect as a function, but this should illustrate the general concept).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Turns aren't usually based on time so you might not need threading. This is too broad.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You cannot <code>add</code> to a list. You mean <code>append</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your answer, it answer at another question I haved. But I think I have not explain correctly my question. I want to an effect apply a certain amount of turn, for example, reduce by 5 the "defense" of a character for 3 turn.             Thank you to have answer at my question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your answer,  I managed to correct my problem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Exaye (and roganjosh) I updated the code sample to adjust for these things.</span>
