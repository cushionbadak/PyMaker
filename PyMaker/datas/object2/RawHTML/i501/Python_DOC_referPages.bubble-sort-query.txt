<p>I don't understand what is happening on line 2, with the "-1, 0 , -1". Why does it need to do this, and what does the zero represent?</p>
<p>I have run the code, when I removed the "-1, 0, -1" part and it didn't sort the list. I don't understand why it is such a crucial part of code</p>
<pre><code>def bubbleSort(alist):
    for passnum in range(len(alist)-1,0,-1): #line 2
        for i in range(passnum):
            if alist[i]&gt;alist[i+1]:
                temp = alist[i]
                alist[i] = alist[i+1]
                alist[i+1] = temp

alist = [54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20]
bubbleSort(alist)
print(alist)

<p>That has nothing to do with the algorithm. <code>range</code> has 3 arguments</p>
<ul>
<li>from</li>
<li>to</li>
<li>step</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, this means</p>
<ul>
<li>start from the last element (index=N-1)</li>
<li>continue until the second (index=0)</li>
<li>step=-1 (to go backwards)</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are arguments to <code>range(start, stop, sep)</code>  (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range</a>)
In your case you create a range that starts with the length of your list -1 (<code>len(alist)-1</code>), and count to 0, by taking steps of -1.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As comments suggest, if you'd googled the docs for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>range</code></a>, you might have worked things out. Your line:</p>
<pre><code>range(len(alist)-1,0,-1)
</code></pre>
<p>Means the range starts at the <strong>end</strong> of the list (which is the length, minus 1, since lists are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering" rel="nofollow noreferrer">0 indexed</a>), and ends at <strong>1</strong> (one before 0), with steps of <strong>-1</strong> (backwards).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It may be helpful to refer to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation for <code>range</code></a> to determine the meaning of its second and third arguments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did, but I don't understand it properly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Imagine len(alist)=5. It set <code>passnum</code> to 4, 3, 2 and 1. Zero is ignored.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not penultimate</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Starts from the <i>last</i> element, and stops <i>before</i> the one at index 0.</span>
