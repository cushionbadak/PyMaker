<p>I am doing the same problem listed <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mOklN.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> but in python 3 and not getting the exact expected results so my main formula is off. I tried few things but when I do it creates a ValueError math domain error depending if I use parenthesis are certain parts of the equation.I tried looking at the other thread that had same problem but no luck. Thanks in advance!!!</p>
<p>This one. num_of_months = (-1/30) * (math.log(1 + ((balance/monnthly_payment)) * (1 - ((1 + daily_rate)**30)))
            /math.log(1 + daily_rate));</p>

<p>the error and wrong calc was caused by your formula   </p>
<p>APR should be <code>float</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>apr = int(math.ceil(float(input("What is the APR on the card (as a

<p>So if you input <code>0.12</code> and cast <code>int</code> and <code>math.ceil()</code> it will return <code>1</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reference</a></p>
<p>I splitted the calculation for a better overview :)</p>
<p><em>Tipp: split your calc for overview and test with a fixed input of numbers before consider a user input.</em></p>

<span class="comment-copy">i see a semicolon in your code :D thats normaly not a good sign.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"daily_rate = apr / 100 / 365 # added as percentage " just realized I didn't do this part right since its a percentage and forgot to divide 100. Thanks</span>
