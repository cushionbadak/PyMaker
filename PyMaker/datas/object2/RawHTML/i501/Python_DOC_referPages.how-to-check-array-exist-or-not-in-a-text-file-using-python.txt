<p>Here is my code:</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re</a> this get's what you're looking for done plain and simple.</p>

<p>Also fixed your opens. You need to close them unless you use <code>with open(...) as ...:</code> as a context manager to automatically close the file upon completion.</p>
<p>Also, you do know you're just going to have a bunch of <code>1</code>'s in your result file right? You're probably going to want some sort of delimiter...</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It seems (though it isn't entirely clear) that you want to know when a line in the file contains any of the values in <code>["T6", "J6", "K6", "N6"]</code>. </p>
<p>Change your <code>if</code> test to</p>
<pre><code>if any(f in line for f in Fixed):

<span class="comment-copy">Have a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4940032/how-to-search-for-a-string-in-text-files">this answer</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">"Need Help ASAP please"... This isn't going to get your answers quicker. See <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/326569/under-what-circumstances-may-i-add-urgent-or-other-similar-phrases-to-my-quest">here</a> Looks like you need to spend more time learning the language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow Its working. But everytime I execute, It always overwrite the result. How do I remove the previous result? Help me pleae</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edited as per your other comment, and to make it overwrite the other file, you'd need to open the file using <code>'w'</code> <i>write</i> not <code>'a'</code> <i>append</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It still give me the same result. The previous result is not rewrite with the next result if I excecute it. So, if I excecute 3 times, It gives me result like this : 111</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>'w'</code> not <code>'a'</code> I edited</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you looking to write a 1 if the entire file contains one of the items in fixed? and a 0 if not?</span>
