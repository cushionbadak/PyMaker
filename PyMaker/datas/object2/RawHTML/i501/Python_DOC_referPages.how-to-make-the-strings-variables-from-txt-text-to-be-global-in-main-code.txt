<p>I'm trying to make Login/Register system. The only problem is now, How could I access the Variables and String globally in Main code? I know that defining them, is not very good idea. But i have tried to do that, and I do get error with variable, when i did this:</p>
<pre><code>def Ballance(Ballance):
    global Ballance
    Ballance = 0.00
    return Ballance
</code></pre>
<p>And tried to use here:</p>
<pre><code>print(" Ballance {} psw {} Your Ballance {} EUR ".format(Vardas, Password, Ballance))
</code></pre>
<p>I do get this in the terminal.</p>
<pre><code>Ballance Jut psw jut Your Ballance &lt;function Ballance at 0x7f6f0662bc80&gt; EUR 
</code></pre>
<p>My whole Code:</p>
<pre><code># Text File.

<p>My question would be how to use these functions as global, that I can use them without the defining?
<strong>Password</strong>, <strong>Username</strong>, <strong>Ballance</strong>, <strong>Regtime</strong>, <strong>Role</strong>, <strong>Ban</strong>.</p>

<p>You are trying to declare global variables with the same name as your functions. This is why you get the output <code>&lt;function Ballance at 0x7f6f0662bc80&gt;</code> - you are printing the function called <code>Ballance</code>.</p>
<p>You need to rename the global variables to something else, or better yet, use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">class</a> to collect the functions as methods, with attributes instead of global variables. You could try something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self._balance = 0.00
        ...  # more attributes

    def get_balance(self):
        return self._balance

    ...  # more methods
</code></pre>
<p>You would use this class like this:</p>
<pre><code>my_bank_account = BankAccount()

...

print("Your balance is {} EUR.".format(my_bank_account.get_balance()))
</code></pre>
<p>You can add the code to initialise the attributes in the <code>__init__</code> method (either with a default value like <code>0.00</code>, or by prompting the user with <code>input()</code>). Then as well as <code>get_</code> methods, you can add methods to mutate the state, like this:</p>
<pre><code>class BankAccount:
    ...
    def increase_balance(self, amount):
        self._balance += amount

    def decrease_balance(self, amount):
        self._balance -= amount
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>It sounds like you would benefit a lot from a good tutorial on Python classes, or about object-oriented programming in general. You should make sure you understand what <code>self</code> and the <code>__init__</code> method do above.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can't have a variable with the same name as a function. Rename one of them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean same name as a function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have <code>def Ballance</code>, that defines a function named <code>Ballance</code>. Then you do <code>global Ballance</code>, that refers to a global variable with that name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How could I for example edit them, from other functions. When I have the data in the txt file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Stop using global variables in your functions. Just return the value, and have the caller assign to a variable there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When i did this class, and used Bank as a variable I Do get this in Terminal: Ballance Jut psw jut Your Ballance &lt;class '<b>main</b>.Bank'&gt; EUR</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JamesSmith it sounds like you are printing the class instead of the result of the <code>get_balance</code> method. See update about using the class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that's working. How to use this method with another variables and strings? Same method?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also How could i add, minus to the balance? Which Do I need to use? my_balance or my_bank_account?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But, wait why there's  self._balance = 0.00 ? I just need to set the ballance to new account to zero.</span>
