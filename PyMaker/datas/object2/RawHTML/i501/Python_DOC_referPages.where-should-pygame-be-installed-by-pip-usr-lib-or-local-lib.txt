<p>I was testing CARLA, a self-driving car simulator on ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS last year and at that time, I had installed pygame. At that time pygame had been installed under /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pygame and I had fixed a file there to make it work right.
Now, recently I re-installed ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS for the machine (only the OS part) and tried testing CARLA and found I have to install pygame(which is of course). So I did <code>pip install pygame</code>(without sudo) and CARLA now works again.<br/>
But soon I found the location of pygame installation is now not /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/pygame but  ~/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pygame.<br/>
Why is it installed in my local home directory, not in the system directory? (I tried installing it with sudo, but it says Requirement alread satisfied.)<br/>
I tried <code>python -m pip uninstall pip</code> but received message below. </p>
<pre><code> Not uninstalling pip at /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages, outside environment /usr
You are using pip version 8.1.1, however version 19.0.2 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
</code></pre>
<p>should I do <code>pip upgrade</code>?<br/>
ADD : This question is not about 'sudo' or 'apt install'. Normally in <code>apt install</code>, if we omit <code>sudo</code>, it asks for root priviledge and doesn't install it. But pip installs it under ~/.local. Therefore this question is different from suggested duplicate question.</p>

<p>First, <code>python -m pip uninstall pip</code> is meant to uninstall pip, not <code>pygame</code>, so you <em>wouldn't</em> want to do that.</p>
<p>When invoked with <code>sudo</code>, pip will install the libraries system-wide on <code>/usr/lib</code>, so they're accessible by all users. </p>
<p>When called <em>without sudo</em> and/or with a <code>--user</code> flag, they're installed for your user only on your home directory. In either case, <code>pip</code> reports the library as already installed, and doesn't need to re-install it. Take a look at the link provided by triplee, as well as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33412974/how-to-uninstall-a-package-installed-with-pip-install-user">here</a></p>
<p>You can use the following, to verify that Python looks at both of these paths to find available libraries.</p>
<pre><code>import sys
print(sys.path)
</code></pre>
<p>To address your point, <em>both of these locations are fine</em>, it just a matter of preference.</p>
<p>If you want to uninstall <code>pygame</code> from <code>~/.local</code> you should try <code>pip uninstall pygame</code>, and then use <code>sudo pip install pygame</code> again, to have a system-wide, static version installation.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it's better to have user dependencies gathered locally, so that each user is free to install/remove/update libraries and modules to his requirements, and preferably inside his <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Virtual Environment</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@hyperTrashPanda  yes, thanks! (I was busy after selecting your choice and checking it's correct).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, Thanks!. Correct. I didn't know for pip, if we omit 'sudo' it installs under ~/.local. Usually, when we use install using <code>apt install</code>, it asks for root priviledge and doesn't install, which is different from pip behavior. That's what I was not aware of.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Glad your question was answered!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">now I uninstalled pygame in ~/.local and then I installed it with <code>sudo</code> and it's now installed in /usr/local.</span>
