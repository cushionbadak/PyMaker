<p>I have a class with only class methods. Is it a Pythonic way of namespacing? If not, what is the best way to group similar kinds of methods?.</p>
<pre><code>class OnlyClassMethods(object):
    @classmethod
    def method_1(cls):

    @classmethod

<p>A class is meant to have instances, not to serve as namespace. If your class is never instantiated, it does not serve the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33072570/when-should-i-be-using-classes-in-python">intended purpose of Python's <code>class</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you want to namespace a group of methods which are related, create a new <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">module</a>, that is another <code>.py</code> file, and import it.</p>
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>Here we create a module names <code>helpers</code> which contains some related methods. This module can then be imported in our <code>main</code> file.</p>
<h3>helpers.py</h3>
<pre><code>def method_1():
    ...

def method_2():
    ...
</code></pre>
<h3>main.py</h3>
<pre><code>import helpers

helpers.method_1()
helpers.method_2()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">As of now this question is too broad as the context is missing. For example, if there is no  shared state between these methods then it may make more sense to "namespace" by using top-level functions</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The question is not very precise. Why would you use only classmethods ? If you're trying to generate a class through a class, I encourage you to take a look in <code>meta classes</code> : <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-are-metaclasses-in-python" title="what are metaclasses in python">stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace If you're using only classmethods, then all what you care about is to modify the instance methods or class attributes. I had a similar problem where I needed to generate different classes according to different parameters, and a (bad) way of doing this is to first generate an instance, then use classmethods to replace some behaviours. Anyway, I infered this is the usecase of OP, although I am not sure, that's why I begin my comment with "the question is not very precise".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Really answered my question. Thanks</span>
