<p>when I activate my virtual environment and install packages that I need, when I close the command prompt or turn off the computer do I need to install packages again?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>No you don't need to install it again if you restart your machine.</p>
<p>You need to reinstall again only it you destroy your virtual image and recreate it. If your have such scenario 
I will suggest to use configure tools like Chef which can automated to install all your setups once you recreate your image. </p>

<p>You don't need to re-install packages each time but you'll need to re-active the environment when you open a new prompt or turn your computer back on. </p>
<p>The Python Virtual Environment <a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> covers how to activate and de-activate virtual environments. </p>

<p>If you talk about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">venv</a> the answer is No. The packages you have installed in a specific venv are persisted to disk.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">By destroying, you mean completely deleting the folder?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Destroying is generic term I used with VM. Destroying VM depends on VM implementation you are using Eg vagrant which does not destroy VM even if you delete it's state folder and keeps process running.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!! I understand now.</span>
