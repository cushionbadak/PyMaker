<p>I'm writing a python script to convert <code>.DBC</code> files into <code>.CSV</code>.</p>
<p>I've searched a lot some libs to help me but didn't get success with any of them. Do someone know an option/package which could be useful in this conversion task?</p>

<p>I don't know of anything that does an actual conversion, but assuming you mean the DBC BUS format, there's a Python library to read that: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cantools/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pypi.org/project/cantools/</a></p>
<p>And Python has built-in tools for writing CSVs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a></p>
<p>It should take only a handful of lines to combine those libraries into a converter.</p>

<p>Convert it to XLS (microsoft excel) and from there you can get it to .csv, I am ubuntu guy but I believe there should be a export option. or at least there is in LibreOffice</p>
