<p>Learning Python, increasingly frustrated with it's documentation.</p>
<p>For the following script:</p>
<pre><code>utf_string = "文言"

raw_bytes = b'\xe6\x96\x87\xe8\xa8\x80'

print(raw_bytes.decode())

print(utf_string.encode())

print(raw_bytes == utf_string.encode())

print(utf_string == raw_bytes.decode())
</code></pre>
<p>1) Where is the documentation for these encode() and decode() methods?</p>
<p>2) I've tested for the data type of the variables using print(type(utf_string)) and realise that I am working with both strings and bytes.</p>
<p>3) How do I approach finding out which class these methods belong to? I've tried searching Google for 'Python 3 string methods' and 'Python decode method' with no joy. </p>
<p>I need to know an approach so I can find out the class the method belongs to, then easily find the documentation for this. Otherwise I don't really know how to use the method.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your variable <code>raw_bytes</code> is not a string, it is of type <code>bytes</code>. That is what the <code>b</code> prefix means. <code>decode</code> is a method of <code>bytes</code> objects and the default encoding is UTF-8 but you can specify other encodings.</p>
<p>Your variable <code>utf_string</code> is a string. <code>encode</code> is a string method. The default encoding is UTF-8 but you can specify other encodings. </p>
<p>Together these two methods, as you have discovered, enable back-and-forth translation between <code>bytes</code>, which is  immutable like a string, but is a sequence of small integers, and strings, which represent Unicode codepoints. Both methods are documented at in the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">standard library docs</a>.  </p>
<p>The Python Standard Library has, in general, exemplary documentation, and that documentation should be your first port of call when you have a question like this.</p>

<li><p>Documentation for both can be found <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. Search for 'bytes.decode' and 'str.encode'.</p></li>

<span class="comment-copy">First Google hit for "Python 3 string methods" for me was "Built-in Types — Python 3.7.2 documentation (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html</a>), which has sections for classes <code>str</code> (of which <code>encode()</code> is a method) and <code>bytes</code> (of which <code>decode()</code> is a method).  You could have determined these types via <code>print(type(raw_bytes))</code> for example.</span>
