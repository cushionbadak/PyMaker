<p>I tried to make any combination of hebrew letters using ocde I found online, but this was the result:
i couldn't print the hebrew comnation right, and I think its an encoding trouble..
using python 2.7.15
CODE:</p>
<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
your_list = 'אבגדהוזחטיכלמנסעפצקרשת '
complete_list = []
max_length = 2
a = []
print 'Starting find combinations for', max_length, 'letters, with the         chars"'+your_list+'"'
for current in xrange(max_length):
a = [i for i in your_list]
for y in xrange(current):
    a = [x+i for i in your_list for x in a];
complete_list = complete_list + a
for x in complete_list:
    print x.decode("utf-8")
</code></pre>
<p>and the console reult:</p>
<pre><code>    Starting find combinations for 2 letters, with the chars"אבגדהוזחטיכלמנסעפצקרשת "

<span class="comment-copy">1) Are you using Python 2.7? 2) The indention of your code is broken.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">done, changed to python27</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but I want to make combination for 1 and then 2 and then 3 and so on up to 24... also not using python3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What exactly do you want to do? And is there any reason for not using Python 3?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"like" brute force, for educational purposes - also explains why using 27.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why does education require Python 2.7?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because years ago the teacher have been trained and since then python 3 released and there are no resources or something... terribly stupid but I can do nothing about.</span>
