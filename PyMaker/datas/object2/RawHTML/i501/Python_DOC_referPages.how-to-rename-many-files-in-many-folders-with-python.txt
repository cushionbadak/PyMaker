<p>i'm trying to erase all indexes (characters) except the last 4 ones and the files' extension in python. for example: 
a2b-0001.tif to 0001.tif 
a3tcd-0002.tif to 0002.tif 
as54d-0003.tif to 0003.tif</p>
<p>Lets say that folders "a", "b" and "c" which contains those tifs files are located in D:\photos</p>
<ul>
<li>there many of those files in many folders in D:\photos </li>
</ul>
<p>that's where i got so far:</p>
<pre><code>import os

os.chdir('C:/photos')

for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk('C:/photos'):

os.rename (filenames, filenames[-8:])
</code></pre>
<p>why that' not working?</p>

<p>So long as you have Python 3.4+, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pathlib</code></a> makes it extremely simple to do:</p>
<pre><code>import pathlib

def rename_files(path):
    ## Iterate through children of the given path
    for child in path.iterdir():
        ## If the child is a file
        if child.is_file():
            ## .stem is the filename (minus the extension)
            ## .suffix is the extension
            name,ext = child.stem, child.suffix
            ## Rename file by taking only the last 4 digits of the name
            child.rename(name[-4:]+ext)

directory = pathlib.Path(r"C:\photos").resolve()
## Iterate through your initial folder
for child in directory.iterdir():
    ## If the child is a folder
    if child.is_dir():
        ## Rename all files within that folder
        rename_files(child)
</code></pre>
<p>Just note that because you're truncating file names, there may be collisions which may result in files being overwritten (i.e.- files named <code>12345.jpg</code> and <code>22345.jpg</code> will both be renamed to <code>2345.jpg</code>, with the second overwriting the first).</p>
