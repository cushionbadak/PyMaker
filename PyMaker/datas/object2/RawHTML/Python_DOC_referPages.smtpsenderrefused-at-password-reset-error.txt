<p>How can I solve this problem?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('mymail@gmail.com')</p>
<p>EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('generatedpassword')</p>

<p>I have generated google app password and put both email and pass on the correct field, still I got this error. Is there any steps to follow?</p>

<p>Do you actually have environment variables set for <code>EMAIL_HOST_USER</code> and <code>EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD</code>? <code>os.environ.get</code> takes a key corresponding to a system environment variable as the argument, and will return <code>None</code> by default if an environment variable matching that key cannot be found.</p>
<p>What is happening right now is it's looking for an environment variable called <code>mymail@gmail.com</code>, and because that likely does not exist, it returns <code>None</code> and causes the error you're experiencing.</p>
<p>You should set up an environment variable <code>EMAIL_HOST_USER</code> with a <strong>value</strong> of <code>mymail@gmail.com</code>, and another with the key being <code>EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD</code> with value <code>generatedpassword</code> for what you are doing to work.</p>
<p>Note that you can call them something else if you prefer, the name does not have to match the Django settings variable.</p>
