<p>In Python's time module, there is a <code>sleep()</code> function, where you can make Python wait x seconds before resuming the program. Is there a way to do this indefinitely until a condition is met? For example:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    time.sleep()
    if x:
        break

time.unsleep()
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to make a pause function for my PyGame program. Any help is appreciated. </p>

<p>Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>while not x: time.sleep(0.1)
</code></pre>
<p>will wait until <code>x</code> is true, sleeping a tenth of a second between checks. This is usually short enough for your script to seem to react instantly (in human terms) when <code>x</code> becomes true. You could use <code>0.01</code> instead if this is not quick enough. In my experience, today's computers are fast enough that checking a simple condition even every hundredth of a second doesn't really make a dent in CPU usage.</p>
<p>Of course, <code>x</code> should be something that can actually change, e.g. a function call.</p>

<p>Your code in the question implies that you want some other thread to resume your program. In that case you could use <a href="/library/threading.html#event-objects"><code>resumed = threading.Event()</code></a>. You could create it in one thread and pass it into another:</p>
<pre><code>while not resumed.wait(): # wait until resumed
    "continue waiting"
</code></pre>
<p>Call <code>resumed.set()</code> to resume this code immediately.</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/time.html" rel="nofollow"><code>pygame.time</code></a>. Typically, you have the main loop where you update the state of the game and at the end of the loop you call <code>clock.tick(60) # 60 fps</code>. It is enough to use <code>paused</code> flag in this case, to skip the updating.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Does the thread <i>have</i> to sleep? From what it looks like, it doesn't have to - an infinite loop until the condition is met should suffice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One way to pause (better than the type you would get from <code>sleep()</code>) is by setting a flag (<code>paused = True</code>) and not updating the gameâ€™s state <code>if paused</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Zizou212 that would cause the game to use 100% CPU while paused, which is rude (makes the computer slow and hot, uses electricity, and drains the battery - all for no reason). At least include a short sleep in the loop then.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">A variation would be <code>forever = threading.Event(); forever.wait()</code>. This would be useful for a process whose only purpose is to handle interrupts (by setting handlers via <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>signal</code></a>).
