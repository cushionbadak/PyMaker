<p>I am looking to find if a set contains any value other than that contained in another set.</p>
<p>At the moment i have the code:</p>
<pre><code> set_entered = set(["ok_word_1", "ok_word_2", "not_ok_word"])
 set_allowable = set(["ok_word_1", "ok_word_2","ok_word_3", "ok_word_4"])

 set_entered_temp = set(set_entered)
 for item in set_allowable :
    set_1_temp.discard(item)
 if len(set_entered_temp ) &gt; 0:
     print ("additional terms")
 else:
    print ("no additional terms")
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a simpler way of doing this? It is obviously trivially easy to see if a set contains an element [e.g. union of sets], but couldn't see an obvious way of seeing whether a set contained an element other than that in a set.</p>
<p>Update</p>
<p>Just to clarify, I am only looking to see if there is a term in the <code>entered set</code> which does not appear in the <code>allowable</code> set. [i.e am not looking to see if there is a difference between the two sets, rather just whether there are values in the entered set which are not in the other one].</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set.difference" rel="nofollow">substract</a> the two sets:</p>
<pre><code>if set_1 - set_2:
    print("Additional terms")
</code></pre>
<p>Every element in <code>set_2</code> will be removed from <code>set_1</code>. If the resulted set is not empty, this means there was at least one value in <code>set_1</code> not contained into <code>set_2</code>.</p>
<p>Note that an empty set is interpreted as <code>False</code>, this is why this <code>if</code> condition works.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That's what <code>set.difference()</code> is for</span>
<span class="comment-copy">After your update: that is still what <code>set.difference</code> is for: <code>{1,2}.difference({2,3}) -&gt; {1}</code> it doesn't worry about things that are contained in the second set but not the first.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might be thinking of <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#set.symmetric_difference" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>set.symmetric_difference</code></a>: <code>{1,2}.symmetric_difference({2,3}) -&gt; {1,3}</code></span>
