<p>I have the following regular expression to extract song names from a certain website:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h2 class="chart-row__song"&gt;(.*?)&lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It displays the results below :   </p>
<p>Where <code>&amp;#039;</code> is in the output below, is an <strong>apostrophe</strong> on the website the song name is extract from.    </p>
<p>How would I go about changing my regular expression to remove those characters?     <code>&amp;#039;</code></p>

<p>As stated in the comments, you can't do that using a regex alone. You need to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.unescape" rel="nofollow">unescape the HTML entities</a> present in the match separately.</p>
<pre><code>import re
import html
regex = re.compile(r'&lt;h2 class="chart-row__song"&gt;(.*?)&lt;/h2&gt;')
result = [html.unescape(s) for s in regex.findall(mystring)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@ghoti The line starting with &lt;h2&gt; is the code 'regular expression'...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Firstly, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags">don't parse HTML with regular expressions</a>. Secondly, a regex is not suited to this task. Those things are called HTML entities, do a search on them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That doesn't look like python to me.  A regular expression is used to MATCH content, not alter it (like removing strings from it). You've tagged your queston <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python">python</a>, so please include your attempt to achieve this in python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ghoti it's not really far to expect a beginner to understand what's going on here. They could do a simple string replace and it would work but be a poor solution.</span>
