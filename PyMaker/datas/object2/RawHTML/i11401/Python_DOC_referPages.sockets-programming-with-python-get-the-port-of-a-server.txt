<p>So as the title suggests is there any way that I can get the port of a website/ip with a socket connection? I assigned <code>socket.gethostbyname()</code> to the simple variable "ip" so that I can print out the result in console but can I do the same with the port? Here is the website that I am using to learn with &gt; <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html</a> &lt; and what I am wondering is if this is a good source or does anyone know a better one? Thank you much :D</p>

<p>You can get the currently used port with <code>getsockname</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.bind(('0.0.0.0', 0))
print('listening on port:', sock.getsockname()[1])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It is common to use predefined port numbers. The standard ones can be looked up (example, http is port 80)</span>
