<p>How can I view log messages on Google Cloud?: <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/logs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://console.cloud.google.com/logs</a> </p>
<p>This is what I see in the terminal when I run dev_appserver.py (locally running):</p>
<pre><code>INFO     2016-05-16 14:00:45,118 module.py:787] default: "GET /static/images/contact.png HTTP/1.1" 304 -

</code></pre>
<p>Both application log messages and request logging is displayed.<br/>
However when I view the log of the same code deployed I can only see the requests being logged:  </p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vIQv2.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="gcloud-log" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vIQv2.png"/></a></p>
<p>The code I'm using to generate application log messages is something like:</p>
<pre><code>import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("someLogger")

logger.info("entering app.py")
</code></pre>
<p>But I've also tried using <code>logging.info(...)</code> directly with the same results.</p>
<p>I've tried finding an answer to this in various resources but I've come up empty-handed, most refer to how to set log level when developing locally.<br/>
I'm guessing that I need to enable some setting in order to view application logs on Google Cloud Logs.</p>

<p>App engine groups the logs by request. You need to expand the log using the triangle/pointer on the left of the request in the 'new' GAE log viewer.</p>
<p>Personally I prefer using the old GAE log viewer, but I am unsure how much longer it will be around:</p>
<p><a href="https://appengine.google.com/logs?app_id=s~xxx" rel="nofollow">https://appengine.google.com/logs?app_id=s~xxx</a></p>
<p>(This viewer shows request + logs and allows log expansion)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried your suggestion, unfortunately this doesn't help as the application log messages I'm looking for are simply missing (somehow being filtered out) from the log viewer.   Expanding the log entries that I can access do not help me find the missing application log messages that I'm looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am experiencing a similar issue, sometimes they are included but the majority of the time they are missing from the payload</span>
