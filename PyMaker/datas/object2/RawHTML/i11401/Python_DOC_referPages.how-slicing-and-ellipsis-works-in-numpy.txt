<p>I have been reading a very old documentation of <strong>Numpy</strong> and found out a weird notation which eludes my understanding. The documentation says <code>a[i:...]</code> is a shortcut for <code>a[i,:,:,:]</code>. </p>
<p>The documentation being old is very vague and I would welcome any comments. </p>
<p>Thanks,
Prerit</p>

<p><code>arr[:,:,1]</code> is fancy indexing used by numpy that selects the first element of the last column in <code>arr</code>. Fancy indexing can only be used in numpy arrays and not in python's traditional lists.
Also, like its pointed out in the comments, <code>a[,:,:,]</code> is a syntax error.</p>
<p>It is helpful because you can select columns easily</p>

<p>Three full stops <code>...</code> (and not <code>â€¦</code> (U+2026)), refers to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#the-ellipsis-object" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ellipsis</a> singleton object. It has no built-in special operations but is often used in slicing expressions.</p>
<p>No built-in classes utilise the Ellipsis object however NumPy uses <code>...</code> as a shortcut when slicing arrays, for example, where <code>x</code> is a 4D array: <code>x[i, ...]</code> is equivalant to <code>x[i, :, :, :]</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your question is undoubtedly more vague than the documentation.I'd look at the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/arrays.indexing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">actual documentation</a> though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">wait, what? I was looking at wrong documentation? LOL</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>a[,:,:,]</code> is a syntax error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you explain me how this indexing/splicing is working, I am not getting a hold of the concept.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why don't you create an array for yourself and test what it does?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks John! I edited my question, I think I shouldn't have given the example of a[,:,:,] which is clearly wrong, I gave it naively. But my main question is how does ellipses work during indexing. Thanks for answering it John, I appreciate it, Everyone else is focused on pointing my error rather than answering my question.</span>
