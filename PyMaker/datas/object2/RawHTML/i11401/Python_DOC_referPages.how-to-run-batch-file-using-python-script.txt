<p>Is this possible? I yes, can anyone help me how to do it. I don't know how to use  <code>subprocess</code> and <code>Popen()</code> to run my <code>sort.bat</code> file.</p>

<p>You can use <code>os.system</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.system('Path to your .bat file')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you read <code>subprocess</code>'s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> to understand how it works?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace I tried reading it but I'm still confused on how to apply it to run a batch file/process. But it's okay now. I tried the code from Farhan's answer. But if you have a more comprehensive explanation of the <code>subprocess</code> and <code>Popen()</code> codes than the documentation, I would be glad to hear from you. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It works! thanks!</span>
