    Examples:

        '[(3, 2, 1), 'cba']

<p>This is a python function, which is to flip each element entered, backward. I have learned indexing, but to_flip[counter] is like nothing I seen. What purpose does to_flip[counter] serve, in flipping each element? Does it have a name for this? And doesn't counter serve to add each number given, and to come out with a sum? Why is it needed here? And are there any other ways of doing reverse like this, for a beginner. Thank you.</p>

<p>The <code>to_flip</code> line is flipping whatever is in that element. For example if you ran it on just one list:</p>
<pre><code>my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
flipped_list = my_list[::-1]
</code></pre>
<p><code>flipped_list</code> would now be <code>[5,4,3,2,1]</code>. The <code>[::-1]</code> is a neat little shorthand for flipping any list. </p>
<p>For your code, <code>counter</code> is keeping track of what element you are in in <code>to_flip</code>. You could also keep track by using <code>enumerate</code>, which keeps count of what element you are at, on the list too:</p>
<pre><code>for i, value in enumerate(to_flip):
    to_flip[i] = value[::-1]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>to_flip[counter]</code>  accesses an item of the list <code>to_flip</code> at position <code>counter</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>flip_keys([(1, 2, 3), 'abc', 1, 3])</code> expected to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And do you expect to get input like <code>flip_keys([(1, 2, 3), 'abc', [1, [[2]]]])</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ Tigerhawk, I understand it better now, you get an error from flip_keys([(1, 2, 3), 'abc', 1, 3]), for only elements in groupings are reversed. Maybe that's why you use the counter as the position in this case. Thank you.</span>
