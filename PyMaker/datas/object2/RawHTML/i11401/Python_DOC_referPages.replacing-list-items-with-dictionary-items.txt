<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Does anyone know what I should be doing here? I'm new to python so I'm not quite sure how to describe it. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Its sort of like a simple encrypter program.</p>
<p>I have a list (below), and a dictionary. </p>
<pre><code>list = ['a','b','a','c','d','b']
dictionary = ('a':1,'b':2,'c':3,'d':4)
</code></pre>
<p>And I want this output:</p>
<pre><code>121342
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>list_t = ['a','b','a','c','d','b']
dictionary = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3,'d':4}
lis=[]
for i in list_t:
   for key in dictionary:
      if (i==key):
         lis.append(dictionary[i])
print lis
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try this</p>
<pre><code>list = ['a','b','a','c','d','b']
dictionary = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3,'d':4}    
[dictionary[i] for i in list]
</code></pre>
<p>this expression will make new list by iterating on "list" variable and get "dictionary[i]" using "i" as every item in "list". Reed more <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">here</a> about.</p>
<p>if you are not sure your "dictionary" have every value from "list" better to get "dictionary" values with "dictionary.get(i,'value if key is not found')". Then you can type:</p>
<pre><code>[dictionary.get(i,'value if key is not found') for i in list]
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict" rel="nofollow">here</a> you will get more about that</p>
<p>las one - if your result should be exact '121342', take a look <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow">here</a> then type</p>
<pre><code>''.join([dictionary.get(i,'value if key is not found') for i in list])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You have a list and a syntax error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DonkeyKong that's the thing - I don't know where to start really. I was messing around with Python and I sorta dug myself into a hole I'm too inexperienced to dig my way out of.</span>
