<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have data which is being accessed via http request and is sent back by the server in a comma separated format, I have the following code :</p>
<pre><code>site= 'www.example.com'
hdr = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}
req = urllib2.Request(site,headers=hdr)
page = urllib2.urlopen(req)
soup = BeautifulSoup(page)
soup = soup.get_text()
text=str(soup)
</code></pre>
<p>The content of text is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>april,2,5,7
may,3,5,8
june,4,7,3
july,5,6,9
</code></pre>
<p>How can I save this data into a CSV file.
I know I can do something along the lines of the following to iterate line by line:</p>
<pre><code>import StringIO
s = StringIO.StringIO(text)
for line in s:
</code></pre>
<p>But i'm unsure how to now properly write each line to CSV</p>
<p>EDIT---&gt; Thanks for the feedback as suggested the solution was rather simple and can be seen below.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<pre><code>import StringIO
s = StringIO.StringIO(text)
with open('fileName.csv', 'w') as f:
    for line in s:
        f.write(line)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>General way:</p>
<pre><code>##text=List of strings to be written to file
with open('csvfile.csv','wb') as file:
    for line in text:
        file.write(line)
        file.write('\n')
</code></pre>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Using CSV writer :</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open(&lt;path to output_csv&gt;, "wb") as csv_file:
        writer = csv.writer(csv_file, delimiter=',')
        for line in data:
            writer.writerow(line)
</code></pre>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Simplest way:</p>
<pre><code>f = open('csvfile.csv','w')
f.write('hi there\n') #Give your csv text here.
## Python will convert \n to os.linesep
f.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could just write to the file as you would write any normal file.</p>
<pre><code>with open('csvfile.csv','wb') as file:
    for l in text:
        file.write(l)
        file.write('\n')
</code></pre>
<p>If just in case, it is a list of lists, you could directly use built-in <code>csv</code> module</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open("csvfile.csv", "wb") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(text)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would simply write each line to a file, since it's already in a CSV format:</p>
<pre><code>write_file = "output.csv"
with open(write_file, "w") as output:
    for line in text:
        output.write(line + '\n')
</code></pre>
<p>I can't recall how to write lines with line-breaks at the moment, though :p</p>
<p>Also, you might like to take a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/12377575/1091386">this answer</a> about <code>write()</code>, <code>writelines()</code>, and <code>'\n'</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What about this:</p>
<pre><code>with open("your_csv_file.csv", "w") as f:
    f.write("\n".join(text))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.join()</a> Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable.
  The separator between elements is
  the string providing this method.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's already a CSV, you just have to write each line to a file...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure you even need the <code>StringIO</code> import, to be honest. Also, the solution as-is probably does not separate the lines, as <code>f.write()</code> does not append newlines automatically.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@icedwater I understand what your saying, but I ran the code above and it was able to properly store the data to a csv file.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">for python 3, change it to <code>with open(&lt;path to output_csv&gt;, "w", newline='') as csv_file:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Missing information on this line <code>for line in data:</code>. Please fix that. Thank you.</span>
