<p>I am being unable to run my code as soon as I add these send line in client and recv line in the server. I don't know what's wrong. Without them, the program is running perfectly. I am pasting just the smallest possible code for the ease of debugging because without these lines, code is perfect.</p>
<p>Client.py</p>
<pre><code>    print ('Opening file for editting.....')
with open('C:\\Users\\dell\\Desktop\\received_file.txt', 'ab') as e:
    e.write('Ya Allah tera shukar')
e.close()
print ('Editting Done!!!')
s.send("Trial Message")
s.close()
print ("Connection closed")
</code></pre>
<p>Server.py</p>
<pre><code>while (l): #Keep sending it until EOF id found
    conn.send(l) #Keep sending the opened file
    print(repr(l)) #repr(1) gives the string representation of contents of the file. The repr() of a string adds string quotes and backslashes:
    l = f.read(1024) #Keep reading the opened file so the contents appear on the server too
f.close()
print('Done sending the file')
print conn.recv(1024) #This is not receiving the trial message sent by client
conn.send('Thank you for connecting')
conn.close()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">How did you defined "s" in the client.py?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suspect you are trying to use string as an argument of byte-accepting method.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No by mistake I attached the wrong code. Check this edited one. In the client when I write s.send("any message"). How do I receive it on server side and display it. I am trying to send basically the link of a file from client to server. Receiving it via the line conn.recv(1024) is causing my program to get stuck :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'll be so grateful if you just guide me through this sending and receiving procedure between c&amp;s. I want to send a full path for a file to server.</span>
