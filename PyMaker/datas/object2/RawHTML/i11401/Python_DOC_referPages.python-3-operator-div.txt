<p>I have a slight problem with randomly generated operators in Python 3.</p>
<pre><code>import operator
hardOperators = [operator.add, operator.sub, operator.mul]
random_hardOperator = random.choice(hardOperators)
</code></pre>
<p>So you see, I have the operator functions <code>add</code>, <code>sub</code> and <code>mul</code>.
But when I try and add the <code>div</code> operator I get an alert saying that <code>operator has no attribute 'div'</code>.</p>
<p>I've never actually tried using random operators in Python before, so this might sound a foolish question, but it's one which is giving me hell in debugging.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is no <code>operator.div</code> in Python 3, no; that only existed in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/operator.html#operator.div" rel="noreferrer">Python 2</a>.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.truediv" rel="noreferrer"><code>operator.truediv()</code> function</a> instead, as well as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.floordiv" rel="noreferrer"><code>operator.floordiv()</code> function</a>. The reason for this division (no pun intended) is that the old Python 2 <code>/</code> operator would return an integer if both operands are integers, a float otherwise, while these two functions always return the same type, regardless of the type of inputs.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This would have been easily answered by checking the documentation for the <code>operator</code> module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DavidZ: so what if the OP is accidentally looking at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/operator.html#operator.div" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 2 documentation</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AkshatMahajan: but there <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/operator.html#operator.div" rel="nofollow noreferrer">is such an attribute</a>, in <i>Python 2</i>. Easy mistake to make, really.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree with @MartijnPieters.  I don't think this is a bad question.  I'm actually <i>really</i> surprised that <code>operator.div</code> isn't in python3.x (I'd expect it to do the same thing as <code>operator.truediv</code> -- Though I understand the reasoning for the change).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DavidZ: or the wrong tutorial. Or the wrong codebase. That doesn't change that this is not <i>confusing</i> and will trip up some people not familiar yet with the Python 2 to 3 transition. Just like <code>print item</code> vs <code>print(item)</code>. Or unicode, str, and bytes. Or <code>urllib2</code> vs. <code>urllib.request</code>. Etc. etc. etc. If you are starting with Python and the version divide is new to you, the documentation will <i>not necessarily be of much help</i>.</span>
