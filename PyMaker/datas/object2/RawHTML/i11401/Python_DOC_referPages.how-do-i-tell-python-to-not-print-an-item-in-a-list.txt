<p>For the time being I only have it skipping entries. Which would be a problem because if there's another duplicate further down the line in the RSS feed, then I'll have even more duplicates.</p>

<p>You can leverage the data structure <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset" rel="nofollow">set</a>, as its property of "uniqueness" will do the work for you. Essentially we can make your list a set and then the set a list again, which ensures your list is now populated with strictly unique values.</p>
<p>If you had a list l, then you could make it unique by</p>
<pre><code>l = list(set(l))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you don't want to print a repeating link you may use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow">counter</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict" rel="nofollow">defaultdict</a></p>
<pre><code>sm_posts = defaultdict(int)
sm_posts[sm_links] += 1
print sm_posts.keys() #will print all the unique links
</code></pre>
<p>the good thing is that you can also get the count of repetitions of links by doing </p>
<pre><code>sm_posts[sm_links]
&gt;&gt;&gt; link_counts
</code></pre>
<p>try it.</p>
