<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>im really new in python and i wanted to make a code that asks you for the coordinates and returns you the distance between 2 points in the plane. This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>def 2pointdistance(d):
    print(d)

xa = int(input("x1?: "))
xaa = int(input("x2?: "))
ya = int(input("y1?: "))
yaa = int(input("y2?: "))
xx = x1 - x2
yy = y1 - y2
xxx = xx ** 2
yyy = yy ** 2
xy = xxx + yyy
d = sqrt(xy)

2pointdistance(d)
</code></pre>
<p>hope you could please help me with this, i really liked this language
P.S.: Sorry for my english, im from chile </p>

<ol>
<li>The function name should not start with the digit</li>
<li>Your whole code (logic) should be in the function, not just a print statement</li>
<li>You define different variables then are actually used</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be something like</p>
<pre><code>def distance(x1,x2,y1,y2):
    xx = x1 - x2
    yy = y1 - y2
    xxx = xx ** 2
    yyy = yy ** 2
    xy = xxx + yyy
    return sqrt(xy)

x1 = int(input("x1?: "))
x2 = int(input("x2?: "))
y1 = int(input("y1?: "))
y2 = int(input("y2?: "))

print( distance( x1, x2, y1, y2 ) )
</code></pre>

<p><code>2pointdistance</code> is not a valid name for a function. A name should not start with a digit.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="nofollow">The docs</a> explain it in all detail, but the point is that the function name should start with a letter or an underscore.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the syntax error? And why did you wrap a <code>print</code> statement in a <code>2pointdistance</code>? What is the point, and also please use meaningful variable names.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is even more important, why you read data to the variables xa, ya ane then use x1 and x2? It has to lead to an error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oops i forgot to change the variables, i had it very clean and tidy, but then it came the errors and desperation</span>
