<p>My first question, please be gentle. I searched but could not find an answer here or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Note that this question does not apply to unpacking of arguments like *args.</p>
<p>In the python 3.3 documentation for <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/os.html?highlight=os#os.removexattr" rel="nofollow">os.removexattr</a> the following is stated:</p>
<pre><code>os.removexattr(path, attribute, *, follow_symlinks=True)

    Removes the extended filesystem attribute attribute from path.
    attribute should be bytes or str. If it is a string, it is encoded
    with the filesystem encoding.

    This function can support specifying a file descriptor and not
    following symlinks.
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the third argument is a star: *</p>
<p>I assumed that this means "specify one attribute or several attributes separated by comma",
but when trying to do that, I get an exception:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.removexattr('M7-AAE-01.jpg', 'user.camera_brand', 'user.camera_model')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    TypeError: Function takes at most 2 positional arguments (3 given)
</code></pre>
<p>I also tried to supply a list of arguments, but that did not work either.</p>
<p>What exactly does the star argument mean in this case?
Thank you.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The single asterisk <code>*</code> just means that it is forcing you to use named arguments. In this case if you want to pass a value for <code>follow_symlinks</code>, you have to pass the argument name. </p>
<p>The idea is you don't having to read function calls like <code>foo(True, False, False)</code> and not know what those values are doing.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your answer. I have looked at a few more Python documentation examples and realized that the * argument is always used before named arguments, so this is definitely the right answer. I have to say though, it is rather confusing, as it appears that the star would be another argument of some "magic" kind. Instead one should interpret it as "the * argument indicates that any arguments hereafter are named arguments". Something like that...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3122335: well, it seems your observation is not universal; for example <code>os.utime(path, times=None, *, [ns, ]dir_fd=None, follow_symlinks=True)</code>. Or is <code>ns</code> a keyword argument here as well?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">From the Python reference (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/…</a>): Parameters after “*” or “*identifier” are keyword-only parameters and may only be passed used keyword arguments.</span>
