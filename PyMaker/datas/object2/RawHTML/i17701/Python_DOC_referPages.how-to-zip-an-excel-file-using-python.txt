<p>Python's built in zipfile library can be used to compress any file. Below code should work for you.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import zipfile

zip_file = zipfile.ZipFile('file_name.zip', 'w')
zip_file.write('/tmp/hello.txt')
zip_file.close()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Aren't Excel files zip packages to begin with? What's the point in double zipping?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3085379: freakish is correct. Try opening a random xlsx file in your favourite zip tool, and you'll see it for yourself</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@pnuts I think xls is a zip container as well. At least, I'm able to open the file in 7-zip. Inside the file, it's 3 different files</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But it seems like you can decrease the size of (xlsx) excel files anyway. Check out <a href="http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/how-to-compress-xlsx-files-to-the-smallest-possible-size/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> link.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This Zip is nor really effective. The Compression ratio is just around 3% of the file.if the file is like 12,187KB the Compressed file is 12,100KB only. Any Other way to do the thing, I want to compress the file more.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Compression ratio depends upon the file type, text files gets compressed very well up to 90% but binary files like images, documents and others will not be that effective. you can try other compression technique like bz2, 7zip variants in which you might get slightly more compression.</span>
