<p>I am new to python, and I have these two python files. One of them is a terminal program, the other a hangman program. If I were to go on the terminal program and type "gm hangman.py" (I set up that command already) I want to switch to that python file. When the user is done with hangman (I programmed that too) I want it to go back to the terminal. I don't want to add the hangman file to the terminal because I want other people to be able to add their own games easily.</p>
<p>How would I do this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Your question isn't entirely clear, but I think you're looking for the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow"><code>subprocess</code></a> module. In particular, something like this:</p>
<pre><code>subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, 'hangman.py'])
</code></pre>
<p>As the docs explain, <code>check_call</code> will "Run command with arguments. Wait for command to complete." That's exactly what you want, right?</p>
<p>But what's the command? That's where <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.executable" rel="nofollow"><code>sys.executable</code></a> comes in: the command is the same Python interpreter that's running your "terminal program", and its argument is the Hangman program.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@user3146876: If my explanation isn't good enough, either read the linked docs, or ask a specific question; I'm not going to write a tutorial and complete reference on every detail of how <code>subprocess</code> works.</span>
