<p>Let us say I have a dictionary containing the file names and fullnames of 3 text files, all of the same number of lines, N.</p>
<pre><code>dof = {'myf1':'/a/b/myf1.txt', 'myf2':'/a/b/myf2.txt', 'myf3':'/a/b/myf3.txt'}
</code></pre>
<p>What'd be the most efficient/pythonic way to iterate over all files, each line as follows: </p>
<pre><code>line 1 of file 1, then line 1 of file 2, then line 1 of file 3;
line 2 of file 1, then line 2 of file 2, then line 2 of file 3;
...
line N of file 1, then line N of file 2, then line N of file 3; 
</code></pre>
<p>A general solution for any number of files in the dictionary and any number of total lines would be preferable.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>zip()</code> to iterate over the lines in triples:</p>
<pre><code>for line1, line2, line3 in zip(openfile1, openfile2, openfile3):
</code></pre>
<p>You could produce the open file handles with:</p>
<pre><code>files = [open(dof[name]) for name in sorted(dof)]

for lines in zip(*files):
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>lines</code> is a tuple of strings, the next line of each of the input files.</p>
<p>If the input files do <em>not</em> have the same number of lines, you can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.izip_longest" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.izip_longest()</code></a> instead to provide a replacement value for those lines missing (use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.zip_longest()</code></a> in Python 3).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">what is the order of the files ? The lexical order of the keys of the dict ? (there is no guarantee on the order of the items in a dict in python as far as I remember, so you should clarify what <code>file 1</code> means exactly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndreHolzner good point, the numbers could have perfectly been letters, the order is given by the keys you are right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what happens if not all files have the same number of lines ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndreHolzner: then the extra lines are ignored.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Martijn Pieters, looks like a great suggestion, just as a short follow up, how do i make it generic for the dictionary I have and any number of files?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dnaiel: See the additional edit I made :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dnaiel: <code>from itertools import izip</code>, then <code>for lines in izip(*files):</code>.</span>
