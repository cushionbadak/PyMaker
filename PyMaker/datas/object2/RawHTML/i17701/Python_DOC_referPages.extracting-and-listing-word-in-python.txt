<p>i have difficult to do this project 
python script to extract and list all words that meets the following conditions:
<br/>
(1) words with two consonants next to each other.<br/>
(2) words of length 5 or more that start and ends with a vowel.<br/>
(3) words of length 7 or more that starts with consonant and ends with a vowel.<br/>
(4) Abbreviate 2-3 words that all start with a capital letter.<br/></p>
<p>Any pointers on how to code this, helps, or even code examples would be much appreciated.
need your help.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First, how to include regular expressions in a Python program:</p>
<pre><code>import re

if re.match(pattern, string_to_match):
    # there is a match
else:
    # there is no match
</code></pre>
<p>Then, the first regular expression you need. As you haven't given any code, and this question smells of homework I won't give you the others.</p>
<pre><code> re.match(r"^[aeiou].{,3}[aeiou]$", string_to_match)
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>The <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> ensure that the match is from the beginning to end of the string.
The <code>[aeiou]</code> checks for a character that is a vowel.
The <code>.{,3}</code> checks for up to 3 repetitions of any character (represented by <code>.</code>).</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz"+"bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz".upper()
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
</code></pre>
<p>a word has 2 consonants if</p>
<pre><code>re.find("[%s]{2,}"%consonants,the_word_to_check)
</code></pre>
<p>a word is longer than 5 if <code>len(the_word) &gt; 5</code></p>
<p>a word starts and ends with a vowel if <code>re.match("^[{0}].*[{0}]$".format(vowels),the_word)</code></p>
<p>I'll leave the rest as an excersize for you ...</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What code do you have so far?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Downvoters, don't forget that it is a first post.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I miss the "minimal understanding" and "include attempted solutions" reasons for a question being off-topic... :,(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@iCodez Yeah, what happened there? Where's the meta thread discussing the change?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sweeneyrod - True, but none of the off-topic reasons we have now accurately fill the void left by the ones they removed.  I think they should bring them back.  At the very least do the "attempted solutions" one.</span>
