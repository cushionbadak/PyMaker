<p>I'm using openpyxl 1.7.0 with python 3.3. I have used Excel 2007 and 2010 with the code</p>
<p>I created a basic excel 2007 workbook with cells A1-A21 filled with a random number in each one to test the code on their website. I saved the excel sheet as "thetest". The sheet that the numbers are on is called Sheet1. This is the code I ran.</p>
<pre><code>from openpyxl import load_workbook

wb = load_workbook(filename = r'thetest.xlsx')

sheet_ranges = wb.get_sheet_by_name(name = 'Sheet1')

print sheet_ranges.cell('A14').value
</code></pre>
<p>I ran this code and got a message that highlighted the second "sheet_ranges" that has .cell after it and said invalid syntax. What is going on with this? Are there any good tutotrials for using this module as well?</p>

<p>In Python 3.x, <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print</code></a> should be used as function form.</p>
<pre><code>print(sheet_ranges.cell('A14').value)
#    ^                              ^

<span class="comment-copy">In Python 3, print is a function. Use <code>print(sheet_ranges.cell('A14').value)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked, thank you. I'm just getting the hang of programming.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did not see @falsetru answer when I left my comment. I'm glad it worked out.</span>
