<p>I want to create an on-screen input box that a user can interact with.</p>
<p>The user would see a window with an input field they can click with the mouse. The user could type or erase text in the field, then press OK once they have finished adding text. Lastly, my program would store this text for later use.</p>
<p>How can I create a text box in Python which allows user input?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could try the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html" rel="noreferrer">Tkinter</a> module:</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter import *

master = Tk()
e = Entry(master)
e.pack()

e.focus_set()

def callback():
    print e.get() # This is the text you may want to use later

b = Button(master, text = "OK", width = 10, command = callback)
b.pack()

mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>

<p>Of course, you may want to read a <strong>Tkinter</strong> tutorial.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The simplest way to do it is to set an input equal to a variable for later use, and then call the variable later in the program.</p>
<pre><code>variable = str(input("Type into the text box."))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I think he wanted a simple example, like <code>myText=tkSimpleDialog.askstring("Title","Enter a string:")</code>. This is the most simple solution, however, I never used it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sasszem Your suggested code errors with <code>NameError: name 'tkSimpleDialog' is not defined</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to import it first, with <code>import tkSimpleDialog</code></span>
