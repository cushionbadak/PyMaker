<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have 3 lists and I would like to combine my three lists into another list with tuples or lists inside with these  three lists mixed, like this:</p>
<pre><code>years = [2012,2013,2011,2014,2015]
sessions = ["AC", "AB"]
periods = ["I", "II", "III"]
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to know if there is a function or what is the most <strong>Pythonic</strong> way to do the next:</p>
<pre><code>result = function(years,sessions,periods)
print result 

##  [(2012, "AC", "I"), (2012, "AC", "II"), (2012, "AC", "III"), (2012, "AB", "I")] and so on
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="noreferrer"><code>itertools.product()</code></a></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; years = [2012,2013,2011,2014,2015]
&gt;&gt;&gt; sessions = ["AC", "AB"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; periods = ["I", "II", "III"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import product
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(product(years, sessions, periods))
[(2012, 'AC', 'I'), (2012, 'AC', 'II'), (2012, 'AC', 'III'), (2012, 'AB', 'I'), (2012, 'AB', 'II'), (2012, 'AB', 'III'), (2013, 'AC', 'I'), (2013, 'AC', 'II'), (2013, 'AC', 'III'), (2013, 'AB', 'I'), (2013, 'AB', 'II'), (2013, 'AB', 'III'), (2011, 'AC', 'I'), (2011, 'AC', 'II'), (2011, 'AC', 'III'), (2011, 'AB', 'I'), (2011, 'AB', 'II'), (2011, 'AB', 'III'), (2014, 'AC', 'I'), (2014, 'AC', 'II'), (2014, 'AC', 'III'), (2014, 'AB', 'I'), (2014, 'AB', 'II'), (2014, 'AB', 'III'), (2015, 'AC', 'I'), (2015, 'AC', 'II'), (2015, 'AC', 'III'), (2015, 'AB', 'I'), (2015, 'AB', 'II'), (2015, 'AB', 'III')]

<p>Note that <code>product()</code> returns an iterable; I've just converted it to a list above for demonstration purposes, but you shouldn't do so unless you definitely need a list.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You are like a god man, thank you SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@VictorCastilloTorres No problem, glad I could help. It might behoove you to skim through <code>itertools</code> if you have time, since there are some very useful functions there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'll see the doc, thank you so much again :) Keep helping :)</span>
