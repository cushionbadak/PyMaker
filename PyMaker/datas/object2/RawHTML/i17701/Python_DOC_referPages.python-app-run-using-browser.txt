<p>you should run your code using server. there are many available. for example:</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/wsgiref.html?highlight=simple%20server#wsgiref.simple_server.make_server" rel="nofollow">a link</a></p>
<p>your code will be triggered through demo_app in example from link above.</p>
