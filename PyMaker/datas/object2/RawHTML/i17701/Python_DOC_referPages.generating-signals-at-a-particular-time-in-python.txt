<p>I am running my code in Linux os. I want to know if it is possible to generate a signal at a particular time in one function which is caught by another function in Python code?
By signal I mean like SIGALRM</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A <code>SIGALRM</code> signal (read <em>carefully</em> <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html" rel="nofollow">signal(7)</a> and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/time.7.html" rel="nofollow">time(7)</a> ...) can be emitted by alarms or timers, notably those created by <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timer_create.2.html" rel="nofollow">timer_create(2)</a> and set by <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timer_settime.2.html" rel="nofollow">timer_settime(2)</a> (or the older <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setitimer.2.html" rel="nofollow">setitimer(2)</a> ...). You set the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_signal" rel="nofollow">signal</a> handler using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html" rel="nofollow">sigaction(2)</a>.</p>
<p>Notice that signals are sent to the process (or to some thread in it), independently of the function currently executed. They could be masked using <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigprocmask.2.html" rel="nofollow">sigprocmask(2)</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to send or raise a signal, use <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kill.2.html" rel="nofollow">kill(2)</a>. From outside your process (i.e. in some other terminal), use the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/kill.1.html" rel="nofollow">kill(1)</a> command.</p>
<p>You want to use the Python wrappers of these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syscall" rel="nofollow">syscalls</a>. Read about the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html" rel="nofollow">signal</a> module of Python.</p>
<p>And read <a href="http://advancedlinuxprogramming.com/" rel="nofollow">Advanced Linux Programming</a> to get a better picture (in your mind) about these issues.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Linux specific <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timerfd_create.2.html" rel="nofollow">timerfd_create(2)</a> could be useful to you (at least if you have some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop" rel="nofollow">event loop</a> around e.g. <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html" rel="nofollow">poll(2)</a>). </p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "signal"? This is very vague; it could be anything from a return value to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_signal" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Unix signal</a> to a modification of some object's state. If you mean the kind of signal the tag specifies, do you want some other process to receive the signal?</span>
