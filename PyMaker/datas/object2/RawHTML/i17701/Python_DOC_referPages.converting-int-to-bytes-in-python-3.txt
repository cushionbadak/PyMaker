<p>I was trying to build this bytes object in Python 3:</p>
<p><code>b'3\r\n'</code></p>
<p>so I tried the obvious (for me), and found a weird behaviour:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; bytes(3) + b'\r\n'
b'\x00\x00\x00\r\n'
</code></pre>
<p>Apparently:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; bytes(10)
b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
</code></pre>
<p>I've been unable to see any pointers on why the bytes conversion works this way reading the documentation. However, I did find some surprise messages in this Python issue about adding <code>format</code> to bytes (see also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/15710515/554319">Python 3 bytes formatting</a>):</p>
<p><a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue3982" rel="noreferrer">http://bugs.python.org/issue3982</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This interacts even more poorly with oddities like bytes(int) returning zeroes now</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be much more convenient for me if bytes(int) returned the ASCIIfication of that int; but honestly, even an error would be better than this behavior.  (If I wanted this behavior - which I never have - I'd rather it be a classmethod, invoked like "bytes.zeroes(n)".)</p>

<p>Can someone explain me where this behaviour comes from?</p>

<p>That's the way it was designed - and it makes sense because usually, you would call <code>bytes</code> on an iterable instead of a single integer:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; bytes([3])
b'\x03'
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html#binaryseq">docs state this</a>, as well as the docstring for <code>bytes</code>:</p>

<p>The ASCIIfication of 3 is <code>"\x33"</code> not <code>"\x03"</code>!</p>
<p>That is what python does for <code>str(3)</code> but it would be totally wrong for bytes, as they should be considered arrays of binary data and not be abused as strings.</p>
<p>The most easy way to achieve what you want is <code>bytes((3,))</code>, which is better than <code>bytes([3])</code> because initializing a list is much more expensive, so never use lists when you can use tuples. You can convert bigger integers by using <code>int.to_bytes(3, "little")</code>.</p>
<p>Initializing bytes with a given length makes sense and is the most useful, as they are often used to create some type of buffer for which you need some memory of given size allocated. I often use this when initializing arrays or expanding some file by writing zeros to it.</p>

<p>I was curious about performance of various methods for a single int in the range <code>[0, 255]</code>, so I decided to do some timing tests.</p>
<p>Based on the timings below, and from the general trend I observed from trying many different values and configurations, <code>struct.pack</code> seems to be the fastest, followed by <code>int.to_bytes</code>, <code>bytes</code>, and with <code>str.encode</code> (unsurprisingly) being the slowest. Note that the results show some more variation than is represented, and <code>int.to_bytes</code> and <code>bytes</code> sometimes switched speed ranking during testing, but <code>struct.pack</code> is clearly the fastest.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It is unclear from your question if you want the integer value 3, or the value of the ASCII character representing number three (integer value 51).  The first is bytes([3]) == b'\x03'.  The latter is bytes([ord('3')]) == b'3'.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Beware that the above works only with python 3. In python 2 <code>bytes</code> is just an alias for <code>str</code>, which means <code>bytes([3])</code> gives you <code>'[3]'</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, that's why the question is tagged python-3.x...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you're right, sorry - I did not read the Q carefully</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@A-B-B: Not really surprising since a byte can only store values between 0 and 255.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It should also be noted that <code>bytes([3])</code> is still different from what the OP wanted – namely the byte value used to encode the digit "3" in ASCII, ie. <code>bytes([51])</code>, which is <code>b'3'</code>, not <code>b'\x03'</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this answer is good, it works only for unsigned (non-negative) integers. I have adapted it write an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54141411/832230">answer</a> which also works for signed integers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndyHayden To clarify, since a struct has a standard size irrespective of the input, <code>I</code>, <code>H</code>, and <code>B</code> work till <code>2**k - 1</code> where k is 32, 16, and 8 respectively. For larger inputs they raise <code>struct.error</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Presumably down-voted as it doesn't answer the question: the OP wants to know how to generate <code>b'3\r\n'</code>, i.e. a byte-string containing the ASCII character "3" not the ASCII character "\x03"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DaveJones What makes you think that is what the OP wants? The <b>accepted answer</b> returns <code>\x03</code>, and the solution if you just want <code>b'3'</code> is trivial. The reason cited by A-B-B is much more plausible... or at least understandable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DaveJones Also, the reason I added this answer was because Google takes you here when searching to do precisely this. So that's why it's here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not only does this work the same in 2 and 3, but it's faster than both the <code>bytes([x])</code> and <code>(x).to_bytes()</code> methods in Python 3.5. That was unexpected.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I ended up doing <code>bytes(str(n), 'ascii') + b'\r\n'</code> or <code>str(n).encode('ascii') + b'\r\n'</code>. Thanks! :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Juanlu001, also <code>"{}\r\n".format(n).encode()</code> I don't think there is any harm done by using the default utf8 encoding</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are several problems with this answer: (a) The escape notation of <code>b'3'</code>is <code>b'\x33'</code>, not <code>b'\x32'</code>. (b) <code>(3)</code> is not a tuple – you have to add a comma. (c) The scenario of initialising a sequence with zeroes does not apply to <code>bytes</code> objects, as they are immutable (it makes sense for <code>bytearray</code>s, though).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your comment. I fixed those two obvious mistakes. In case of <code>bytes</code> and <code>bytearray</code>, I think it's mostly a matter of consistency. But it is also useful if you want to push some zeros into a buffer or file, in which case it is only used as a data source.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">'hex_value = '%x' % i' will not work under Python 3.4. You get a TypeError, so you'd have to use hex() instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bjmc replaced with str.format. This should work on Python 2.6+.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, @renskiy. You might want to use 'hex_codec' instead of 'hex' because it seems like 'hex' alias is not available on all Python 3 releases see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/12917604/845210">stackoverflow.com/a/12917604/845210</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bjmc fixed. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This fails on negative integers on python 3.6</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@A-B-B As mentioned in my first sentence, I'm only measuring this for a single int in the range <code>[0, 255]</code>. I assume by "wrong indicator" you mean my measurements weren't general enough to fit most situations? Or was my measuring methodology poor? If the latter, I would be interested to hear what you have to say, but if the former, I never claimed my measurements were generic to all use-cases. For my (perhaps niche) situation, I am only dealing with ints in the range <code>[0, 255]</code>, and that is the audience I intended to address with this answer. Was my answer unclear? I can edit it for clarity...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What about the technique of just indexing a precomputed encoding for the range? The precomputation wouldn't be subject to timing, only the indexing would be.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@A-B-B That's a good idea. That sounds like it will be faster than anything else. I'll do some timing and add it to this answer when I have some time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you really want to time the bytes-from-iterable thing, you should use <code>bytes((i,))</code> instead of <code>bytes([i])</code> because list are more complex, use more memory and take long to initialize. In this case, for nothing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The is just plain wrong, here you get a byte representation of a string not and int.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This will give b'1024' which is a string</span>
