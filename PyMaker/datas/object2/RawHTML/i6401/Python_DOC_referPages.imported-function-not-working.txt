<p>I am pretty new to Python and am trying to import a function I have made in a separate file. When I run the code I get <strong>"TypeError: signal() missing 1 required positional argument: 'handler'"</strong>. I think it means the signal function is not being passed a single argument but I am pretty sure that is what the for loop does. Where am I going wrong? Also, the files are in the same folder, which is a part of the working directory. The code that calls the function is:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

t=np.linspace(-5,5,200)

import signal

y=[]
for i in t:
    y.append(signal.signal(i))
</code></pre>
<p>The function code is saved in a file called signal.py. The code is:</p>
<pre><code>def signal(t):
    import numpy as np
    y=np.cos(t)*np.exp(-abs(t))
    return y
</code></pre>

<p>It seems you are trying to import a <code>signal</code> from the standard library instead of your own file. Try to import it like this:</p>
<pre><code>from .signal import signal
</code></pre>
<p>PS: Since you are new to Python, you should also make sure you have a an <code>__init__.py</code> file in the directory, like so:</p>
<pre><code>/Parent
    __init__.py
    main.py
    signal.py
</code></pre>

<p>As suggested by chepner, you have a module name conflict with pythons inbuilt module <code>signal</code></p>
<p>If the name is not important, then you could change the name.</p>
<p>If the name is important then you could create a package and place the file in that, Then import it.</p>
<p>For example, following will be your directory tree</p>
<pre><code>signal_module/
├── __init__.py
└── signal.py
original_file.py
</code></pre>
<p>Then import the <code>signal_module</code> as follows</p>
<pre><code>from signal_module import signal
</code></pre>
<p><b>The <code>__init__.py</code> file is import.</b></p>
<p>It can be empty, but it needs to be created for python to tree the directory as package.</p>
<p>As you said you are new to python, have a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448271/what-is-init-py-for">this answer</a> to know more about the importance of <code>__init__.py</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">"It is not working" is not a specific description of a problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">True, I have updated the question to be more specific.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>signal</code> is a module in the standard library; you are importing that, not your <code>signal.py</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are importing this: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! Seems a silly question now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My pleasure. No question is silly, it may still help someone.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TomWeisner It was a very real problem, which led to the change in Python documented in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328</a>.</span>
