<p>Trying to use a MANIFEST.in file (contains one line):</p>
<pre><code>recursive-include etc *
</code></pre>
<p>To install some files for systemd (yea, I'm holding my nose about that part)</p>
<p>I see the files get added to the tarball by sdist, but nothing will cause them to install.</p>
<p>setup.py contains the following lines</p>
<pre><code>  packages=find_packages(),
  include_package_data=True,
</code></pre>
<p>Then if I add this to setup.py and remove the MANIFEST.in</p>
<pre><code>  data_files=[
      ('etc/systemd/system/', ['etc/systemd/system/uwsgi.service'])
  ],
</code></pre>
<p>they install as expected.  Is there something missing that I need to add for MANIFEST.in to work instead of enumerating all the files by name in setup.py?</p>

<p><code>package_data</code> and <code>data_files</code> are not the same thing.  <code>package_data</code> are files that are stored &amp; installed in the same directory as your <code>*.py</code> files (hence the "package" part); <code>include_package_data</code> thus only marks <a href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#new-and-changed-setup-keywords" rel="nofollow noreferrer">data files it finds <em>inside your package directories</em></a> (emphasis added) as package data.  Unless your code is stored under <code>etc/</code> in your package source, none of your files will be treated as package data.  In order to install files <em>outside</em> your Python package directory, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">you need to use <code>data_files</code></a>, and there is no shortcut as there is with <code>include_package_data</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I checked and this was indeed the case.  Thanks</span>
