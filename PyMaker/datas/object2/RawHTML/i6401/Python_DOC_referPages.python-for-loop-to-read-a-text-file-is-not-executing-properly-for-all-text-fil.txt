<p>i am having a doubt regarding the below code.</p>
<p>i am trying to take a txt file as an input which will have the data as below </p>
<pre><code>aaaaaaaaaa
bbbbbbbbbb
cccccccccc
</code></pre>
<p>and pass it to the searchForJob function to perform a search in different file but my for loop of input file is not executing properly it is not taking all the three lines of input file. It is only picking either the second line ( bbbbbbbb ) or third line ( ccccccccc ). Can someone pls help me on this. I am new to python language.</p>
<pre><code>def searchForJob(job):
    with open('some location/Jls.txt',"U") as lines:
        for line in lines:
            if line.find(job)!=-1:
                print(job + ' : Found')
                break;

    return




jobNames = open('some location/JNames.txt')
try:
    for job in jobNames:
        print(job)
        searchForJob(job)
finally:
    jobNames.close()

<p>When reading a file, use the <code>r</code> mode.</p>
<p>Each line has a trailing <code>\n</code>, so you need to <code>strip()</code> them. Use <code>repr(...)</code> function so that you can see the trailing white spaces.</p>
<p>Use Python language features such as the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>with</code> statement</a>, the <a href="http://www.jworks.nl/2013/11/07/python-goodness-the-in-keyword/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>in</code> keyword</a></p>

Searching for job 'name 2'
'name 2' : Found in 'job 1, name 2...\n'
Searching for job 'name 3'

<span class="comment-copy">What is the "U" supposed to do in the second argument of <code>open</code> in <code>searchForJob</code>? i would expect that to be a mode.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">'U' is perhaps to see new lines in the txt file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you want to search aaaaa bbbbbb cccc in multi text files?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes milti text file means it will be a raw text file with 'n' number of lines</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MykWillis "U" is the universal newline mode (no more available in Python 3) to convert non-Linux line-endings</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i am still getting the same output. same prob occurring again :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AmritpalsinghThethi Did you check for the ending <code>\n</code> new line characters?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thnx a lot :) ...... it worked perfectly now</span>
