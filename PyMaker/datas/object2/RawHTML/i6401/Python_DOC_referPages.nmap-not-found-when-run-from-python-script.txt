<p>I have written basic port scanner for target ip and when I run it through kali vm it says <code>sh: 1: nmap-F192.168.234.135: not found</code>. but when I run <code>nmap -F 192.168.234.135</code> ... its perfectly working. Can anyone point out the reason behind it. thanks</p>
<pre><code>import os

def get_nmap(options,ip):
    command = "nmap" + options + "" + ip
    process = os.popen(command)
    result = str(process.read())
    return result

print(get_nmap('-F','192.168.234.135'))
</code></pre>

<p>Better, using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess</code></a> module:</p>
<pre><code>def get_nmap(options, ip) :
    return subprocess.check_output(["nmap", options, ip])
#end get_nmap
</code></pre>

<p>You need to add spaces in the command string. Change it to</p>
<pre><code>  command = "nmap " + options + " " + ip
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">... "Writing a port scanner in python" isn't really just the process of invoking <code>nmap</code> via Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need a space between options and IP. Change it to command = "nmap" + options + " " + ip</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I dont get how this is now the accepted answer. The question was already answered and this has nothing to do with why it was originaly not working.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is better to avoid going through the shell when you donâ€™t have to.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The OP asked for the reason why his code isn't working. This isn't an answer to that question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much .... Its working fine now... appreciate your quick reply</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem. Remember to mark as answered.</span>
