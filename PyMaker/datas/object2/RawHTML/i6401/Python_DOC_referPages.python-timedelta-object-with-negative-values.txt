<p>I don't quite understand how negative arguments in <code>datetime.timedelta</code> are interpreted. </p>
<p>With Positive values:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import timedelta
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = timedelta(days=1,seconds=1,microseconds=1,milliseconds=1,minutes=1,hours=1,weeks=1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (d.days, d.seconds, d.microseconds)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (8, 3661, 1001)
</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty straightforward. A similar example with negative values looks like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import timedelta
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = timedelta(days=-1,seconds=-1,microseconds=-1,milliseconds=-1,minutes=-1,hours=-1,weeks=-1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (d.days, d.seconds, d.microseconds)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (-9, 82738, 998999) 
</code></pre>
<p>As per my understanding seconds and microseconds are derived like:</p>
<ul>
<li>seconds = <code>86399 - (-60-3600-1)</code></li>
<li>microseconds = <code>999999 - (-1-1000)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Is this correct? How come days equals -9?</p>
<p>I am reading <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> section of docs. But still don't quite understand the working with negative values. Please share explanations or relevant documentation links. Thanks :)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It makes complete sense, <code>(-1 week + -1 day) + (-1 hours) + (-1 minutes) + (-1 seconds) + (-1 milliseconds) + (-1 microseconds)</code> equals to:    <code>(-8 days) + (-1 hours) + (-1 minutes) + (-1 seconds) + (-1 milliseconds) + (-1 microseconds)</code></p>
<p>By having less than -8 days, with -1 hours, -1 minutes, ... the number of days will have to be even less than -8 to make the negative hours, minutes, seconds... into positive hours, minutes, seconds....(since only days can be represented negatively, others,such as seconds, are always represented positively). Which means that days will have to be -9.</p>
<p>If you print <code>d</code> , you will get <code>-9 days 22:58:58.998999</code>, with negative 9 days and positive 22+ hours. Seeing the <code>str</code> of the <code>timedelta</code> could help you have better understanding of how negative <code>timedelta</code> is represented. </p>

<p>Because of the way timedeltas are stored internally, <strong>only the <code>days</code> attribute can take on negative values</strong>. This can be surprising when the timedelta is printed back. An <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/datetime-timedelta.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">illuminating example from the docs</a>,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = timedelta(microseconds=-1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (d.days, d.seconds, d.microseconds)
(-1, 86399, 999999)
</code></pre>
<p>ie. -1d + 86399s + 999999µs = -1µs</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's much easier to read (and make sense of) <code>timedelta</code> calls if you use named arguments btw...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Agreed and edited</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the resultant number of days are -8, but due to negative hours, mins, secs... the days become -9. So everytime days are decremented by 1 if there are negative hours, mins secs? What if some of the arguments are non-negative?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Imagine the timedelta is on a number line that has an increment of one day, if the days itself is negative -8, and and the decimals are still negative, the days will bounce to the next left whole, since only days can be negative. If the days is -8, and others (not including weeks) or the sum of others are positive, then days will remain -8. <code>timedelta(days=-1, seconds=1, weeks=-1)</code> the number of days would remain -8, as there’s a positive second, <code>timedelta(days=-1, minutes=1, seconds=-1, weeks=-1)</code> the number of days is still -8 because the sum of 1 minute and -1 second is positive 59 minutes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah right!. I get the idea now. Thanks for the explanation.</span>
