<p>how am I suppose to do the multiplication based on repeated additions, but calling the add() function that I made, into the multiply function? I thought of using the add() function in the "for" loop but I just can't think of how I would actually do it.</p>
<p>Edit: My question is basically how can I use the "add()" function into the multiply() function in a for loop to make a multiplication operation based on repeated additions?</p>
<p><strong><em>SOURCE CODE:</em></strong></p>
<pre><code>def add (num1,num2):
    return num1 + num2

def subtract (num1,num2):
    return num1 - num2

def multiply(num1,num2):

    sum_of_num = 0
    for i in range(0,num2,1):
        sum_of_num += num1
    return sum_of_num
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Simply change the <code>+=</code> with your <code>add</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>def add(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

def subtract(num1, num2):
    return num1 - num2

def multiply(num1, num2):
    sum_of_num = 0
    for i in range(num2):
        sum_of_num = add(sum_of_num, num1)
    return sum_of_num
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, but can I know what you mean by for i in range(num2)? like is that starting from range 0 to num2? or what is that doing excalty and thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>range(start, stop, step)</code></a>, if omitted, <code>start</code> defaults to <code>0</code> and <code>step</code> to <code>1</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great that explains it and makes a lot of sense.</span>
