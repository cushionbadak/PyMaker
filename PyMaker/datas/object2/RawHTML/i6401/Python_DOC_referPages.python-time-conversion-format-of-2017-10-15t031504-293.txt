<p>I am having trouble converting the date time string <code>2017-10-15T03:15:04.293</code> into a Date object in python, simply because I can't figure out the format.</p>
<p>I have the code line: <code>x.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')</code>, which accurately gives me the date itself, but lacks the time obviously. When trying to modify the string formatter, I am getting confused by the <code>T</code>, and the last decimal <code>.293</code> (from the example above).</p>
<p>Can someone help me understand what these values mean in this timestamp, and what the proper <code>x.strftime('&lt;WHAT GOES HERE ???&gt;')</code> might be?</p>

<p>The numbers after the <code>.</code> are microseconds. You can parse it using the <code>datetime</code> module, like so:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime
datetime.strptime('2017-10-15T03:15:04.293', '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f')
</code></pre>
<p>The format looks like ISO-8601, which is a widely-used standard. But it appears that <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue15873" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>datetime</code> module doesn't yet provide a way</a> to parse this without providing the format-string yourself.</p>
