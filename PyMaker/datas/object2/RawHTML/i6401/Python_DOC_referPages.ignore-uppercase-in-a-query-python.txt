<p>I have this code</p>
<pre><code>query = request.GET.get("q")
    if query:
        if query == "song" or query == "songs":
            return render(request, 'music/cloud.html', {
                'songs': song_results,
                'generic_songs': song_results_generic,
            })
</code></pre>
<p>The thing is, I want the "if" statement to ignor uppercases.
For example, when the user search by "SoNg" or "SonG" or.. it will be converted to "song" before testing</p>

<p>Use .lower() </p>
<pre><code>if query.lower() in ['song', 'songs']:

<p>In Python3.3+, you should prefer <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.casefold" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.casefold</code>
</a>.</p>
<pre><code>if query.casefold() in ['song'.casefold(), 'songs'.casefold()]:
</code></pre>
<p>From the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be used for caseless matching.</p>
<p>Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it is intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example, the German lowercase letter 'ß' is equivalent to "ss". Since it is already lowercase, lower() would do nothing to 'ß'; casefold() converts it to "ss".</p>
<p>The casefolding algorithm is described in section 3.13 of the Unicode Standard.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Compare to <code>query.lower()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But when you are using lower() make sure that what you are comparing is also ".lower()" because python IS case sensitive.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the fact that this text comes from a <code>request.get</code> seems irrelevant here, it's just case insensitive string matching.</span>
