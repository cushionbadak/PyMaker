<p>first of all, I'm brand new to python, and have basic understanding of c/c++/c# which are all statically typed languages. So can the following be done in python?</p>
<p>I want the variable birthday to be a datetime. So that whenever I instantiate I have to pass a datetime in with the parameters.</p>
<pre><code>import datetime

class Person:
    """class representing a person."""

    def __init__(self, name, sirname, gender, birthday):
        self.name = name
        self.sirname = sirname
        self.gender = gender
        self.birthday = datetime.date(birthday)

    def getage(self):
        """returns age"""
        today = datetime.date.today()
        return today.year - self.birthday.year
</code></pre>
<p>Further down I instantiate as following</p>
<pre><code>BIRTHDAY = datetime.date(1989, 10, 9)
NIELSON = Person('Nielson', 'Jansen', 'Male', BIRTHDAY)
</code></pre>
<p>this gives me the error:
<em>TypeError: an integer is required (got type datetime.date)</em></p>
<p>is my instantiate wrong or should i get the following out of my head asap with python? </p>
<pre><code>self.birthday = datetime.date(birthday)
</code></pre>
<p>(Why I would like to do this is so that the <em>getage</em> method always is presented with a datetime.date instead of something random if I make an instantiate mistake.)</p>
<p>PS: also, if my terminology is not correct, donâ€™t hesitate to correct me. :)</p>

<p>I'm assuming that you fix</p>
<pre><code>self.birthday = datetime.date(birthday)
</code></pre>
<p>into</p>
<pre><code>self.birthday = birthday
</code></pre>
<p>as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46837568/python-statically-typed-constructor#comment80622774_46837568">suggested by jonrsharpe</a>.</p>
<p>Now if you want to check the type of birthday, you can write</p>
<pre><code>assert isinstance(birthday, datetime.date)
</code></pre>
<p>at the beginning of the constructor. This is however not a static check because the check will only be performed when the assertion will run.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you're already passing in a <code>datetime</code>, why are you then trying to convert it to a <code>datetime</code>? See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a> - if you pass a single argument, it's expected to be a year.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python doesn't have static-type checking. You are seeing <i>runtime</i> type-checking, which is occuring because you are passing an argument of the wrong type to <code>datetime.date</code>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that cleared some things up, thank you.</span>
