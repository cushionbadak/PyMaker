<p>I am writing a rock, paper and scissors bot for a school project. I keep getting the error in the title (<code>TypeError: randint() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given</code>) and I don't know why. My code is below.</p>
<pre><code>if userInput : 'rock'
choice = random.randint(1,2,3)
if choice == 1:
    await client.send_message(message.channel, embed=RockEmbed)

elif choice == 2:
    await client.send_message(message.channel, embed=PaperEmbed)

elif choice == 3:
    await client.send_message(message.channel, embed=ScissorsEmbed)

if userInput : 'scissors'
choice2 = random.randint(1,2,3)
if choice2 == 1:
    await client.send_message(message.channel, embed=RockEmbed)
elif choice2 == 2:
    await client.send_message(message.channel, embed=PaperEmbed)
elif choice2 == 3:
    await client.send_message(message.channel, embed=ScissorsEmbed)

if userInput : 'paper'
choice3 = random.randint(1,2,3)
if choice3 == 1:
    await client.send_message(message.channel, embed=RockEmbed)
elif choice3 == 2:
    await client.send_message(message.channel, embed=PaperEmbed)
elif choice3 == 3:
    await client.send_message(message.channel, embed=ScissorsEmbed)   
</code></pre>
<p>I've said <code>random.randint(1,2,3)</code>, which is clearly 3 arguments, not 4. I'm, pretty sure my syntax is correct, but not 100%.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>random.randint</code> only takes two arguments, a start and an end. The third argument mentioned by Python is <code>self</code>, which is done automatically.</p>
<p>To pick a number between 1 and 3, just do <code>random.randint(1,3)</code>.</p>
<p>Those <code>if</code> statements don't make any sense, by the way; they should look something like:</p>
<pre><code>if userInput == "paper":
    # send discord messages
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that <code>random.randint()</code> is a method, which has a <code>self</code> argument that counts as one of the arguments. If you are passing in 3 arguments, that makes it 4 in total. Read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint" rel="nofollow noreferrer">function documentation</a> to see what arguments it accepts.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That quality filter is there for a reason. Your work-around is not appreciated. You didn't need to post that much code; simply <code>random.randint(1, 2, 3)</code> already shows the error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The documentation I linked to is pretty clear on what the function does. You can't pass in 3 arguments. Either use <code>random.randint(1, 3)</code> or use <code>random.choice([1, 2, 3])</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your <code>if</code> statements do not do what you want them to do; they all are true if <code>userInput</code> is a non-empty string, followed by a string object that is ignored. You could remove each of your <code>if userInput ...</code> lines and your program would do exactly the same thing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You only have to make the choice <b>once</b>, then pick responses based on the user input (use <code>if userInput == 'rock':</code>, etc.)</span>
