<p>I am working on decryption a PGP file which I could accomplish using Python as I absolutely could not find the resources/example for it. I did raise the problem <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46542520/python-pgp-key-decryption">here</a> with no luck!</p>
<p>However, I did develop some code in Java to decrypt the file. </p>
<p>Now, I want to invoke this jar file from my python code since I can find people using the os.system or subprocess.call to invoke external programmes in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>Below is the sample code which is supposed to do the work:</p>
<pre><code> os.system("java -jar PGPEncryption.jar BC.csv.pgp X.csv &lt;password&gt;")

 x = subprocess.call(["java -jar PGPEncryption.jar BC.csv.pgp X.csv &lt;password&gt;"], shell=True)
 print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>I have no luck with printing a result. </p>
<p>Any Suggestions will be really appreciated!!</p>
<p>EDIT:
I have also tried below code:</p>
<pre><code>subprocess.call(['java', '-jar', 'abc.jar'])
</code></pre>
<p>it's not working and gives below error:</p>
<pre><code> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here your first problem is with your java version with which you have compiled the code and java version with which you are running the code. </p>
<p>For example, if you have compiled the code with java version 8 and you are running the java application with java version 7 or 6 (lower than compiled one) you will get a <code>Unsupported major.minor version 52.0</code> error. Hence compile the code with a lower or same version than your server one. </p>
<p>Check the version in your server : java --version</p>
<p>Check the version in your development tool with which you have compiled the code</p>
<p>In the below code, provide full path to your jar file as well.</p>
<p><code>os.system("java -jar \fullpath\PGPEncryption.jar BC.csv.pgp X.csv &lt;password&gt;")</code></p>

<p>If you want to use modules in JAR file in python code, the you need to run that py file using JYTHON.</p>
<pre><code>java -jar jython.jar demo.py
</code></pre>

<p>Subprocess with Popen</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess

x = subprocess.Popen("java -jar PGPEncryption.jar BC.csv.pgp X.csv &lt;password&gt;", stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

out,err = x.communicate()

print "Error is - ",err
print "Output is -",out

<span class="comment-copy">AFAIK, running with <code>shell=True</code> should print the results to <code>stdout</code>, i.e you don't need to print <code>x</code>. Maybe a better solution is to generate a CompletedProcess object, which has <code>stdout</code> as an attribute. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this documentation</a>, the python page explaining subprocess.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Parth S Rawal, Please see my answer below. That might help you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks it worked! there was a problem with the version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Parth S Rawal, You accepted the wrong answer not mine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oops!! Sorry :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, I want to run .JAR file in Python Program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please check the update</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is what the error, i am getting: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: pgpencryption/PGPExampleUtil : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0. Note that this code is working just fine if i run the same from command prompt.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The error is related to the jar file your are using</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try running jar file manually</span>
