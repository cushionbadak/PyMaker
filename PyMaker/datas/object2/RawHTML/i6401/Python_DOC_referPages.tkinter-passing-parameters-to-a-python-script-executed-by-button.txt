<p>I have a python script that I execute from the command line, and I pass to it some parameters from there as well. <br/>
Now I'm designing the GUI to execute that script, so I want to execute the script after clicking a button, and passing the arguments from a <code>Listbox</code>. <br/> 
I have seen some suggestions that used <code>lambda</code> functions. However, I couldn't find any example of executing a whole different script that takes arguments from command line basically. <br/>
I also tried <code>ecevfile</code>, but it executes the script without taking any parameters. <br/>
How can I execute the script by a button press and passing the arguments as well? </p>

<p>Just an idea but you could write a function to make a batch file and use <code>os.startfile("batch.bat")</code></p>
