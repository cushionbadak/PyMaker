<p>I am making an educational math game and want to make sure that all user inputs are valid i.e. a number.
When they enter a letter or symbol a message needs to be displayed saying "Invalid, please try again." Can anybody help me?
This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import random

counter=0
score = 0
incorrect = 0

name=input("What is your name?")
print("Hi",name,",welcome to your math quiz!")

questions = ["10*2","4-2","6+12","6*4","12-5","6+54","1*0","3-6","4+0","65-9"]
answers=["20","2","18","24",'7','60','0','-3','4','56']

idx_questions = list(enumerate(questions))
idx_answers = list(enumerate(answers))

random.shuffle(idx_questions)

counter=0
inputs = []
for idxq, question in idx_questions:
    print("Question",counter+1,":",question)
    ans = input("What is the answer? ")
    counter=counter+1

    inputs.append(ans)
    for idxa, answer in idx_answers:
        if idxq == idxa and ans == answer:
            print("Correct")
            score=score+1
            print("Correct Answers=",score)
            print("Incorrect Answers=",incorrect)

        elif idxq == idxa and ans != answer:
            print("Incorrect. The answer is", answer)
            incorrect=incorrect+1
            print("Correct Answers=",score)
            print("Incorrect Answers=",incorrect)

print("End of quiz")
print(name,"your score is",score,"out of 10")
print(score*10,"/100",score,",%")
counter=0
while counter&lt;10:
    print("Question",counter+1,": Your answer =", inputs[counter])
    counter=counter+1

<p>what you're looking for is the <code>isdigit</code> method on the string class.</p>
<p>i.e. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit</a></p>
<p>Here is a way you could request a valid number again if the user did not input a valid number:</p>
<pre><code>def get_answer():
    num_str = input("Please enter a number: ").lower()
    if (num_str.isdigit()):
        return num_str
    else:
        print("Invalid, please try again")
        return get_answer()
</code></pre>
<p>Hi Jane, the function will essentially keep asking for an input until the user enters a number. All you need to do is get your <code>ans</code> variable with the function, and you're guaranteed it will be a number. I put it all together for you below. I actually had a couple errors in my code (sorry!) that I fixed. Your working code will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import random

counter=0
score = 0
incorrect = 0

name=input("What is your name?")
print("Hi",name,",welcome to your math quiz!")

questions = ["10*2","4-2","6+12","6*4","12-5","6+54","1*0","3-6","4+0","65-9"]
answers=["20","2","18","24",'7','60','0','-3','4','56']

idx_questions = list(enumerate(questions))
idx_answers = list(enumerate(answers))

random.shuffle(idx_questions)

def get_answer():
    num_str = input("Please enter a number: ").lower()
    if (num_str.isdigit()):
        return num_str
    else:
        print("Invalid, please try again")
        return get_answer()

counter=0
inputs = []
for idxq, question in idx_questions:
    print("Question",counter+1,":",question)
    ans = get_answer()
    counter=counter+1

    inputs.append(ans)
    for idxa, answer in idx_answers:
        if idxq == idxa and ans == answer:
            print("Correct")
            score=score+1
            print("Correct Answers=",score)
            print("Incorrect Answers=",incorrect)

        elif idxq == idxa and ans != answer:
            print("Incorrect. The answer is", answer)
            incorrect=incorrect+1
            print("Correct Answers=",score)
            print("Incorrect Answers=",incorrect)

print("End of quiz")
print(name,"your score is",score,"out of 10")
print(score*10,"/100",score,",%")
counter=0
while counter&lt;10:
    print("Question",counter+1,": Your answer =", inputs[counter])
    counter=counter+1

<p><code>isdigit()</code> checks if the string consists of digits. 
You can find it here in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Docs</a>. </p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<pre><code>string1 = '1234'
string.isdigit()
</code></pre>
<p>This returns as True.</p>
<pre><code>string2 = 'abcd'
string.isdigit()
</code></pre>
<p>This returns as False.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I am new to python so am not sure where exactly I put that into my current code to get it to work. I have tried it in a few places with no luck</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hey @Jane, updated the answer. lmk if that helps</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Legend! Thank you so much!</span>
