<p>I'm using SublimeText 3. I installed SublimeREPL to run my current Python file so I could see returns on inputs on simple practice exercises. Here's my ridiculously simple code:</p>
<pre><code>name = input("What is your name: ")
print name
</code></pre>
<p>I went to test it out and I am getting the following error:</p>
<pre><code>    What is your name: Justin
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "Practice Exercise 1.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
        name = input("What is your name: ")
      File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    NameError: name 'Justin' is not defined

***Repl Closed***
</code></pre>
<p>Seems like it wants to think of "Justin" as a function or something. If you guys could help me out, that'd be great.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need your input to be in quotes... i.e. What is your name: "Justin"</p>
<p>See here as an example <a href="https://www.python-course.eu/input.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.python-course.eu/input.php</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Seems like you are running <code>Python2</code>. In which case, change <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input()</code></a> to <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#raw_input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>raw_input()</code></a>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you're using python 3, <code>print</code> is a function and must be called using parenthesis.</p>
<pre><code>print(name)
</code></pre>

<p>Seems youâ€™re using python 2. You should probably be using python 3 unless you have a reason (eg: backwards compatibility). In python 2, <code>input()</code> interprets the input so you probably want to use <code>raw_input()</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>name = raw_input("What is your name: ")
print name
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">maybe you are running python 2? try changing <code>input</code> to <code>raw_input</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This solved it for me. I appreciate it a lot. I thought (after posting) that I could write for the input to be a string and that would return it as a string; but, quotes. Do the quotes only return the input as a string instead of wanting to read Justin as a function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes I mean when putting it in from the console to type "Justin" in quotes.  The link I posted shows the exact error he has above "If you don't wrap your name into quotes, Python takes your name as a variable"...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Technically you should just use raw_input...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for that. I made that change. Didn't solve my issue, but I definitely appreciate the help to the right step.</span>
