<p>I've got the following problem:
I have N workers. Each of them can be assigned to one of 4 tasks T1, T2, T3 and T4. I would like to generate a list with all the assignment possibilities like this:</p>
<pre><code>W1-&gt;T1, W2-&gt;T1, ... Wx-&gt;T1  
W1-&gt;T1, W2-&gt;T1, ... Wx-&gt;T2  
W1-&gt;T1, W2-&gt;T2, ... Wx-&gt;T2  
...  
W1-&gt;T4, W2-&gt;T4, ... Wx-&gt;T4
</code></pre>
<p>How can I do this? Python or VB.NET code would be the best, but any language will do.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do this:</p>
<pre><code>import itertools

def show_assignments(workers, tasks):
    prod = itertools.product(*[range(tasks)]*workers)
    for a in prod:
        print(", ".join("W%d-&gt;T%d" % (w+1, t+1) for (w, t) in enumerate(a)))
</code></pre>
<p>You can call it, for instance, as:</p>
<pre><code>show_assignments(5, 4)
</code></pre>
<p>This will display the results as:</p>
<pre><code>W1-&gt;T1, W2-&gt;T1, W3-&gt;T1, W4-&gt;T1, W5-&gt;T1
W1-&gt;T1, W2-&gt;T1, W3-&gt;T1, W4-&gt;T1, W5-&gt;T2
...
W1-&gt;T4, W2-&gt;T4, W3-&gt;T4, W4-&gt;T4, W5-&gt;T3
W1-&gt;T4, W2-&gt;T4, W3-&gt;T4, W4-&gt;T4, W5-&gt;T4
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can make the code better. But for an example this will work (python 3.6)</p>
<pre><code>workers = ["W1","W2","W3","W4","W5"] #workers
tasks = ["T1","T2","T3","T4"] #tasks
for worker in workers:
    for task in tasks:
        print(worker + " &gt;&gt; " + task)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You want to generate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Cartesian Product</a> of the pool of workers and the pool of tasks.</p>
<p>There's a standard function for this: 
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python2</a>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python3</a></p>
<p>So perhaps you need <code>itertools.product(workers, tasks)</code>?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@Plutonix Hey thanks for that. Will go back and read the help under a cloud of irony ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NiallCosgrove I do not think they are documented anywhere, but they are mentioned on meta</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Found them thanks. <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/92060/add-data-se-style-magic-links-to-comments" title="add data se style magic links to comments">meta.stackexchange.com/questions/92060/â€¦</a>  has the full list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems usable, I like it, but I don't know if I understand it right. Could you give me an example where I've got 6 workers and 4 tasks, so I can understand what is what?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, I updated it to produce the specific result you were looking for.  The example I gave has 5 workers and 4 tasks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I assume that's what you were looking for.  Let me know if you have any questions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yup, that's it! I've wrote that code for 5 workers and 4 tasks and it produced exactly what I've expected - 1024 rows of unique assignment possibilities. Thanks a lot!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If I understand it right, it will generate something like a list of all workers with all assignments, but not a combination of worker assignment with other workers assignments. Am I right? If yes, then it's not an answer I'm looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">According to documentation: product('ABCD', 'xy') --&gt; Ax Ay Bx By Cx Cy Dx Dy. I need a list of all combinations of assignments not only a list of any worker to any assignment. It won't produce output I need.</span>
