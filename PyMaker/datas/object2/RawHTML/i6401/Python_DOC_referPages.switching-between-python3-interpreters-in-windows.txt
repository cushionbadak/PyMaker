<p>I have been using python 34 and use pip from command line in windows to install my packages. Now I have installed python 36 without uninstalling python 34. However I cannot install packages into python 36 using pip as it is configured to Python 34. Any elegant solutions for this problem.</p>

<p>use this command to specify which python version you want to install packages too. Just replace 'SomePackage' with the package name you want to install.</p>
<pre><code> py -3.6 -m pip install SomePackage
</code></pre>
<p>I found this on this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here</a></p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
This is for Windows. For Mac or Linux users switch <code>py -3.6</code> to <code>python3.6</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">This should do the trick : py -3.6 -m pip install SomePackage</span>
