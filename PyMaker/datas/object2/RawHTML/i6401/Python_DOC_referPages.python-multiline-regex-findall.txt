<p>I'm trying to find multiple matches across multiple lines of text with a delimiter to stop the search using regex in python... my query works well for what I'm trying to accomplish if what I need is all on the same line: 
re.findall('([a-zA-Z]{3}\d-[aAeE][rRsS]\d.*), output)</p>
<p>the problem is, sometimes the additional data I'm trying to capture doesn't fit on the same line and goes to the next... is there a way to set the pattern match to stop if it either finds the next match or hits a delimiter (= in this case)?  Simplified example with two matches below, and I need the ability to capture both...</p>
<p>Example</p>
<pre><code>Port Id Description
3/2/4 Part of aggregate interface lag-4. Next device in path sea1-as2
lag-4, sea1-as2 3/1/2.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It seems that all you have to do is to add <code>[\s\S]*?</code> to capture whatever coming in the next line and include the expected stops <code>, | .</code> to stop the match. Note that it is important to make <code>[\s\S]*?</code> lazy, otherwise, it will match the whole thing.</p>
<pre><code>print(re.findall(r'([a-zA-Z]{3}\d-[aAeE][rRsS]\d[\s\S]*?\d)(?:,|\.)', output))
</code></pre>
<p>output</p>
<pre><code>['sea1-as2 lag-4', 'sea1-as2 3/1/2']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You mentioned <code>[a-zA-Z]</code> and <code>[aAeE][rRsS]</code>. There are several ways to set
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re.IGNORECASE</a> so that <code>[ae][rs]</code> would suffice.</p>
<p>You didn't make it clear if you're using <code>re.MULTILINE</code> or if you're deleting newlines before evaluating the regex. You end with <code>.*</code> which could trivially become</p>
<pre><code>[^=]*
</code></pre>
<p>if you want everything up to the <code>=</code> delimiter.</p>
<p>Alternatively, before evaluating the regex you could split on <code>\n</code> newline and <code>=</code> equal, so you hand in appropriate size chunks for evaluation.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What are the correct matches for the example that you've provided? are they <code>sea1-as2</code> and the second <code>sea1-as2</code> without <code>3/1/2</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry for the poor formatting (didn't realize it would change the way I posted), but 1 line has sea1-as2 with the next line having lag-4, then sea1-as2 3/1/2.  I was hoping to capture the 2 sets sea1-as2 lag-4 and sea1-as2 3/1/2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The formatting you're looking for is 4 blanks before start of each line. Then it is formatted as "code", as &lt;pre&gt;.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">captured exactly what I needed, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it is my pleasure</span>
