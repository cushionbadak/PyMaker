<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am using a nested list which contains various types of crimes. To clarify, <code>crimeDescription</code> is formatted as such: 
<code>[['Murder'], ['Assault'], ... , ['Stalking'], ['Rape']]</code>. I am looking to create a dictionary that will hold every value/crime that is in this list and record its frequency, or how often it appears in the data set. Since the keys inside dictionaries can't be lists, I am attempting to access the string inside of each nested list, by calling its index i[0] in the for loop. When I run the following program:</p>
<pre><code>#TypesOfCrime --&gt; a List containing all different types of crime that's happened in LA

TypesOfCrime = []
CrimeFreq = {}
for i in crimeDescription: 
    if i not in TypesOfCrime:
        i = i[0]
        CrimeFreq[i] = 1
    elif i in TypesOfCrime:
        i = i[0]
        CrimeFreq[i] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-75-a8698e79e96a&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
      5     if i not in TypesOfCrime:
      6         TypesOfCrime.append(i)
----&gt; 7         CrimeFreq[i[0]] = 1
      8     elif i in TypesOfCrime:
      9         CrimeFreq[i[0]] += 1

TypeError: 'float' object is not subscriptable
</code></pre>
<p>What am I doing wrong? How can I create a dictionary containing each different value that is in my nested list? Any advice will be helpful.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To count something with a dict, check if the key already exists and then increment the value, otherwise add the key with value 1:</p>
<pre><code>crime_freq = {}

for current_crime in crimeDescription:
    crime = current_crime[0]
    if crime in crime_freq:
        crime_freq[crime] += 1
    else:
        crime_freq[crime] = 1
</code></pre>
<p>The modern way to solve your problem is to use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> and a generator expression:</p>
<pre><code>crime_freq = collections.Counter(crime[0] for crime in crimeDescription)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do you want to if key not existence, created value OR if key existence, add value.</p>
<p>I recommendation using setdefault() method.</p>
<pre><code>crime_freq = {}

for current_crime in crimeDescription:
    crime = current_crime[0]
    crime_freq.setdefault(crime, 0)
    crime_freq[crime] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>If using setdefault() method, code is simple.</p>
<p>I usually using setdefault() method frequently.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Um, is there any good reason you have a list of single-element lists? Also, that error message is not consistent with the example code. Please provide a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga That is just how I received the data set. I would love to mutate the content in any way that would be helpful, and that is what I am trying to do in the if statements, but getting this TypeError... any ideas?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is <code>crimeDescription</code>, is it just a string describing each <code>TypesOfCrime</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@downshift crimeDescription is a nested list containing the various types of crime, formatted like: [['Murder'], ['Assault'], ... , ['Stalking'], ['Rape']]. Therefore, crimeDescription[0][0] == 'Murder' . Hope that clarifies my question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, look at the <code>defaultdict</code> in the <code>collections</code> module to simplify your code.</span>
