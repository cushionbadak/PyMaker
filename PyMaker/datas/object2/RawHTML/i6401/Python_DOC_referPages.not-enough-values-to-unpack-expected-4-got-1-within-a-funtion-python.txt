<p>I am new to python so I don't understand the Error I keep getting. I hope someone can explain. If you need any more information I'll edit it in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>email,fname,sname,password=line.split(", ")#splits each line however creates an extra space between the lines because of enter</p>
<p>ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 1)</p>

<p>I want it print like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>email@abc.org.uk Name Surname fakepassword</p>
<p>check@email.org.uk Z Y fakepassword</p>
<p>testing@the.program Ray Check hello</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit: I've tried to remove the space between after the comma and tried to .split("\n") but got</p>
<blockquote>
<p>email,fname,sname,password=line.split("\n")#splits each line however creates an extra space between the lines because of enter</p>
<p>ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 2)</p>

<p>At least I got one more value XD</p>

<p>Rather than re-implementing a csv reader, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv module</a> from Python's standard library.</p>
<p>Example copied from the documentation:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import csv
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('eggs.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
...     spamreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ', quotechar='|')
...     for row in spamreader:
...         print(', '.join(row))
Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam, Baked Beans
Spam, Lovely Spam, Wonderful Spam
</code></pre>
<p>This shows the canonical way to read a CSV file. Note that the <code>csv.reader</code> yields a list of strings for each iteration, so you don't have to split it.</p>
<p>You can test the length of the line before splitting it:</p>
<pre><code>for row in Y11reader:
    ll = len(row)
    if ll != 4:
        logging.warning('invalid row of {} items'.format(ll))
        continue  # skip to next iteration.
    email, fname, sname, password = row
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is your input. You need to make sure that each line in your input has all these 4 characteristics, and they are always delimited by a comma. </p>
<p>This error occurs when the number of values on the right side on the equation do not match the number of variables on the right side. An example would be:</p>
<p>The following works as the line is split into a list of 4 elements</p>
<pre><code>line = "1,2,3,4"
line_list = line.split(',') #Looks like [1,2,3,4]
first, second, third, fourth = line.split(',') #Each element is assigned to each variable
</code></pre>
<p>But the following does not work</p>
<pre><code>line = "1,2,3"
line_list = line.split(',') #Looks like [1,2,3]
first, second, third, fourth = line.split(',') 
</code></pre>
<p>There is no one to one mapping of elements to the variables. Hence, the interpreter will throw an error saying <code>not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 3)</code>. As 4 values were expected in list (as there are 4 variables on the left side of the equation, but only 3 were provided.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">that's because your file line doesn't have any commas. btw you should use the <code>csv</code> module to read csv files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or there are commas... just no commas with a space after them... :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah. csv module <i>forever</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or maybe replace ...split(", ")... with ...split(",") without space</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I now get a different error  now it says I have too many values to unpack when I tried split(",")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the logging.warning() variable comes out as an error, I was wondering if you knew why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ray You have to import the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>logging</code></a> module to use it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've tried to correct the input but now my program says that there are more items to unpack than expected, could you help explain why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you share some sample input?</span>
