<p>I am trying to write code that will accept a filename from the command line and
 print out the following properties: </p>

<li>number of lines</li>
<li>number of characters</li>
<li>number of words</li>
<li>number of “the”</li>
<li>number of “a/an"</li>
</ul>
<p>I keep getting the error message</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"argument of type 'int' is not iterable" </p>

<p>for the line <code>if 'the' in words:</code>. </p>
<p>How do I fix this?  </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are trying to collect the actual words, rather than just the count of them, then perhaps you need to initialize words to an empty list:</p>
<pre><code>words = []
</code></pre>
<p>and change</p>
<pre><code>words += len(line.split())

<p>to</p>
