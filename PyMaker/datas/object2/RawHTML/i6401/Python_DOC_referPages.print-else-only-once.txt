<p>how do I get my else print to only print once instead of for every row that the string doesn't exist? I tried moving it around by tabbing back a couple of layers but it doesn't work. I understand the logic, I but don't know how to limit it. I'm adding a little bit at a time to my parsing scripts for practice, learning as I go, but this one got me. Thanks!</p>
<pre><code>import csv
# Testing finding something specifical in a CSV, with and else
testpath = 'C:\Users\Devin\Downloads\users.csv'
developer = "devin"

with open (testpath, 'r') as testf:
    testr = csv.reader(testf)
    for row in testr:
        for field in row:
            if developer in row:
                print row
        else:
            print developer +  " does not exist!"
</code></pre>

<p>In Python, you can have an <code>else</code> clause attached to your <code>for</code> loop. For example</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(10):
...     if i == 5: break # this causes the else statement to be skipped
... else:
...     print 'not found'
...
</code></pre>
<p>Note <code>5</code> was found so the else statement is not executed</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(10):
...     if i == 15: break
... else:
...     print 'not found'
...
not found
</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation on for statements</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A break statement executed in the first suite terminates the loop
  without executing the else clause’s suite. A continue statement
  executed in the first suite skips the rest of the suite and continues
  with the next item, or with the else clause if there is no next item.</p>

<p>See Gibson's answer first. You can do this:</p>
<pre><code>for row in testr:
    found = False
    for field in row:
        if developer in row:
            print row
            found = True
            break
    if found: break
else:
    print developer +  " does not exist!"
</code></pre>
<p>You can also omit the <code>found</code> flag (as suggested by <em>Jean-François Fabre</em> in the comment) but this makes a bit hard to understand imo (I had to compile in my head):</p>
<pre><code>for row in testr:       
    for field in row:
        if developer in row:
            print row
            # We found the developer. break from the inner loop.
            break
    else:
        # This means, the inner loop ran fully, developer was not found.
        # But, we have other rows; we need to find more.
        continue
    # This means, the else part of the inner loop did not execute.
    # And that indicates, developer was found. break from the outer loop.
    break
else:
    # The outer loop ran fully and was not broken
    # This means, developer was not found.
    print developer, "does not exist!"
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Should that be <code>if developer in field:</code> in your code? (not <code>in row:</code>)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What a valuable information. Never knew this!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Raymond Hettinger suggested <code>nobreak</code> keyword to be introduced, however the proposal never got through... more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0go#t=17m12s" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mentalita thanks for the link. I agree that it's a bit confusing in it's current implementation</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @PeterGibson! Break is what I was looking for, make sense. I wonder why my question was voted down, the thread they claimed answered my question doesn't answer my question...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the <code>found</code> flag isn't useful. You could use the <code>else</code> trick in the inner loop too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">True. Answer updated. Thanks.</span>
