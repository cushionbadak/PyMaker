<p>I do not understand how the dictionary "count" is being being populated and referenced by 'List'.</p>
<p>Specifically, why do items in the list ('List') get added to the dictionary ('count') with the "if item in count" statement? </p>
<p>The 'count' dictionary is empty to begin with and there is no 'append' function.</p>
<p>Here is the python function:</p>
<pre><code>def countDuplicates(List):
    count = {}
    for item in List:
        if item in count:
            count[item] += 1
        else:
            count[item] = 1
    return count

print(countDuplicates([1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5]))
</code></pre>
<p>output: <code>{1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1}</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can run your code by hand to see how it works</p>
<pre><code>count = {} // empty dict
</code></pre>
<p>iterating through list first element is 1 it checks the dict in this line to see is this element added to the dict before </p>
<pre><code>if item in count:
</code></pre>
<p>it's not in the count so it puts the element to the list and makes its value 1 in this line </p>
<pre><code> count[item] = 1 //This appends the item to the dict as a key and puts value of 1
</code></pre>
<p>count becomes</p>
<pre><code>count ={{1:1}}
</code></pre>
<p>then it iterates through the next element witch is 2 same story count becomes </p>
<pre><code>count={{1:1},{2:1}}
</code></pre>
<p>next item is 4 </p>
<pre><code>count = {{1:1},{2:1},{4,1}}
</code></pre>
<p>next item is 2 in this case we have 2 in our dict so it increases it's value by 1 in this line</p>
<pre><code>     count[item] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>count becomes </p>
<pre><code>count = {{1:1},{2:2},{4,1}}
</code></pre>
<p>and it continues until the list is finished</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is why it checks <code>if item in count</code>, which will fail if this is the first time you are seeing the count (since it won't be defined in the dictionary yet).</p>
<p>In that case, it will define it using <code>count[item] = 1</code>. </p>
<p>The next time the count is seen, it will already have been defined (as 1), so you can increment it using <code>count[item] += 1</code>, i.e. <code>count[item] = count[item] + 1</code>, i.e. <code>count[item] = 1 + 1</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Specifically, why do items in the list ('List') get added to the dictionary ('count') with the "if item in count" statement?
<pre><code>
`checking if the element already added in to dictionary, if existing increment the value associated with item.
Example:
[1,2,4,3,2,2,5]
dict[item]  = 1  value is '1'--&gt; Else block, key '1'(item) is not there in the dict, add to and increment the occurrence by '1'</code></pre></p>
<p>when the element in list[1,2,4,3,2,2,5] is already present in the dict
count[item] += 1 --&gt; increment the occurrence against each item`

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to SO. Please take the time to read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a> and the links it contains.

<span class="comment-copy">I think the question is clear. The 2nd paragraph asks what <code>in</code> does, and the 3rd paragraph asks how to add stuff to a <code>dict</code> without <code>append</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python has the in-built <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter()</code></a> to achieve the same task</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Alper First Kaya! This is exactly the explanation/walk-through I was looking for!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What I want to tell you is that you're not alone :P <code>from collections import Counter; duplicates = Counter([1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 2, 5])</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @slackmart. The 'collections' library would definitely work in this case as well. I posted this question to understand the assignment of items from a list into a dictionary with an if statement. Definitely fundamental, but a worthwhile programming lesson.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! Now it makes sense! The "if item in count" will fail the first time and assign the [count] with an 'item' from List with 'else: count[item]' for the first time a unique item from List is first encountered.</span>
