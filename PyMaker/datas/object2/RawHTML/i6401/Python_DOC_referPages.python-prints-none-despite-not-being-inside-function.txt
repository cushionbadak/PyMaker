<p>So I'm still relatively new to Python programming and so at the moment I'm just trying to create a simple password program. If the use has opened the program before, then it will skip the create a password bit. I have done this by creating a file which will contain the number of times the file has been opened. If the number is less than 1 then it will ask for the new password. </p>
<p>This bit works fine, I just have the problem that when running the following code, "None" is printed. I understand the whole function return bit but the code I'm using isn't in a function so I'm not sure why it is happening. Would really appreciate help in fixing this!</p>
<pre><code>fo = open("openNo.txt", "r")
openNo = fo.read()

if int(openNo)&lt;1:
    pw = input(print("Please enter a password: ")) #creating a new password
    pwCheck = pw
else:
    pwCheck = input(print("Please enter your password: ")) #using an existing password

fo.close()

if pwCheck == "password":
    print("Welcome!")
else:
    print("access denied")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are doing that, in fact: you are passing the result of <code>print</code> to <code>input</code>. There's no need to do that.</p>
<pre><code>pw = input("Please enter a password: ")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>print("Please enter a password: ") returns none so you are seeing none when you run the code
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>input</code> prints the argument passed to it as a prompt; in this case, <code>None</code>, the return value from <code>print</code>. Just do e.g. <code>input("Please enter a password: ")</code>.

<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe Ah thanks a lot. Also that's useful to know there is an automatic password module. Though this was more of an exercise using a combination of different things but I'll keep that in mind!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TobyKing I think you're misunderstanding, the <code>input</code> function is defined as <code>input(prompt=None, /)</code>-- basically meaning that whenever you call <code>input</code> with a parameter, it'll implicitly print that parameter. If you want modules to actually handle passwords I would use <code>getpass</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@клйкбаутоьмажазвайкукас Thanks for the answer, but once again this is just a short exercise, I'm not actually dealing with passwords, it was potentially a bad example however</span>
