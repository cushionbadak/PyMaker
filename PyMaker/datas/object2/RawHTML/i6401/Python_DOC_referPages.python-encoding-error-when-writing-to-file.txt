<p>I want write some strings to file which is not in English, they are in Azeri language. Even if I do utf-8 encoding I get following error: </p>
<pre><code>UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 10-12: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>
<p>my code piece that wants to write to file is following:</p>
<pre><code>        t_w = text_list[y].encode('utf-8')
        new_file.write(t_w.decode('utf-8'))
        new_file.write('\n')
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT </p>
<p>Even if I make code as:</p>
<pre><code>        t_w = text_list[y].encode('ascii',errors='ignore')
        new_file.write(t_w)
        new_file.write('\n')
</code></pre>
<p>I get following error which is :</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: write() argument must be str, not bytes
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From what I can tell <code>t_w.decode(...)</code> attempts to convert your characters to ASCII, which doesn't encode some Azeri characters. There is no need to decode the string because you want to write it to the file as UTF-8, so omit the <code>.decode(...)</code> part:<code>new_file.write(t_w)</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't decode while writing in file. Just use new_file.write(t_w). Decode while reading from file like <code>file.read().decode('utf-8')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">then I get following error: TypeError: write() argument must be str, not bytes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're ok with losing data you can set <code>.encode('ascii', errors='ignore')</code>. You can read more about it <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#the-string-type" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here in the documentation</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IsmailKerimov open file in binary mode.  <code>open('abc.txt', 'wb')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dheerendra I am also writing another things as int string to file so that i cannot make all of them bytes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edited my answer you can see what happens when i make it as you said</span>
