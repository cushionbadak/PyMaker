<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Basically I want my python code to be able to read the line I have in my .txt file and print it out in another file when called.</p>
<p>What I have tried:</p>
<pre><code>var = open("Test.txt")
print(var)
</code></pre>
<p>I have also tried using readlines():</p>
<pre><code>var = open("Test.txt")
abcd = var.readlines()
print(abcd)
</code></pre>
<p>And what I get when I use that:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name='Test.txt' mode='r' encoding='US-ASCII'&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Start with a context manager, what does this get you?</p>
<pre><code>with open('Test.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()

print (content)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you are printing is only the object reference of the file and not the actual text within it. When printing out the content of a file in python you must use the <code>read()</code> function to return the content of the file. You should also specify the actions you want to take with the file in the <code>open()</code> function. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>r</code> is read</li>
<li><code>w</code> is write</li>
<li><code>r+</code> is read and write</li>
</ul>
<p>For your situation you would use:</p>
<pre><code>    var = open('Test.txt', 'r')
    content = var.read()
    print(content) 
</code></pre>
<p>This would return the entire content of the file. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">the result of abcd should be a list of strings. The TextIOWrapper is the the value of var. Please check out the docs for more info on TextIO <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You would normally use <code>var = open("Test.txt").readlines()</code> then <code>print(var[0])</code> to print the first line.  The stack trace you posted is incomplete.   If you post the rest you are more likely to get help.  Here is the documentation for <code>readlines()</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/tutorial/â€¦</a></span>

<span class="comment-copy">Either something is wrong with your file or you need to reinstall Python and try again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks you answer worked! Re-installed python and got rid of the error. Thanks heaps!</span>
