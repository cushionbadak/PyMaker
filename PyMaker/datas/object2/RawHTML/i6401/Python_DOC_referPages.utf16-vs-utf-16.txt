<p>Which line from below is correct? I do know all these available encodings? </p>

<p>Interesting question. I did some searching and it looks like you can find all of the options available here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings</a></p>
<p>so in this case, neither! It should be <code>utf_16</code>. Still, with my experience with python, I wouldn't be surprised if they sanitized the arg you provided so that it would work regardless. And from the link, it looks like they do! so <code>utf-16</code> should be a valid alias.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that spelling alternatives that only differ in case or use a hyphen instead of an underscore are also valid aliases; therefore, e.g. 'utf-8' is a valid alias for the 'utf_8' codec</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edit - that is definitely the correct link.
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#open</a> which is the documentation for <code>open</code> links you to it in this sentence </p>
<blockquote>
<p>See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings.</p>
