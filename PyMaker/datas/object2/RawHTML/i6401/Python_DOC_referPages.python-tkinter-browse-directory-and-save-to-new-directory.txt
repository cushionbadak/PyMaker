<p>First of all, the imports needed for this answer:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import tkinter as tk # if using Python 3
import Tkinter as tk # if using Python 2
</code></pre>
<p>Let's say that your button has been defined.</p>
<p>Here is some sample code which will get the current directory:</p>
<pre><code>curr_directory = os.getcwd() # will get current working directory
</code></pre>
<p>If you're looking to set up a GUI to ask the user to select a file, use:</p>
<pre><code>name = tkinter.tkFileDialog.askopenfilename(initialdir = curr_directory,title = "Select file",filetypes = (("jpeg files","*.jpg"),("all files","*.*")))
print(name)
</code></pre>
<p>Which will store the file that they have chosen, with the directory they start at set to <code>curr_directory</code> which is the current directory.</p>
<p>If you are instead looking to set up a GUI in which the user chooses a directory, you can use:</p>
<pre><code>dir_name = tk.tkFileDialog.askdirectory()
</code></pre>
<p>This will store the name of the directory they have chosen in the <code>dir_name</code> variable.</p>
