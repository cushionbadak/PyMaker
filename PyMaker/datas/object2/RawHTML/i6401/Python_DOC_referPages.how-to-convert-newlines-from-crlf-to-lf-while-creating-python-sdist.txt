<p>I'd like to use Windows as my main development platform, but at the same time generate sdist tarballs with LF newlines.</p>
<p>Is there a way to keep CRLF-s in my working directory and turn them automatically to LF-s while doing <code>python setup.py sdist</code> ?</p>
<p>Where are all <code>sdist</code> options documented?</p>
</div>

<p>No, there is no simple way to do it. You have to write some code and I'm not sure it'd be easy.</p>
<p><code>sdist</code> is a command of <code>distutils</code> and documented at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/sourcedist.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/sourcedist.html</a></p>
