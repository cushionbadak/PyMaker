<p>Well I have a file containing unicode "û". This is however not read correctly as shown in the following test case:</p>
<pre><code>print("û")
with open(r"testfile.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>Which outputs:</p>
<pre><code>û
Ã»
</code></pre>
<p>The IDE can correctly display the character - yet from reading the file another character is shown.
If I execute it in the debugger I see that <code>f</code> has as "encoding" cp1252. Not unicode.</p>
<p>So how would I "fix" this?</p>
<p>Opening the file in notepad++ tells me the file really is UTF-8. If I manually change the file to be windows-codepage 1252 it seems to work. But that's not really what I want.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can specify the encoding when opening the file:</p>
<pre><code>with open(r"testfile.txt", encoding='utf-8') as f:
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You will need to use the encoding parameter as "utf-8", while opening the file.
that looks like below along with the with open().
You may want to read up on this more <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>
<pre><code>  encoding='utf-8'

<span class="comment-copy">Per default <code>open</code> uses the encoding returned by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html#locale.getpreferredencoding" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>locale.getpreferredencoding</code></a> which basically defaults to cp1252 on windows.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">TypeError: 'encoding' is an invalid keyword argument for this function.  Can I ask what version of Python you are using?  Is this a Python 3 thing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes I think so.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, thanks.  I guess I'll have to use the codecs library then.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">:D Python3 is calling you...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Lol.  The newer sites that I maintain use it.  Just not the one that I am working on now.  Eventually, the day will come.</span>
