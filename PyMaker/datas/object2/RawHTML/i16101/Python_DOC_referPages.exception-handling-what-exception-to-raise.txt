<p>I am writing a python function that accepts certain parameters. I would like to make sure one of the parameter's value is a string of specific custom format. If it doesn't match the format I would like to raise an exception. Is it appropriate to raise one of the built-in exception and if yes which one?</p>
<p>I looked here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#</a> but couldn't pin down to a specific one.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As long as it provides a detailed and explicit error message, you can use a built-in one -  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ValueError</code></a>, for example, looks logical here.</p>
<p>Another option would be to create a custom one:</p>
<pre><code>class InvalidFormatError(ValueError):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>There are relevant threads on SO that, I hope, would help you to decide which option to choose:</p>

<p>What you describe sounds like a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError" rel="nofollow">ValueError</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value, and the situation is not described by a more precise exception such as IndexError.</p>

<p>That it is raised by built in functions doesn't mean you can't <code>raise</code> it too.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you create a custom exception class, it should probably still be a subclass of ValueError for this use case (not just a direct subclass of <code>Exception</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BrenBarn good point, I agree.</span>
