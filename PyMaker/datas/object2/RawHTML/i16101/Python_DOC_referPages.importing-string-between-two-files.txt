<p>It seems I don't quite understand the import function. I would want to do it two way.</p>
<p>file1:</p>
<pre><code>filename="tt.txt"
import file2
from file imort fileContent
</code></pre>
<p>file2:</p>
<pre><code>from file1 import filename
fileContent=whats in the filename
</code></pre>
<p>That's approximately what I want to do, but it never gets the file name to file2. </p>

<p>It seems to be your first time with Python, and perhaps programming, so I'll advise you to ask questions on StackOverflow about a particular incident, providing as many details as possible, and to always include all code you've written.</p>
<p>Regardless,
Python's import statement is a utility that allows one module access to another. So for example, if I defined a file general.py as so:</p>
<pre><code>def print_hello_world():
    print "Hello World Stack Overflow!"
</code></pre>
<p>and in any other file, included the code:</p>
<pre><code>import general
general.print_hello_world
</code></pre>
<p>would give the output "Hello World Stack Overflow!"</p>
<p>Also, here's a reference guide to imports: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html</a></p>

<p>What you have here is a circular import. file1 imports file2:</p>
<pre><code>import file2
</code></pre>
<p>and file2 imports file1:</p>
<pre><code>from file1 import filename
</code></pre>
<p>This is a no-no. file1 tells Python to import file2, which tells Python to import file1, which tells Python to import file2... etc.</p>
<p>What exactly happens when you run this code? Are you getting an <code>ImportError: cannot import name &lt;blah&gt;</code>? Is there any reason the code needs to be in two separate files, or could it be combined into one?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There's your problem: <code>imort</code> isn't valid Python code, and neither is <code>whats in the filename</code>. Fix those and your syntax errors should go away.</span>
