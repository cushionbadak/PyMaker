<p>I am using IDLE GUI
I created a file called <em>doss.py</em> and it is saved in C:\python34</p>
<p>now on IDLE (GUI)</p>
<p>i want that doss.py to open without any RUN command. 
in python27 i used </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import doss.py 
</code></pre>
<p>it worked very fine </p>
<p>bt idk why its showing some LOC in red color.</p>
<p>its :</p>

<p>You don't have a module called <code>doss.py</code>. Your module, if stored in a file named <code>doss.py</code>, is named <code>doss</code>. So try <code>import doss</code>.</p>
<p><code>doss.py</code> would be a submodule of <code>doss</code> named <code>py</code>.</p>

<p>I'm quite sure that <code>import doss.py</code> would <strong>not</strong> have worked in Python 2.7's standard shell, at least not in the way that you think. Simply put, <code>import</code>-ing a module is not equivalent to running it from the command line, except inadvertently in some cases. Also, no version of Python has ever accept filenames (e.g. <code>doss.py</code>) as the arguments to <code>import</code>; it has always been a package name (which might be <code>doss</code> if there's a file called <code>doss.py</code> in the current directory, but <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow">it gets more complicated</a>).</p>
<p>The standard Python interactive shell has never included a mechanism to do quite what you want: to load and execute a Python script roughly as if from the command line.</p>
<p>You may want to try the enhanced <a href="http://ipython.org" rel="nofollow">IPython shell</a> instead. IPython does have a <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/tutorial.html#running-and-editing" rel="nofollow"><code>%run</code> command that does what you want</a>, in addition to a number of other enhancements.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I created 1 more file called boy.py,  &gt;&gt;import boy Hello  my code execute but again am trying to run the same code its not executing.. moreover whats the problem in doss.py  i just gave the name doss.py</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My mistake , i tried   &gt;&gt;&gt; import hello  but why import doss is the error ?  the above script am getting when i execute  &gt;&gt;&gt; import doss</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at the "more complicated" link in my answer above; what <code>import</code> does is rather subtle and intricate. If you simply want to run scripts like from the command line, <code>import</code> is <b>not</b> what you want; use IPython's <code>%run</code> or just run them from the command line.</span>
