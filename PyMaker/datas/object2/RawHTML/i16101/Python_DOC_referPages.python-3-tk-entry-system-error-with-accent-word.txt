<pre><code>**__author__ = 'jordiponsisala'
from tkinter import  *

root= Tk()

entrada = StringVar()

entEntrada = Entry(root,textvariable=entrada).place(x=70,y=70)

<p>Thanks for your answer but I do not need unicode. 
<strong>Python 3 accepts unicode or latin characters without any coding.</strong> 
The problem is that mac osx python Mavericks have a problem with tkinter libraries. 
The solution is to update the version of tcl tk to 8.5.15.1 
Here I leave the address to download: 
<a href="https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/" rel="nofollow">https://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/</a> </p>
<p>For Mac users from the console to check if there is an error: 
python3 -m idlelib.idle </p>
<p>Python 3 natively install the 8.5 version of tcl tk if i put the 8.6 does not recognize. 
other method to know the version is to run this code: 
import tkinter 
tkinter._test () </p>
<p><strong>After update ActiveTcl8.5.15.1.297588-macosx10.5-i386-x86_64-threaded.dmg can this written any accent character in a text field of tkinter without problem and without coding anything.</strong></p>
<p>I feel aber asked a question that I asked maybe wrong :)</p>

<p>Sure, you must use UNICODE. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow">Python's docs</a>. There are many examples and ways to use it, but quite probably this example will be enough for you on how to declare your encoding to use in documents (UTF-( is default, but since you speak a latin language, latin-1 is probably more suitable for you):</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: latin-1 -*-

u = 'abcd√©'
print(ord(u[-1]))
</code></pre>
