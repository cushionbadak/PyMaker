<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have the following data:</p>
<pre><code>x = 2
y = 5
z = 9
a = array
</code></pre>
<p>The numbers in the array are <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code>.
I do not know how to use loops and I also do not know how to include the variables inside the loop.</p>
<p>This is my try using the for loop:</p>
<pre><code>x * y * z * a = B
For (x = 2, y = 5, z = 9, a = array, a++)
print (B)
</code></pre>
<p>What I am trying to do is get the program to print values in a table of <code>a</code> and <code>B</code>. And the calculation I am trying to attempt is something like this; for example for the first number from the array: <code>2 * 5 * 9 * 1 = 90</code>, then second number from the array: <code>2 * 5 * 9 * 2 = 180</code> and so on. I don't even know how to get the math functions into the python program. I shouldn't have to type the list in that array. That array is already printed.</p>
<p>Much appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; z = 9
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in a:
...     output = x * y * z * i
...     print x, '*', y, '*', z, '*', i, '=', output
...     
... 
2 * 5 * 9 * 1 = 90
2 * 5 * 9 * 2 = 180
2 * 5 * 9 * 3 = 270
2 * 5 * 9 * 4 = 360
2 * 5 * 9 * 5 = 450

<pre><code>In [119]: x = 2

In [120]: y = 5

In [124]: for iteration in array:

In [125]: answer
Out[125]: [90, 180, 270, 360, 450]
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you could do this a lot simpler, by computing <code>x*y*z</code> beforehand:</p>
<pre><code>mult = x*y*z
answer = []
for iteration in array:
    answer.append(mult*iteration)
</code></pre>
<p>... and you could also use a list comprehension, if you wanted to:</p>
<pre><code>answer = [mult*iteration for iteration in array]
</code></pre>
<p>... and if you didn't want to create the array:</p>
<pre><code>answer = [mult*iteration for iteration in range(1,6)]  # range(1,6) gives you a sequence of 1,2,3,4,5
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Step one would be learning <i>any Python at all</i>. <code>a = array</code> is not how you create a list (or even an array, for that matter) and is likely a <code>NameError</code>. I don't know what you think you're doing with that <code>For(...)</code>, but it's certainly not a Python <code>for</code> loop. You can't just guess.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Read a book !!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your code is missing fundamental structure that is necessary if you are going to understand for loops. I recommend this tutorial in order learn what you need. It does cover for loops. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html</a></span>
