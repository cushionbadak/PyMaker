<p>I want to print out one line like this: <code>the list is：[1,2,3]</code>
I can not make it within one line and I have to do in this way:</p>
<pre><code>print " the list is :%"
print a
</code></pre>
<p>I am wondering whether I can print out something that combine with string formatting and a list in ONE line.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The simplest way is what CodeHard_or_HardCode said in the comments. For Python 3 it would be:</p>
<pre><code>a=[1,2,3]
print('This is a list', a)

This is a list [1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I suggest using the string <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>format</code></a> method, as it is recommended over the old <code>%</code> syntax.</p>
<pre><code>print("the list is: {}".format(a))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>At least in Python 2.7.4., this will work:</p>
<pre><code>print " the list is " + str(a)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>a = [1,2,3]
print("the list is: %s" % a)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Pretty sure you just do - print "the list is:", mylist</span>
<span class="comment-copy">All you need is a comma</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>%s</code> has been deprecated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, I'm not sure that it's officially deprecated, but it's definitely discouraged.  In fact, this issue with formatting lists is directly referenced in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>: "The formatting operations described here [%] exhibit a variety of quirks that lead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and dictionaries correctly)."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I like the "".format() function for precise control, but for simple output (as OP requested), format % value is fine. Can you share a link that state's it's deprecated?</span>
