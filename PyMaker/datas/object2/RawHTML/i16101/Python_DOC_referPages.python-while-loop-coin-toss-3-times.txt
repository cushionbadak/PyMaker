<p>I am trying to create a coin toss three times using while loop, but
   there are various issues here and iam not professional yet.</p>
<p>My code didn't run the way i wanted it to run it's only a test code
   for now...here are the issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>it is not looping for some reason, runs only once.</p></li>
<li><p>it's only printing tails, never print heads.</p></li>
<li><p>i have to place the else
statement in the beginning of the line every time in order for the
program to run without giving me an invalid syntax message...why??</p></li>
<li><p>how do i make it loop 3 times exactly?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>ANY help will be appreciated. Code is below</p>
<pre><code>import random

heads_counter=0 tails_counter=0

while heads_counter and tail_counter &lt;= 3:
    a= random.randint (1,2)
    if a==1:
        print ("heads",heads_counter)
        heads_counter+=1

else:
    print ("tails",tails_counter)
    tails_counter+=1

<p>Your main problem here is:</p>
<pre><code>while heads_counter and tail_counter &lt;= 3:
</code></pre>
<p>I am assuming you'd like something more along the lines of this:</p>
<pre><code>while heads_counter + tail_counter &lt;= 3:
    a= random.randint (1,2)
    if a==1:
        print ("heads",heads_counter)
        heads_counter+=1

    else:
        print ("tails",tails_counter)
        tails_counter+=1

print ("heads total",heads_counter)
print ("tails total",tails_counter)

<p>Remember: Indentation is important in Python.</p>
<p>While loop specification: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your 'while' clause is incorrect.  The statement</p>
<pre><code>while a and b &lt;= c
</code></pre>
<p>is not evaluated as </p>
<pre><code>while (a and b) &lt;= c
</code></pre>
<p>it evaluates to:</p>
<pre><code>while (a) and (b &lt;= c)
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, a is your heads_counter variable, which is initialized to 0, hence it evaluates to false and your loop never runs</p>
<p>Also, as noted by khelwood, your indentation levels are incorrect.  Your <code>else</code> clause needs to be indented at the same level as the corresponding <code>if</code> clause</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A note on style:</p>
<p>Python has a remarkable verbosity that few other languages match. Use it! Don't do <code>while a + b &lt; 3</code>, do <code>for coinflip in range(3)</code>. Don't do <code>result = random.randint(1,2)</code> then parse <code>random</code> into heads or tails, do <code>result = random.choice("heads","tails")</code>. Heck, run it all at once in one big list and sort it later!</p>
<p>My recommendations:</p>
<pre><code>import random
results = {'heads':0, 'tails':0}
for coinflip in range(3):
    results[random.choice('heads','tails')] += 1
</code></pre>
<p>which is more simply</p>
<pre><code>import random
results = dict()
for coinflip in range(3):
    results.setdefault(random.choice('heads','tails'), 0) += 1
</code></pre>
<p>or even more simply:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
import random

Counter(random.choice('heads','tails') for flip in range(3))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to be more explicit in the <code>while</code> condition:</p>
<pre><code>while heads_counter &lt;=3 and tail_counter &lt;= 3:
</code></pre>
<p>Your code is always false, because <code>head_counter</code>, initialized to 0, is false. That is enough to make the entire <code>and</code>'d condition false.</p>
<p>(Update: as kachingy123 pointed out, you actually want to compare the <em>sum</em> of the two variables to 3. Python is more precise than English, which can use "and" as a synonym
for "plus".</p>
<pre><code>while head_counter + tail_counter &lt;= 3:
</code></pre>
<p>)</p>
<p>You also need to indent the <code>else</code> clause to match the <code>if</code>, since a <code>while</code> loop can <em>also</em> take an <code>else</code> clause (which is executed when the loop exits due to its condition being false, rather than an explicit break).</p>
<p>Finally, you need put your two variable assignments on separate lines. (You <em>could</em> just separate them with a semi-colon, but that isn't considered good practice.)</p>
<pre><code>import random

heads_counter=0
tails_counter=0

# With update from kachingy123
while heads_counter + tail_counter &lt;= 3:
    a = random.randint (1,2)
    if a==1:
        heads_counter += 1
        print ("heads",heads_counter) 
    else:
        tails_counter += 1
        print ("tails",tails_counter)

<p>Looks like an indentation problem. If your <code>else</code> clause corresponds to your <code>if</code>, then it should be at the same indentation level as it.</p>
<p>Also your while condition needs to check <code>heads_counter &lt;=3 and tail_counter &lt;= 3</code> and your initialisation for your counter variables should be separated, as chepner pointed out.</p>
<pre><code>heads_counter = 0
tails_counter = 0

while heads_counter &lt;= 3 and tail_counter &lt;= 3:
    a= random.randint (1,2)
    if a==1:
        print ("heads",heads_counter)
        heads_counter+=1
    else:
        print ("tails",tails_counter)
        tails_counter+=1
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you want to check the edit represent your <i>actual</i> code? Looked like the edit introducing <code>&gt;</code>s at the start of the code block was to try and put indentation back in for your if/else, but not 100% sure...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JonClements The <code>else</code> being indented inline with the <code>while</code> would explain why it always seemed to choose tails. (That's how it appeared when I first edited the question.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chepner yep... looking more closely at the OPs edit, it didn't introduce indentation... so I've rolled back to yours (again)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you for help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you for help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so you're saying i need three vars instead of just the a ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Even <code>(a and b) &lt;= c</code> would be wrong if it were parsed that way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, in the example a, b, c are just placeholders for whatever you use in your conditional.  I was just trying to illustrate how it evaluates the statement.  In your case <code>a</code> is <code>heads_counter</code>, <code>b</code> is <code>tails_counter</code>, and <code>c</code> is the constant you were attempting to check them against</span>
<span class="comment-copy">got you, thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chepner agreed, but it's a bit too long for a comment. Plus, code formatting and etc. The OP got plenty of duplicate responses to the issues with the code he wrote. I'm loathe to write another.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the intention from the original text stipulates only three coin flips: "I am trying to create a coin toss three times using while loop"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good point, I glossed over that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank for replying , though iam trying to have the program prints only 3 tosses and then the total but now it is including 0 in the count, here is the output iam trying to get::...   Tossing.....  tail    (  2  )  Tossing.....  tail    (  2  )  Tossing.....  head    (  1  )  1 heads and  2 tails Winner: Tails</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@aero You need to update the counters before printing their values; I'll make that change.</span>
