<p>my csv file has multiple tables in a single file for example</p>
<pre>
name age gender
n1    10  f
n2    20  m
n3    30  m
city  population 
city1   10
city2   20
city3   30
</pre>
<p>How can I print from city row to city3 row.using python csv module</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to come up with a way to detect the start and end of the relevant section of the file; the <code>csv</code> module does not contain any built-in mechanism for doing this by itself, because there is no general and unambiguous delimiter for the beginning and end of a particular section.</p>
<p>I have to question the wisdom of jamming multiple CSV files together like this. Is there a reason that you can't separate the sections into  individual files?</p>

<p>There is no proper <code>csv</code> module for the question. Alternatively, you can probably use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html" rel="nofollow"><code>re</code></a> module for regular expression match.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code>with open("file.csv") as f:
    data = f.readlines()
cities = [re.findall("(city.*)", line)[0] for line in data]
print cities
</code></pre>
<p>it should print all lines begin with keyword "city".</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@JonathanLeffler ah, I didn't look for <code>csv</code> module anytime before. But the format this question posted doesn't look like a <code>.csv</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes...CSV is an abused term.  Sometimes, as here, it would probably be better termed DSV - Delimiter-Separated Variable format.  It looks like the delimiter is probably a tab, here.  The Python CSV module can handle a number of variants on CSV format, and specifically it could handle this one â€” or, at least, either of the sections of it, but maybe not the two sections jammed together.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>csv</code> module can actual deal with many similar forms of text tables divided into rows and columns with delimiter characters... Not just those that are truly <i>comma</i>-separated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanLenski As <code>csv</code> is really a simple format, I'd just like to read them using regular expression and list comprehension.</span>
