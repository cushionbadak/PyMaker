<p>I wrote this simple script in Python:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.system("ping www.google.com")
</code></pre>
<p>It's working in interactive mode from cmd of windows, but seems it doesn't work if I write on IDLE (it appear a cmd black screen). This is the first problem.</p>
<p>The second thing that I like to do is this:
I'd like to save the results of the pings in a file 
How can I do it?</p>
<p>I'm novice of Python (two days) ;)
Thanks a lot.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can't do it with <code>os.system</code>. That's why <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs for <code>os.system</code></a> specifically say, "The subprocess module provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is preferable to using this function. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess-replacements" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>Replacing Older Functions with the subprocess Module</i></a> section in the <code>subprocess</code> documentation for some helpful recipes."</span>
