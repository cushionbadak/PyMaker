<p>I got an error at this code:
The error is in my function settings() in the Button() command. but I don't got any plan how to fix it, sorry. I can't put the 3 commands in an external function, cause it wouldn't get the variables...</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you're trying to string together multiple expressions using the <code>&amp;</code> operator, it isn't likely to work well, unless all of your function calls return integers, which isn't the case here. I don't recommend it, but you can put each command as a separate element of a collection such as a list or tuple:</p>
<pre><code>Button(tk,text="Save",command = lambda:[
    shape(str(listbox.get(ACTIVE))),
    shapesize(int(shsi.get())),
    pensize(int(trsi.get()))
]).place(x=200,y=60,width=200,height=30)
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>I can't put the 3 commands in an external function, cause it wouldn't get the variables</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ordinarily, this is true. But if you define the second function <em>inside</em> the first, all of its variables will still be visible.</p>
<pre><code>def settings():
    def save_button_clicked():
        shape(str(listbox.get(ACTIVE)))
        shapesize(int(shsi.get()))
        pensize(int(trsi.get()))
    #rest of `settings` code goes here...
    Button(tk,text="Save",command = save_button_clicked).place(x=200,y=60,width=200,height=30)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What's the specific problem? Do you get an error message, or a stack trace? What do you expect to happen? What's happening instead?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, your formatting is <i>horrendous</i>. This code is impossible to read. Have a look at <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 8</a>, Python's official style guide.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I got an error message. I wanted to change the turtles Shape, Shapesize and Pensize in one Button command. The pensize doesn't change, and an error message comes up: "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &amp;: 'NoneType' and 'NoneType'"</span>
