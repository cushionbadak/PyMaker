<p>I have a few of the pieces of this working but I'm struggling with putting them together. </p>
<p>I would like to take a file, move it to a backup folder, get the date time from that file, and append it to the file's name / change the file's name to file name + date time. </p>
<p>This part gets the date time in the format I want it. (print line is the date time formatted properly, but I don't need to print this line)</p>
<pre><code>    Filepath = "C:\\SyncWork\\ACE\\Files\\ESAL_P\\ESAL_P.txt"
    modifiedTime = os.path.getmtime(Filepath) 
    firstFile = os.path.getmtime(Filepath)

    print (datetime.fromtimestamp(modifiedTime).strftime("%b-%d-%y-%H:%M:%S"))
</code></pre>
<p>This part will rename / move the file (But it's missing the datetime) </p>
<pre><code>    prevName = 'c:\\syncwork\\ace\\files\\ESAL_P\\ESAL_P.txt'
    newName = 'c:\\syncwork\\ace\\files\\ESAL_P\\Backup\\ESAL_P.txt'

    os.rename(prevName, newName)
</code></pre>
<p>How do I turn the print line with the formatting that I like into a string and append it to the end of the newName line? </p>
<p><strong>AFTER my question was answered</strong> 
My final code looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>Filepath = "C:\\SyncWork\\ACE\\Files\\ESAL_P\\ESAL_P.txt"
modifiedTime = os.path.getmtime(Filepath) 



timestamp = datetime.fromtimestamp(modifiedTime).strftime("%b-%d-%Y_%H.%M.%S")

prevName = 'c:\\SyncWork\\ACE\\Files\\ESAL_P\\ESAL_P.txt'
newName = 'c:\\SyncWork\\ACE\\Files\\ESAL_P\\Backup\\ESAL_P' 

os.rename(prevName, newName+"_"+timestamp + ".txt")
print(newName)  
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I just tested the following on a file named "temp" which was changed to "temp_Sep-15-14-08:42:57"</p>
<pre><code>FilePath = 'temp' # replace the temp with your file path/name
modifiedTime = os.path.getmtime(FilePath) 

timeStamp =  datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(modifiedTime).strftime("%b-%d-%y-%H:%M:%S")
os.rename(FilePath,FilePath+"_"+timeStamp)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should do it:</p>
<pre><code>timestamp = (datetime.fromtimestamp(modifiedTime).strftime("%b-%d-%y-%H:%M:%S"))
newName = 'c:\\syncwork\\ace\\files\\ESAL_P\\Backup\\ESAL_P.txt.' + timestamp
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What <code>strftime</code> returns is already a string... Perhaps you should review <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">BTW, you can use <code>os.path.splitext()</code> on the original file name to split the extension off, which would allow you append the timestamp at the end of root name of the file generically (and not hardcode so many things as you're doing). Also note that the <code>print(newName)</code> <i>isn't</i> printing the new generated file name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the tip about splitting the username from the file. I know the print(newName) isn't doing anything. It's actually useless. I only really have it in there to make sure my code is doing anything at all.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like you got an extra datetime in there. Also, when I put my full path in place of yours it throws an error at me saying: OSError: [WinError 123] The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect: 'C:\\SyncWork\\ACE\\Files\\ESAL_P\\ESAL_P.txt' -&gt; 'C:\\SyncWork\\ACE\\Files\\ESAL_P\\ESAL_P.txt_Sep-09-14-09:44:40'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user1837575: The generated file name is invalid because they can't contain colon characters which have a special meaning in Windows. Try something else that's legal like <code>strftime("%b-%d-%y-%H-%M-%S")</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot. That was what was going on. As soon as I removed the colons it worked perfectly. It's strange how it acted with the other iterations I tried, sometimes throwing no errors or weird errors. Anyways, it works now and it's doing exactly what I need it to.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sixteenornumber: That's what I assumed (and why I didn't downvote your answer).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user1837575 : How are you importing datetime. You can do <code>python -c "import datetime;print datetime.datetime.now()"</code> or <code>python -c "from datetime import datetime;print datetime.now()"</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This puts the timestamp <i>after</i> the file's extension!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yep - that's what was asked for.  Don't vote me down for following the letter of the spec!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This SEEMS like what I'm looking for but it doesn't work. It doesn't throw an error either, but I get no file in my backup folder. I can't seem to figure out why. Also, I'd rather not append the date time after the file extension, rather concatenate the date time to the end of the name of the file.   I got a print(newName) at the end of the script and it returns basically what I'm looking for, but the file doesn't move to that folder.</span>
