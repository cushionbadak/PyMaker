<p>I'm trying to create a program that will allow me to enter a value in minutes and the program will output those minutes as the sum of days, hours and minutes between them.
For example if I input 10000 minutes I should get the output, "10000 minutes is 6 days, 22 hours and 40 minutes"). This is how much I have now:</p>
<pre><code>min = int(input("Enter a whole number of minutes: "))
days = min/1440
remainday = min%1440
print (days)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm only having one problem asides from it being unfinished, if the user inputs a number of minutes under 1440 then i get a decimal answer for the number of days (which is expected) but if the number of minutes is not sufficient to make a day, then I want the it to say "0 days" not ".153 days". How would I zero out the value for days in such a case?</p>

<p>You are using Python 3 so the operator <code>/</code> is <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">true division, not integer division</a>.</p>
<p>You can either use floor division which is similar to Python 2's integer division:</p>
<pre><code>days = min//1440
</code></pre>
<p>Or use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>divmod</code></a> to get both with a single command:</p>
<pre><code>days, remaindays = divmod(min,1440)
</code></pre>

<p>You can use floor division (using a double <code>//</code> instead of a single <code>/</code> when dividing), which rounds down to the nearest integer:</p>
<pre><code>min = int(input("Enter a whole number of minutes: "))
# Example input: 1000
days = min // 1440
remainday = min%1440
print (days)
# Output:
# 0
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You essentially want to round <strong>down</strong> the result of the division (quotient) to the nearest integer. 
This can be done in many ways:</p>
<pre><code>days = int(min/1440)
</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre><code>days = min//1440 # // is the integer division in Python 3, while / is float division`
</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre><code>days = math.floor(min/1440) # after importing "math" module, using "import math"
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>min</code> is a built-in function in Python.  Use a different variable name like <code>mins</code>.  <code>divmod</code> is the built-in function you want to get integer dividends and remainders.</span>
