<p>I use python in opensuse, my problem is i need to execute large data in my folder.
for example</p>
<pre><code>python myprogram.py 20140101.txt
</code></pre>
<p>i still need to run for a lot data with like that naming (20140101.txt) ex 20140204 etc..
my question is how to make my program running automatically for all data together.</p>

<p>use bash like this:</p>
<pre><code>for file in /dir/*.txt
do
    python myprogram.py $file     
done
</code></pre>

<p>For a pure python solution, have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/fileinput.html" rel="nofollow">fileinput</a>.</p>
<p>It is part of the python standard library and let's you loop over files given via standard input or via a list of files, e.g.: </p>
<pre><code>import fileinput
for line in fileinput.input():
    process(line)
</code></pre>
<p>So you could do:</p>
<pre><code>./python myprogram 2014*.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The glob module is useful for processing multiple files with different names.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A python solution would be to use "glob". It helps you creating lists of files' name based on a certain pattern. You can then loop through those filenames to execute your commands on. See example below. </p>
<pre><code>import glob

txt_files = glob.glob("201401*.txt")

for txt in txt_files:
    print txt
    my_txt_file = open(txt, "r") 
</code></pre>
