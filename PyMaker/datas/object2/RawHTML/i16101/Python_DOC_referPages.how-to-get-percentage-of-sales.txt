<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>print("Profit Predition.")

sales=input("Enter amount of sales: ")

print('Total sales: ', sales)

profit=sales* 0.21

print(format(profit, ',.2'))
</code></pre>
<p>The results I am getting for the last line should be (using an input of <code>974.58</code>, which is just the example used): </p>
<pre><code>Profit Prediction.
Enter amount of sales: 974.58
Total sales: 974.58
Expected profit: 204.66
</code></pre>
<p>but instead of the last line what I am getting is <code>2e+02</code>. I can't figure out how to make it return a "float" number. I'm very new to programming and would appreciate the help! The version of python that I am using is 3.3.5</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>UPDATE: I am so sorry for the mistakes I have made. I have updated my answer.</p>
<p>So try to replace the last line with:</p>
<pre><code>print('%.2f' % profit)
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>print("{0:.2f}".format(profit))
</code></pre>
<p>And you can get the right thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I always use <code>print</code> in this way:</p>
<pre><code>print("%.2f" % profit)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try</p>
<pre><code>print("{:,.2f}".format(profit))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Should that <code>%</code> be a <code>,</code>? Otherwise, your sample code doesn't really match what you say in the first paragraph (and the format is useless?).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Jerry, I wasn't expecting you to be so apologetic, fixing the answer (if indeed my comment was even correct) would have been more than enough. Cheers and +1.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@paxdiablo Thanks for your support.. I just hope I haven't misled others ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't that rather screw up your integers and strings? And what if the variable you're trying to print isn't called <code>profit</code>? :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The OP asked for a float number and a variable called profit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's humour, skytux, you said you <i>always</i> use <code>print</code> that way. Man does no-one even <i>see</i> the smileys nowadays?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I see it now hahaha... :-)</span>
