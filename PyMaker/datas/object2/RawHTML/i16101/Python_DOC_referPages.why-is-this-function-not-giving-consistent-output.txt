<p>I am making a tic-tac-toe AI just for fun. I made a successors function that returns a dictionary with the start state as the key, and all of the states that come immediately after as the value.</p>
<p>The function is working fine as far as I can tell(all though I still need to remove the symmetric states), but for some reason every time I run the function, the tuple of successors states is in a different order. I get the same values, but they are scrambled.</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import *

def successors(state):
    vars = [0]*state.count(0)
    vars[0] = 'x'
    vars[1] = 'o'
    vars = list(set(permutations(vars)))
    state = tuple([state[i:i+3] for i in range(0, len(state), 3)])
    states = []
    for var in vars:
        new_board = []
        for row in state:
            new_row = []
            for tile in row:
                if tile != 0:
                    new_row.append(tile)
                else:
                    new_row.append(var[0])
                    var = var[1:]
            new_board.append(tuple(new_row))
        states.append(tuple(new_board))
    return {state:states}


board = (0,0,0,
         0,0,0,
         0,0,0)

print(successors(board))

<p>Is there a variable somewhere that isn't getting reset?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is probably because you do:</p>
<pre><code>vars = list(set(permutations(vars)))
</code></pre>
<p>The order here is arbitrary and can be different from one run to the next due to hash randomization.  To disable it, you set the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONHASHSEED" rel="nofollow"><code>PYTHONHASHSEED</code></a> environment variable to a constant value -- e.g. <code>0</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Every time you run the function?  Or every time you run the program?  I'm betting it's the latter -- and I'm guessing you're running python2.7 with hash randomization enabled.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mgilson: Why 2.7? <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/3.4.html#whatsnew-pep-456" rel="nofollow noreferrer">3.4 has SipHash enabled by default</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112 -- Some reason I was thinking that it started being enabled by default at python2.7 and 3.3 (respectively).  had I noticed that OP uses <code>print</code> as a function, I wouldn't have been that specific :-/</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">3.3 has randomization enabled by default too, though not as good</a>. (I wasn't sure when that change went in. It took me a bit longer to look it up.) As far as I know, no 2.x version has it on by default.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A <code>set</code> is unordered, so when you say <code>list(set(permutations(vars)))</code> you essentially throw every assumption of orderness out of the window.</span>
