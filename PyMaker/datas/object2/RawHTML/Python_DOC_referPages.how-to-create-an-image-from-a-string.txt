<p>I'm trying to create an image file from a string, but so far I have not had any luck. Using ImageDraw I can print a string on an image file, but this is not what I intend to do. I want to generate just a simple image file from a set of characters.</p>
<p>Edit: Imagine a hypothetical case of creating an ASCII art text of a pic, but instead of creating an output of a text file, generate an image file. My code consists of multiple loops and using Matplotlib will affect my code's performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you could try matplotlib:</p>
<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.text(0,0,mystring)
plt.savefig("mysentence.png", dpi=100)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.x/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.frombytes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>PIL.Image.frombytes</code> method</a></p>
<pre><code>import PIL

my_string = b'\xf8\xff\xb0\xbc\xd8]\xba\xdf0\xbd\xdeE\xfb\xff\xd1\xf1\xff\xbf\xb4\xd9p\xad\xd9F\xae\xd7U\xf2\xff\xd6\xdf\xff\xdc\xde\xff\xd2m\xa8L\xe0\xff\xc5\xe0\xff\xe1F\x9a\\I\x9e]E\x9bTD\x9aSK\x9fa1\xadO,\xa7L3\xaeT/\xa9R.\xa8Q'
img = Image.frombytes("RGB", (5,5), my_string)
img.show()
</code></pre>
<p>Note, that the length of your string must equals the number of bytes used for a pixel multiplied by the width and height of the image.</p>
<p>In my case <code>my_string</code> holds an RGB image, that makes 3 bytes per pixel and the image is 5 pixels width and 5 pixel high.</p>
<p>Therefore <code>my_string</code> should have a length of 75 bytes (3 * 5 * 5)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is a good idea, but I think the overhead is a bit too much for my current task. I'm trying to generate images of different characters in a loop, and this might not be the best idea.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FarhoodET Please improve your question to clarify properly what you are trying to do if that is the case. Currently it doesn't mention a loop...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand how does this relate to my question. I have copied your code and added an img.save(path) line but the resulting image has a filesize of 0. BTW, my problem is to generate image of characters, not translating a series of characters into an image.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I must have misunterstood your question then. However saving works fine for me</span>
