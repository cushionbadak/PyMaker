<p>I'm trying to make a python program where 20 cars go random speeds which update every minute (set as a second right now).  It tracks the distance they drive, and the first to 500 miles wins. </p>
<p>But, I get this error when I run it: </p>
<p><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "E:\Python\NASCAR.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    class Car:
  File "E:\Python\NASCAR.py", line 10, in Car
    while miles &lt; 500.00:
TypeError: unorderable types: NoneType() &lt; float()</code></p>
<p>I'm not sure how to fix this error, so any help is appreciated.</p>
<pre><code>import time

    miles = 0.00

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your <code>while</code> loop crashes on its second evaluation of <code>miles &lt; 500.00</code>, because <code>miles</code> is a float the first time through (which is OK), but <code>None</code> the second (which is absolutely <em>not</em> OK).  This is what the error message was telling you.</p>
<p>More specifically, <code>sort</code> doesn't return anything, so <code>miles = mile()</code> assigns to <code>miles</code> the <code>None</code> returned by <code>cardistance.sort()</code>.</p>
<p>As an aside, your <code>Car</code> class isn't really a class...  At least, it does nothing anyone expects a class to do, and you never use it.  Your entire program runs only as a side-effect of class definition --- in other words, by accident.</p>
<p>You probably wanted a <em>function</em> (or several), not a class definition.  Then, later, you would call that function, ideally from <code>main</code>.  Something like:</p>
<pre><code>def race():
    # As above...

# Later...
def main():
    race()
    return

if "__main__" == __name__:
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>I suggest you re-read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow">Python Tutorial's "Defining Functions" section</a>.  Then move on to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow">Python Tutorial's "Classes" chapter</a>, and contrast what you're doing with how classes are typically created and used.</p>
