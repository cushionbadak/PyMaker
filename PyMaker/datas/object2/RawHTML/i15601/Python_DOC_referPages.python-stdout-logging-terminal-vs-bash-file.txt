<p>I am not expert in Bash and Python, so this question might appear silly.</p>
<p>I have a Python script called <code>learn.py</code> and I noticed two different behaviours of the standard output, when redirected to a log file.</p>
<p>If I call this from terminal, I can see the log file size growing while the script is running.</p>
<pre><code>$ ./learn.py &gt; file.log
</code></pre>
<p>However, if I create a bash file for the same purpose:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
./learn.py &gt; file.log
</code></pre>
<p>the script starts (I checked with <code>pgrep</code>) but it does not seem to run, as the log file stays empty. Am I missing something?</p>

<p>I solved using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/logging.html" rel="nofollow">Logging facility for Python</a>, by inserting</p>
<pre><code>import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='file.log',level=logging.INFO)
</code></pre>
<p>and replacing every occurrence of <code>print "..."</code> with</p>
<pre><code>logging.info("...")
</code></pre>
<p>The final Bash script:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
./learn.py
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you post what your <code>learn.py</code> script does?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">even if all you put in <code>learn.py</code> is <code>print "Hello?"</code> ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Balthamos <code>learn.py</code> is a complex script which uses NLTK libraries. @JoranBeasley It works putting just "hello". Is it possible that the file will be filled only at the end of the computation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's buffering, but I don't know why it would decide to buffer only in the script. How did you start it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@thatotherguy I start the bash script with <code>./launcher</code> after setting it executable with <code>chmod +x</code>.</span>
