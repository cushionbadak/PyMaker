<p>My program loops through this subprocess that returns server latency.  </p>
<pre><code>startupinfo = subprocess.STARTUPINFO()
startupinfo.dwFlags |= subprocess.STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW
latency = subprocess.Popen(["ping.exe", "141.101.115.212"], 
                           stdout=subprocess.PIPE, 
                           startupinfo=startupinfo)
latency = str(x.communicate()[0])
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that the program will pause mid-loop to allow the subprocess to finish. Is there a way to skip this subprocess until it is finished so I may continue looping?</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong></p>
<p>The reason I can't just wait for the subprocess to finish is because I need to be able to click and drag the window the latency is displayed on. If the subprocess isn't finshed, the window will not move. This creates a lag effect. </p>
<pre><code>class WindowDraggable():

<p><code>latency</code> is bound to both the <code>subprocess</code> command and the converted output.  While it is the <code>subprocess</code> command you can use:</p>
<pre><code>latency.poll()
</code></pre>
<p>to check if it has finished yet.  For more info, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.poll" rel="nofollow">check the docs</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">is the result relevant to the rest of your code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PadraicCunningham I am looping through this code so I can refresh the latency I display on a window. The problem is I cannot drag the window around while my program is waiting for the subprocess to finish. The subprocess is creating a lag effect. Do you understand me?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think so, the results of the pings are used as output later in your program?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PadraicCunningham The ping displayed on the window is refreshed as soon as the new ping is made available by the subprocess.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use a thread to communicate with the subprocess, and a queue to pass the resulting data to your main thread. And @PadraicCunningham I doubt you've understood the problem, OP is blocking his GUI thread thus his window becomes unresponsive.</span>
