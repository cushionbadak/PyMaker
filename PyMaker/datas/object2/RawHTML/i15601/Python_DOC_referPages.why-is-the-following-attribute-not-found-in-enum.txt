<p>I am using Python 2.7.5 and I installed Enum as </p>
<p><code>pip install Enum</code></p>
<p>I have written out the following code to test Enum.</p>
<pre><code>from enum import Enum
class Color(Enum):
  red = 'Hello'
  blue = 'Trello'
  green = 'Yello'

for name, attr in Color.__members__.items():
  print(attr.value)
</code></pre>
<p>This throws me an error saying.</p>
<p><code>AttributeError: type object 'Color' has no attribute '__members__'</code>.</p>
<p>Why is python not able to get <code>__members__</code> ?</p>

<p>You're confusing <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum/" rel="nofollow"><code>enum</code></a> with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html" rel="nofollow"><code>enum</code></a>. They have many similarities, but are not the same thing. In particular, the attribute you're looking for does not exist.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to use the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34" rel="noreferrer">enum34 backport</a>:</p>
<pre><code>pip install enum34
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you have to install enum34 to get key value pair</p>
<pre><code>yum install python-enum34
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Because it doesn't exist.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But then is Enum not backported</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you need to install it from PyPI then it hasn't been backported. Especially since it was created in 2009.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IgnacioVazquez-Abrams: I don't understand your comment -- many new Python features are backported and put on PyPI.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EthanFurman: "Backported" implies that they're part of the language proper, not some module that needs to be installed from somewhere else.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It worked when I installed Enum34</span>
