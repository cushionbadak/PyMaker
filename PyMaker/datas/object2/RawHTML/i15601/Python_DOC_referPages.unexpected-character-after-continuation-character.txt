<p>I am new to working with Python, and seem to be having an issue that no matter what I search, and no matter what I try, still presists.</p>
<p>I am trying to execute a system command using the <code>exec</code> function.</p>
<p>I have tried the following:</p>
<pre><code>exec("/usr/sbin/something --arg")
</code></pre>
<p>Which returns invalid syntax with a cursor on the first <code>/</code></p>
<p>I have tried</p>
<pre><code>exec("\\usr\\sbin\\something --arg")
</code></pre>
<p>Which returns unexpected character after line continuation character and a cursor on the last character of my argument <code>g</code> in this case.</p>
<p>I have been searching for a solution for the last hour, and nothing has helped. How can I simply execute this command without an error being thrown?</p>
<p>Yes, my line endings are correct.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>exec</code> is used to execute <em>Python code</em> that is represented as a string or code object.  From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>exec(object[, globals[, locals]])</code></p>
<p>This function supports dynamic execution of Python code. <code>object</code> must be either a string or a code object. If it is a string, the string is parsed as a suite of Python statements which is then executed (unless a syntax error occurs).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To execute a system command, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system" rel="nofollow"><code>os.system</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.system("/usr/sbin/something --arg")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Maybe try putting an <code>r</code> in front of the string so it reads <code>exec(r"\\usr\\sbin\\something --arg")</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">:/ Really... Wish I had known that sooner... :D Thanks! <i>Edit</i> It worked, I will accept when I can.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks again dude! Happy coding!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I actually tried using both <code>r</code> and <code>R</code>. No changes in the errors.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Placing an <code>r</code> before a string literal makes it a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">raw-string</a>, which simply means that escape sequences are not processed.  But this is unnecessary in the OP's case because he already escaped all of his backslashes.</span>
