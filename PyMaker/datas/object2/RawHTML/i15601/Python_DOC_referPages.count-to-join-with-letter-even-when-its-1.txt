<pre><code>wordFile = open('words.txt')
words = list(wordFile.read())
char = set(words)

chars.remove('\n')
for char in chars:
  count = words.count(char)
  if count &gt; 1:
     print (char,'appears', count, 'time')
</code></pre>
<p>I want the code above to output the number of times the symbol appears even when the value is '1'.
Here is the current output of the code:</p>
<pre><code>8 appears 3 times
0 appears 3 times
1 appears 3 times
2 appears 2 times
3 appears 6 times
4 appears 2 times
7 appears 2 times
) appears 2 times
* appears 4 times
+ appears 2 times
- appears 2 times
# appears 8 times
% appears 4 times
&amp; appears 7 times
</code></pre>
<p>However, it is missing the values that appear '1' time (i.e.'\')
Here is what is stored inside words.txt</p>
<pre><code>#+/084&amp;"
#3*#%#+
8%203:
,1$&amp;
!-*%
.#7&amp;33&amp;
#*#71%
&amp;-&amp;641'2
#))85
9&amp;330*
</code></pre>
<p>So just to clarify the point of this is to output the freaquency that the symbol appears in the file. Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>While <code>return true</code> answered your question;</p>
<p>You may want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> to find the frequencies.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import collections
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('words.txt') as f:
    words = list(f.read())


&gt;&gt;&gt; count = collections.Counter(words)
&gt;&gt;&gt; del count['\n']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for c, n in count.items():
    print('{} appears {} times'.format(c, n))

! appears 1 times
# appears 8 times
" appears 1 times
% appears 4 times
$ appears 1 times
....
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Change <code>if count &gt; 1:</code> to <code>if count &gt; 0:</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>with open('words.txt') as wordFile :
    words = list(wordFile.read())
    char = set(words)
    chars = list(char)
    chars.remove('\n')
    for char in chars:
      count = words.count(char)
      print (char,'appears', count, 'time')
</code></pre>
<p>There's really no need for the <code>if</code> at all if you are going to print anything greater than 0.</p>
