<p>I've made a game and I'd like to save the highscore.  So I need a place to do that. I chose to put it in the <code>C:\All Programs</code> directory. My problem is that that directory name isn't the same on every computer. For example on mine it's <code>C:/Program Files</code> (x86).</p>
<p>So my question:
Is there a way, to discover that path on any computer?</p>
<p>PROBLEM SOLVED:<br/>
os.getenv('PROGRAMFILES')</p>

<p>I second @iCodez's answer to use <code>os.getenv</code>to get the path string from a system environment variable, but you might want to use the paths defined for APPDATA or LOCALAPPDATA instead. </p>
<p>Windows permissions settings on the Program Files directory may prevent a standard user account from writing data to the directory. </p>
<p>I believe the APPDATA and LOCALAPPDATA paths were designed for just such a use. On my system, APPDATA = <code>C:\Users\myname\AppData\Roaming</code> and LOCALAPPDATA = <code>C:\Users\myname\AppData\Local</code>. My user account has full read/write permission for both directories.</p>

<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getenv" rel="nofollow"><code>os.getenv</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ" rel="nofollow"><code>os.environ</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; os.getenv('PROGRAMFILES')
'C:\\Program Files'
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.environ['PROGRAMFILES']
'C:\\Program Files'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you can also specify a default return value for when an environment variable is not set:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; os.getenv('BADVAR', 'default')
'default'
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.environ.get('BADVAR', 'default')
'default'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't look like you've done much research. I suggest looking up <code>Python Relative Paths</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't find anything - only ppl who want to find out their scripts file. But I want to get the normal programs file like C:/Program Files/</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/918154/relative-paths-in-python" title="relative paths in python">stackoverflow.com/questions/918154/relative-paths-in-python</a> First result on that exact search, seems very relevant to me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EliasBenevedes - how does a relative paths search help on a question about absolute paths?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EliasBenevedes, that link appears to be unrelated; I believe you've misunderstood the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">os.getenv('PROGRAMFILES') was the thing. Thank you :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">os.getenv('PROGRAMFILES') is exactly the thing I was looking for. Thank you</span>
