<p>I have a list of that contains times. Each time is the number of seconds from Jan 1, 1904. This is not Unix or any other conversion I have familiar with. How can I convert this to the date?</p>
<p>An example of this is 3438012868.0 which is 3438012868.0 seconds from Jan 1, 1904. I want this date to be Dec 11, 2012, 1:00.30 pm</p>

<p>Use the <code>datetime</code> and <code>timedelta</code> classes for this kind of thing.</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, timedelta

date = datetime(1904,1,1) # January 1st, 1904 at midnight

delta = timedelta(seconds = 10000000)

newdate = date + delta
</code></pre>
<p><code>newdate</code> will evaulate to <code>datetime.datetime(1904, 4, 26, 17, 46, 40)</code>, which is April 26, 1904, </p>

<span class="comment-copy">This question is not completely clear: can you post an example of one of the times from the list? Is the time represented by a string, or is it another type of object?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">The only source I know for that format of date is Excel for the Mac. See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/180162" rel="nofollow noreferrer">support.microsoft.com/kb/180162</a>, even though it's wrong about the start date for the 1900 based dates.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just edited to give an example</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your example is inconsistent with your description of the format.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The technique is perfect, the details are not - the question specified <i>1904</i>, not <i>1901</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Whoops, fixing that now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm a little confused on this. I thought timedelta gives the time between two different times, what is this timedelta giving the time between? Sorry, this might be simple. I'm still really new to python. I also edited my question to give an example of one of the times. They are in seconds, so would i put that time in timedelta(seconds = data_seconds)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just tried      for data_seconds in time:           date = datetime(1904,1,1)         delta = timedelta(seconds = data_seconds)         newdate = date + delta     print newdate and it gave me the wrong date. It gave me 18 days ahead and several hours ahead. I tried manually putting in the first time from the time list and it gave me the right date but about 16 hours ahead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just realized this is the Mac Timestamp if that means anything useful.</span>
