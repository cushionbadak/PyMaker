<p>how would i add random operators to this? also how would i do another question lIke this?</p>
<pre><code>import random
def main():
print ("This program prints 2 random number from 1,10")

num1 = random.randint(1,10)
num2 = random.randint(1,10)

total = (num1 + num2)
print (num1, "\n","+","\n",num2)

ans = int(input("enter answer"))

if total == ans:
print ("correct")

else:
print ("wrong")
def sum(num1,num2):
return num1 + num2
</code></pre>

<p>I suggest you edit your question, because it is pretty hard to understand what are you asking about and please edit your indentation. Ok now to the code.</p>
<p>As I understand, you want to choose a random math operator (+, -, /, *). You can do this:</p>
<pre><code>import operator
import random

# A list of possible operators (functions)
OP_LIST = [
    operator.add,
    operator.sub,
    operator.div,
    operator.mul
]

# Choose a random one!
op = random.choice(OP_LIST)

# And use it
print op(10, 20)
</code></pre>
<p>I suggest you take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/operator.html" rel="nofollow">operator</a> module, it provides a lot of useful functions for stuff like this.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What exactly is your question? This is neither a code-writing nor a tutorial service. Based on the indentation, I'd say you should read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to make sure you copy and paste the code properly. Python cares about spaces and you're missing an <code>=</code> in <code>num2 = random.randint(1,10)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, I wouldn't redefine <code>sum</code>, it already exists and you may as well just write <code>num1 + num2</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thx guys i had to write the code and not paste itlol i fixed it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">right thats what i wanted to  do</span>
