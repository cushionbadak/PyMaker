<p>Note: Timeouts (relative delay or absolute when) should not exceed one day.</p>

<p>Does anyone have a good explanation as to why this limit exists?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>This is due to <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue20493" rel="noreferrer">issue 20493</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In asyncio, if the next event is in 2^40 seconds, epoll.poll() raises an OverflowError because epoll_wait() maximum value for the timeout is INT_MAX seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Guido van Rossum suggested that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For now, can we just add to the asyncio docs that timeouts shouldn't exceed one day? Then we can fix it later without breaking expectations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's best to read the full issue log for all details and considerations.</p>
