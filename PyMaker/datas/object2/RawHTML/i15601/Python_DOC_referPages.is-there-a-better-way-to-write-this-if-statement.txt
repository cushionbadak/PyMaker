<p>What is the better way of doing this: </p>
<pre><code>if pattern[0] != [0] or pattern[0] != [0 , 0] or ... so on:

<p>It seems like you are looking for  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow"><code>any</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>if any(pattern[0]):
</code></pre>
<p>This solution tests if any of the items in <code>pattern[0]</code> are not equal to <code>0</code>.  It works because <code>0</code> evaluates to <code>False</code> in Python.  Of course, it also assumes that <code>pattern[0]</code> is iterable since you were comparing it to lists originally.</p>
<p>Also, the condition of your if-statement is incorrect regardless of what you are trying to do.  It will always be <code>True</code> because <code>pattern[0]</code> will always be either not equal to <code>[0]</code> or not equal to <code>[0, 0]</code>.  You should be using <code>and</code> instead of <code>or</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if pattern[0] != [0] and pattern[0] != [0 , 0] and ... so on:
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Is there a limit, or do you want to detect up to an infinity of zeros? In any case, since <code>pattern[0]</code> can't be both <code>[0]</code> and <code>[0,0]</code> at the same time, you can change the whole thing to <code>if True:</code> :-) Or did you mean <code>and</code> rather than <code>or</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well let's say the limit is 20 of zeros [ 0, 0, -&gt;18 more ]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is the <code>else</code> case?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no else case here</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@paxdiablo if <code>pattern</code> is <code>[[0, 0]]</code> could it not fit <code>pattern[0] != [0 , 0]</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Until OP clarifies the question re use of <code>and</code> or <code>or</code>, this is technically wrong. It's <i>probably</i> right but you may want to note the discepency in your answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@paxdiablo well I need it for OR(as i asked above), but will be nice to have with AND for future reference.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ iCodez, I see it now, thank you.</span>
