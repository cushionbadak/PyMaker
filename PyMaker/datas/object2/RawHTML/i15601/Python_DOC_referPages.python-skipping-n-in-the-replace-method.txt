<p>there are two possible things any of which will do either 
  <strong>Possible solution 1) :</strong> 
  if the replace method works inside loop
  I am trying to do a replace at two
  places, the replace function with the raw string notation works for
  the above variable <code>json_input_string</code> but the same replace fails when
  I try to do so inside the <em>loop of <code>list1</code></em>.</p>
<p>(list1 has data in the unicode format like this [u' set variable Text '
  ' ',u'expression Text ' ' in table'] Moreover most of the python read
  write functions I have tried so far fail when I need <code>'\n'</code> to be kept
  in the replacement string.) 
  OR 
  <strong>Possible Solution 2)</strong> 
  If the json_input_string can give me data in desired format
   when i print json_input_string it gives me the output as below even though its type is 'str':</p>

<pre><code>json_input_string=[u'SET X=ABC', u'USE @{Domain}', u"Create table DEF"]

<p>some have single quotes and some have double quotes. I want to convert
  this string into an output without single/double quotes like this and
  write to a file.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>m = str(c).replace(...)</code> the new string is in <code>m</code>, not <code>c</code>. Python strings are immutable.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot guys for the help .luckily i got the answer . I was
  thinking ,because i don't see '\n' as text it is not there but it
  just shifts to a new line so if i just change my replace method from</p>

<pre><code>replace("LINES TERMINATED BY ' '","LINES TERMINATED BY '\\n'");

<p>also you need to hold this replace inside a loop by assigning the replace value to a variable</p>
<p>it works fine :).thanks for your efforts</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you aware that the last line of your script prints <code>c</code> again and not <code>m</code> which hold the result of your <code>replace</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry .i have updated the code ..that was typo..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Difficult to interpret this one. The only sample you show of what <code>list1</code> might be uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literal-concatenation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string literal concatenation</a>, most likely unintentionally, and <code>'\n'</code> is an escape sequence for newline which you've disabled using raw literals. Please give us clear values (try using <code>repr</code>) of input data, manipulating code, produced result, and what you expected.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi yann i have updated the question to include all details</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Still not seeing it. The word <code>Text</code> appears nowhere in your data, so neither replace operation can have any effect. Also confused about why your text is in weirdly formatted quote blocks and code has a semicolon infection.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry that was a typo .i have updated it in the code</span>
