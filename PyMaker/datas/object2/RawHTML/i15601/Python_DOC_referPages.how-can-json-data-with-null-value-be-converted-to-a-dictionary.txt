<p>I have JSON data which looks like this. If not for null (without quotes as a string), I could have used <code>ast</code> module's <code>literal_eval</code> to convert the above to a dictionary. </p>
<p>A dictionary in Python cannot have <code>null</code> as value but can have <code>"null"</code> as a value. How do I convert the above to a dictionary that Python recognizes?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should use the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>json</code> module</a>, which was designed explicitly for this task:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import json
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = '''
... {
...   "abc": null,
...   "def": 9
... }
... '''
&gt;&gt;&gt; json.loads(data)
{'def': 9, 'abc': None}
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(json.loads(data))
&lt;class 'dict'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>By the way, you should use this method even if your JSON data contains no <code>null</code> values.  While it may work (sometimes), <code>ast.literal_eval</code> was designed to evaluate <em>Python</em> code that is represented as a string.  It is simply the wrong tool to work with JSON data.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">hd1 - for some reason. iCodez comment showed up first. Sorry! so i had to mark it as the answer but thanks Good show!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2921139: If you really want to translate <code>null</code> to <code>"null"</code> rather than <code>None</code> as your question implies, you will need to do a bit of extra work. But I suspect that you don't want that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No abarnert. I am good but curious - how would u do the null to "null"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there any way to do null to  "null" ?</span>
