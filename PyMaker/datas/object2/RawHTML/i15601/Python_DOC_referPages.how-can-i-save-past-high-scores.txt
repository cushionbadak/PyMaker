<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I currently have this code for a high scores list:</p>
<pre><code>scores = []
choice = None
while choice != "0":
    print(
    """
    High Scores
    0 - Quit
    1 - List Scores
    2 - Add a Score
    """
    )
    choice = input("Choice: ")
    print()
    if choice == "0":
        print("Goodbye")
    elif choice == "1":
        print("High Scores\n")
        print("NAME\tSCORE")
        for entry in scores:
            score, name = entry
            print(name, "\t", score)
    elif choice == "2":
        name = input("What is your name? ")
        score = int(input("What score did you get? "))
        entry = [score, name]
        scores.append(entry)
        scores.sort(reverse=True)
        scores = scores[:10]
    else:
        print("Sorry, but", choice, "isn't a valid choice.")
</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone tell me how to add code in which will save the high score for next time the program is used</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your best bet is the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow"><code>json</code> module</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import json

def load_scores():
    with open("scores.json") as infile:
        return json.load(infile)

def save_scores(scores):
    with open("scores.json", "w") as outfile:
        json.dump(scores, outfile)
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can call <code>save_scores(scores)</code> to save the current highscore list, and do <code>scores = load_scores()</code> to get them back from the file.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">For that you will have to save it to some file/database</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pickle</a> module, very simple to use.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does that just get put in anywhere or does it need to be in a specific place?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, the block of code above should go at the top level of your program. If you create a file called <code>scores.json</code> that contains nothing but <code>[]</code> and place it in the same directory as your script, then you can replace the line <code>scores = []</code> with <code>scores = load_scores()</code>. The call to <code>save_scores</code> would make most sense as the last line of your script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">All sorted. Thanks for the help</span>
