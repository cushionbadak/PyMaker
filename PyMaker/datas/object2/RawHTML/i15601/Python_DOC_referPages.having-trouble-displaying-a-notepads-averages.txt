<p>I need to make a program that displays an average of about 5 numbers from a notepad file. I feel that I have most of the code right but I keep getting this error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer." </p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can I fix it? Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    numbers = open('numbers.txt', 'r')

    list_numbers = numbers.readline()

    amount = float(list_numbers)

    for value in range(amount): # &lt;----- ERROR HAPPENS ON THIS LINE
        amount += value

    average = total / len(numbers)
    print('The average of numbers is', average)

main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>range</code> built-in only accepts integer arguments:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; range(10.0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
&gt;&gt;&gt; range(10)
range(0, 10)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Thus, <code>amount</code> needs to be an integer:</p>
<pre><code>amount = int(list_numbers)
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you forgot to close the file at the end of your function. You can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement" rel="nofollow">with-statement</a> so that this is done automatically:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    with open('numbers.txt', 'r') as numbers:
        list_numbers = numbers.readline()

        amount = int(list_numbers)

        for value in range(amount):
            amount += value

        average = total / len(numbers)
        print('The average of numbers is', average)

main()
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, this line is a problem:</p>
<pre><code>average = total / len(numbers)
</code></pre>
<p><code>numbers</code> is the file object, not a list of numbers.  You need to read the numbers from the file into a list in order to do <code>len(numbers)</code>.  </p>
<p>I think you actually want something like this:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    with open('numbers.txt') as numbers:
        list_numbers = [int(x) for x in numbers if x.strip()]
    average = sum(list_numbers) / len(list_numbers)
    print('The average of numbers is', average)  
main()
</code></pre>
<p>Using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a>, it will read-in all of the numbers from the file, convert them into integers, and then store them in a list.  Afterwards, we can easily find the average by diving the sum of the list by its length.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">When i try to use your suggested code I get ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '\n'.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm, you must have a blank line in the file somewhere.  See my edit.  I added the <code>if x.strip()</code> filter to the list comprehension to skip blank lines.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You were right! Thanks for the help man, I really appreciate it.</span>
