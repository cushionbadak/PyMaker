<p>In Python, what is a method_descriptor (in plain English)?  </p>

<p><strong>You should be.</strong> If you're uninterested in debugging errors, you're in the wrong field. For the sake of polite argumentation, let's charitably assume you authored <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27068154/in-python-what-is-a-method-descriptor#comment42847586_27068154">that comment</a> under the duress of an unreasonable deadline. (<em>It happens.</em>)</p>
<p>The standard <code>pickle</code> module is incapable of serializing so-called "exotic types," including but presumably <em>not</em> limited to: functions with <code>yields</code>, nested functions, lambdas, cells, methods, unbound methods, modules, ranges, slices, <code>code</code> objects, <code>methodwrapper</code> objects, <code>dictproxy</code> objects, <code>getsetdescriptor</code> objects, <code>memberdescriptor</code> objects, <code>wrapperdescriptor</code> objects, <code>notimplemented</code> objects, <code>ellipsis</code> objects, <code>quit</code> objects, and (<em>...wait for it!</em>) <code>method_descriptor</code> objects.</p>
<p>All is not lost, however. The third-party <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dill" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dill</code> package</a> <em>is</em> capable of serializing all of these types and substantially more. Since <code>dill</code> is a drop-in replacement for <code>pickle</code>, globally replacing all calls across your codebase to the <code>pickle.dump()</code> function with the equivalent <code>dill.dump()</code> function <em>should</em> suffice to pickle the problematic method descriptors in question.</p>

<p><strong>No, you don't.</strong> There <em>is</em> no plain-English explanation of method descriptors, because the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">descriptor protocol</a> underlying method descriptors is deliciously dark voodoo.</p>
<p>It's voodoo, because it has to be; it's the fundamental basis for Python's core implementation of functions, properties, static methods, and class methods. It's dark, because only a dwindling cabal of secretive Pythonistas are actually capable of correctly implementing a descriptor in the wild. It's delicious, because the power that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html#descriptor-protocol" rel="nofollow noreferrer">data descriptors</a> in particular provide is nonpareil in the Python ecosystem.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you don't <em>need</em> to know what method descriptors are to pickle them. You only need to switch to <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dill" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dill</code></a>.</p>

<p>method_descriptor is a normal class with

<span class="comment-copy">Could you post the code that led to this error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suspect you forgot your function call parentheses somewhere, so your code is trying to pickle a method instead of its return value.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I am not interested in debugging this error, and I found all the answers to these other questions unclear.   I just want to know what a method_descriptor is, in plain English.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the last code snippet in the link explains it (but I'm just pattern matching).  The naming seems pretty bad, but I guess method_descriptor is just the type of a method that is attached to a class (only (as opposed to an instance of the class)).</span>
