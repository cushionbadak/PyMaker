In particular, post your own code with your question, and avoid linking to code on external sites.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This should be one of the things that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>2to3</code></a> can fix automatically. (Although you should always look over the output rather than trusting it to be magic, of course.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, I see that the very next line in the docs you linked already says that, so I probably didn't need that comment. :)</span>
