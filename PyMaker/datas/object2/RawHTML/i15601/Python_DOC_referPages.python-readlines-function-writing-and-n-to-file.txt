<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I have this code here which I am sure is trivial to my question as it is just question about readlines in general:</p>
<pre><code>        lines = file_in.readlines()
        self.inputText.insert(1.0, lines,)
</code></pre>
<p>If I were to read in a text file, it would write like this to a text file</p>
<blockquote>
<p>['Example Text'\n']</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or something to that nature instead of what we really want which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example Text</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do I avoid this problem?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.readlines" rel="nofollow"><code>readlines()</code></a> gives you a list of lines. When you try to turn a list as a string, it gives you brackets and commas and the <code>repr</code> (the for-a-programmer-representation, rather than the <code>str</code>, the for-an-end-user-representation, which is why you get the quotes and the <code>\n</code> instead of a newline) of each of its elements. That's not what you want.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> fix it up after the fact, or add each of the lines one by one, but there's a much simpler way: just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedIOBase.read" rel="nofollow"><code>read()</code></a>, which gives you the whole file as one big string:</p>
<pre><code>contents = file_in.read()
self.inputText.insert(1.0, contents,)
</code></pre>
<p>On top of being less code, and harder to get wrong, this means you're not making Python waste time splitting the contents up into a bunch of separate lines just so you can put them back together.</p>
<hr/>
<p>As a side note, <a href="http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.com/2013/06/readlines-considered-silly.html" rel="nofollow">there's almost <em>never</em> a good reason to call <code>readlines()</code></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>readlines</code> returns a list of lines. To insert this into a text widget you can join those items with a newline, like so:</p>
<pre><code>lines = file_in.readlines()
self.inputText.insert("1.0", "\n".join(lines))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you just want <code>"".join(lines)</code>, because <code>readlines()</code> doesn't strip the lines.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could also just use <code>read()</code> here.</span>
