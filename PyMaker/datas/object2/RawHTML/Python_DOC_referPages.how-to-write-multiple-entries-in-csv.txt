<p>I need to write each one of them as a row in a csv file without the '[,'']' towards the end.</p>
<p>Hence in my csv the sample output be:</p>
<pre><code>connect - appears cant lose make pretty pro make compared made tracked navigate click kept trail downloaded
gps - hope happy appears entire reading good start eg negative crashed happens save expect certain drain
gps - hope happy appears entire reading good start eg negative crashed happens save expect certain drain
matter - go run set big high kill
accuracy - average show give found nice free overall remove need huge lose record endomondo web switched
</code></pre>
<p>A row for each entry</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming you have a list of lists</p>
<pre><code>clean = [['element', ''], ['element 2', '']]
file = open('filename.csv', 'w')
for element in clean:
    file.write(element[0]+'\n')
file.close()
