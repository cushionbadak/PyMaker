<p>CONTEXT:
I am having trouble installing a module (namely 'plotly').  I have seen a lot of information, which is overwhelming, and so I hope to take the problem step-by-step.</p>
<p>SETUP:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacOS High Sierra version 10.13.3</li>
<li>python version 2.7.10</li>
<li>possibly relevant: I also installed python 3.6, but when I type <code>python</code> version 2.7 gets started (this is another issue that I need to sort out)</li>
</ul>
<p>WHAT I HAVE TRIED (OR REFRAINED FROM DOING) AND WHAT I UNDERSTAND:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simply typing <code>pip install plotly</code> throws an error (and I think I understand why it should): <code>OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/ipython_genutils'</code></li>
<li>In the past I have used <code>sudo pip install</code>, but since then have learned it is a bad thing, so now I am trying to do things "neatly".</li>
<li>Disappointingly, doing <code>pip install --user plotly</code> also throws an permission error, but not the same as 1.:
<code>OSError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Users/erc/Library/Python/2.7'</code>
which I guess is logical since it is trying to install the module in a different location.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point I am not sure what to do.  </p>

<p>Using Pip is not the best idea, try using virtualenv:</p>
<pre><code>pip install virtualenv
</code></pre>
<p>The installation of virtualenv shouldn’t throw an error.
Look up the usage, or use this reference:

<p>Also, try python3 to execute 3.6.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">have you tried <code>pip3 install plotly</code> too? this will try to install with python3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You’ll want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">venvs</a> for everything – use <code>python3</code> to refer to Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I must have seen this before, I can't believe I did not try it... Thanks to Ryan and Marti 157 for the tip!  It will be helpful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@nj2237 I didn't know about pip3... but then it means I cannot use with python 2 the module installed with python3, and this is not fully solving my problem.  I am really trying to <i>understand</i> what is going on, before going ahead and "just trying" pip3.  There is probably little chance of messing things up further.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ryan ... and I didn't know about <code>venv</code> either!  Thanks for the tip. I might decide to go with python3 from now on, but again this is not telling me why I am getting the error with the install under <code>--user</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I had also tried this, and guess what, it gave me <code>'/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/virtualenv.pyc'</code> ...</span>
