<p>The full question, and I'm starting to learn python online but having issue with this question marked as easy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each
  element appear only once and return the new length. Do not allocate
  extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input
  array in-place with O(1) extra memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        k=0
        for i in range(i+1,len(nums)-1):
            j=i+1

            for j in range(j+1,len(len(nums))):
                if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                    del nums[j]
        len_list = nums
        return(len_list, nums)

<p>It is fairly easy, once you realize you have to work from the <em>end</em> of the list, so that your deletions do not change the part of the list you have not yet examined.</p>
<pre><code>a = [1,1,1,3,4,5,5,5,5,7,7,7,9,9]
for i in range(len(a)-1,0,-1):
    if a[i] == a[i-1]:
        del a[i]
</code></pre>
<p>Result is</p>
<pre><code>[1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9]
</code></pre>
