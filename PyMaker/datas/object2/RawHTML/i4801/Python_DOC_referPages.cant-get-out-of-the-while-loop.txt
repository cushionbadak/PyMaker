<p>I need to make this program get the users input from individually asking for each word, then putting it into a list and displaying the list as a sentence and then it displays how many words are in the sentence. I just can't seem to figure out how to get out of this While loop. When I put in anything besides "y" or "Y" in the input box it always repeats the input for a word.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<pre><code>list1=[]
again = True
count = 0

choose = str(input('Enter another word? (y or Y for yes, n or N no): '))
while choose == 'y' or 'Y':
    again = True
    if again == True:
        words = input('Enter a word: ')
        choose = str(input('Enter another word? (y or Y for yes): '))

else:
    again = False

if list1 !=' ':
    readList = list1
    count += 1
    print(readList.capitalize(), '.', '\n')

print('Your sentence has', count, 'words in it.')
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong><em>'Y'</em></strong> will always return <strong><em>true</em></strong></p>
<p>Change to this:</p>
<pre><code>while choose == 'y' or choose == 'Y':
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>while choose.lower() == 'y'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">There are a lot of problems here. The first one is that <code>choose == 'y' or 'Y'</code> means <code>(choose == 'y') or 'Y'</code>, which is either going to be <code>True</code> or the letter <code>'Y'</code>, which are both truthy. But beyond that, you're testing <code>again</code> when you've just set it to <code>True</code> so the test can't be useful, and all you do with the test anyway is assign <code>again</code> the value it already has, so…</span>
<span class="comment-copy">with current formatting your code shouldn't compile. The <code>else</code> has bad indentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You'll want to set the loop to <code>while choose == 'y' or choose == 'Y'</code> and then indent the rest of you code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@triandicAnt: No, it's perfectly legal—although it probably doesn't mean what he intended. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>while</code> statements have <code>else</code> clauses</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you Ruslan, I appreciate the help.</span>
