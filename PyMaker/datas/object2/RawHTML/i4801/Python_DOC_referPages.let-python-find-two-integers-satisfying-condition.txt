<p><strong>Set-up</strong></p>
<p>I'm looking for all the integer pairs <code>(x,y)</code> in 2 closed sets: <code>[822,2000]</code> and <code>[506,1231]</code> such that <code>x/y=1.624</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Code so far</strong></p>
<p>I tried,</p>
<pre><code>a = [[(x,y)] for x in range(822,2001) and y in range(506,1232) if x/y = 1.624]
</code></pre>
<p>But this gives a <code>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code> pointing to the <code>=</code> in the code. </p>
<p>And if I do,</p>
<pre><code>a = [[(x,y)] for x in range(822,2001) and y in range(506,1232) if x/y &lt;= 1.624]
</code></pre>
<p>I get <code>NameError: name 'y' is not defined</code>. </p>
<p>How do I solve this?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Comparing float calculations with == is difficult due to the nature of float arithmetics. </p>
<p>It is often better to compare like this:</p>
<pre><code>a = [(x,y) for x in range(822,2001) for y in range(506,1232) if abs(x/y - 1.624) &lt; 0.00001] 
print(set(a)) 
</code></pre>
<p>By substracting the wanted value from your result and and comparing its absolute value against something kindof small you get better results.</p>
<p>Result (using a set):</p>
<pre><code>{(1624, 1000), (1637, 1008), (1015, 625), (1611, 992), (1840, 1133), 
 (1814, 1117), (1827, 1125), (1408, 867), (1218, 750), (1434, 883), 
 (1421, 875)}
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For the first one you are using the assignment operator instead of the equivalent operator so it should be: </p>
<p><code>a = [[(x,y)] for x in range(822,2001) and y in range(506,1232) if x/y == 1.624]</code></p>
<p>And for the second you're probably better off using two for loops</p>
<p><code>a = [[(x,y)] for x in range(822,2001) for y in range(506,1232) if x/y &lt;= 1.624]</code></p>
<p>The second one would not make sense as you said it because x and y are coming from lists that have an unequal number of elements so you cannot loop over them like that</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>=</code> is assignment operator, for comparison use <code>==</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">what @bro-grammer says for the first line, and for the second - you mean <code>for y in</code> not <code>and y in</code>... and you probably want <code>[(x, y)</code>... instead of <code>[[(x, y]</code>... unless you really want a list of one element lists instead of a list of tuples...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bro-grammer (cc JonClements) Hm... it looks like that the higher-rep users get an unfair (?) advantages of being able to give hints in comment?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for helping this dummy out. Solved it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user202729 nobody hinders users with 1 rep to try to answer things - it is possible to gain 50 rep and then be able to comment - not easy, just possible :) and commments do not get you any rep as is, so experienced users giving hints might help less experienced ones to get to an answer and to rep.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html#pep-485-a-function-for-testing-approximate-equality" rel="nofollow noreferrer">math.isclose</a>, but only available for <code>python&gt;=3.5</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bro-grammer  nice, did not know that one, thanks</span>
