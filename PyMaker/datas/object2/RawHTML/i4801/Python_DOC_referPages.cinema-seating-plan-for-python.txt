<p>I am creating a seating plan for a movie theater and I am having a problem with adding a seat request after already purchasing one seat. </p>

<p>After choosing option 4 and purchasing a seat and keep answering to input the row you want and the seat when you input another different row and seat coordinates it says "This seat has already been taken"</p>
<p>I have been looking everywhere for an answer and I cant seem to find something. Please help if you can, thanks. </p>

<p>The <code>any</code> method returns:
<code>True</code> if at least one element of an iterable is true.
<code>False</code> if all elements are false or if an iterable is empty.
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Refer Python Documentation for any method usage</a></p>
<p>Line 42 <code>if any((str(rowx) + "," + str(rowy)) for x in taken_seats):</code>, should actually be <code>if (str(rowx) + "," + str(rowy) in taken_seats):</code> .
That should check whether the selected seat is present in the list <code>taken_sets</code>.</p>
