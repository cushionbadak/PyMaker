<p><strong>Objective:</strong> to find digits that start at the beginning of a sentence and change the number in place to equal the original number plus 10%.</p>
<pre><code>msg_orginal = """Hello, I am new here. 
2,431 other coders are new here too. 
Imagine if 2.5 were not new here? 
2,428.5 would then be new."""

<p>The output I am seeking is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>msg_revised = """Hello, I am new here. 
2,674.1 other coders are new here too. 
Imagine if 2.5 were not new here? 
2,671.35 would then be new."""
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how two of the three sentences have changed the numerical values, but one did not. </p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Keep in mind the same number could appear multiple times in the string. And a new sentence is a sentence that comes either after a full stop (such as a period, exclamation mark, question mark) or that comes after a new line character. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.sub</code></a> with a regex like <code>r"^[\d,.]+"</code> using the multiline-flag <code>re.M</code> so that <code>^</code> matches a line break and a replacement function for doing the math and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1823058/1639625">formatting</a> the output:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; increase = lambda m: "{:,.2f}".format(float(m.group().replace(",","")) * 1.1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; print(re.sub(r"^[\d,.]+", increase, msg_orginal, flags=re.M))
Hello, I am new here. 
2,674.10 other coders are new here too. 
Imagine if 2.5 were not new here? 
2,671.35 would then be new.
</code></pre>
<p>This assumes that all sentences start at a new line (and no sentences span more than one line) as is the case in your example. This problems (if itis a problem) can be handled <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/4576077/1639625">separately</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@jdehesa Actually, using regex may be easier</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Student Is it possible that the same number will appear twice?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace Yes. I have added clarification to the above. Thank you for asking the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A new sentence is a sentence that comes after a full stop (or a question mark etc..) or that comes after a new line character?</span>
