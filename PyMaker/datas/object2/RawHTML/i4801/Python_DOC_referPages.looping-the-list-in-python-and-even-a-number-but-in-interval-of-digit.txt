<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">

<p>i have to loop the list and a number 
like </p>
<pre><code>myList = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i" , "j", "k", "l", "m"]
</code></pre>
<p>and output of my print should come like below:</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use a loop, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> to get the index, and use integer division to calculate the 2nd number.</p>
<pre><code>for i, s in enumerate(myList):
    print(i, s, i // 2 + 1)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">No offense but you should have tried it more, and made an attempt to search, you might have learned a lot more this way, next time give it a proper attempt.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i tried but for last holding number i couldn't understand , so asked   for i in range(0, len(myList), 1):     print i, selectionObj[i]   But atleast you should have helped</span>
