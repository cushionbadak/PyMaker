<p>Python has some built-in modules e.g _random, _ast, _collections, _md5, _functools and more.</p>
<p>In all of python implementations standard libraries are built using this built-in modules.
But I can't find any documentation for this modules. Is there any documentation?</p>
<p>full list of this modules:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.builtin_module_names
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I like using <a href="https://devdocs.io/python~3.6/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>devdocs</code></a> for quick searching through the python docs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The underscore-prefixed modules are for the implementation of the non-underscore modules. You shouldn’t need them and they aren’t documented as part of the standard library.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeliriousLettuce. I'm not searching for stdlib docs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MinaaN: Correct, <code>_random</code> is not <code>random</code>. I never said it was, though. <code>_random</code> is used to implement <code>random</code>. It’s not documented outside its source because nobody else is supposed to use it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MinaaN A part of the standard python naming convention is that <b>any</b> name preceded with underscore is a private implementation detail which it is not <i>guaranteed</i> will remain consistent or even present so should generally not be used.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not talking about python stdlib. Your references are stdlib docs. "built-in modules" are not "stdlib".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MinaaN. Right. I have edited my answer to reflect that. Thanks for the correction.</span>
