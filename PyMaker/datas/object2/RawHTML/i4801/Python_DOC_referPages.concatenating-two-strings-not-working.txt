<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have the following code:</p>
<pre><code>name=input("What do you want to call your file?")
print(name)
name=name+".txt"
print(name)
</code></pre>
<p>When I run it, I get:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;whatever was input&gt;
.txt
</code></pre>
<p>I want to get:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;whatever was input&gt;
&lt;whatever was input&gt;.txt
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried doing:</p>
<pre><code>input("What do you want to call your file?")+".txt"
</code></pre>
<p>And:</p>
<pre><code>input("What do you want to call your file?")
+=".txt"
</code></pre>
<p>but no luck.</p>
<p>What is curious is that when I run it in the shell, it works l, and also that it works in python 3.1 but not 3.4.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Remove the newline on end:  </p>
<pre><code>name = input("Q?").rstrip('\n') + "txt"
</code></pre>
<p>Or do it like so:</p>
<pre><code># thanks to Delirious Lettuce: f'{input("Filename?").rstrip('\n')}.txt'.replace("\n","") 
name = f'{input("Filename?")}.txt'.replace("\n","")
print(name)
</code></pre>
<p>What stumps though is, that the input() normally removes the return that closes its input. </p>
<p>I wonder why you get one ... for me <code>name = f'{input("Filename?")}.txt'</code> works and <code>name</code> comes out as <code>'tata.txt'</code> if I input 'tata' and hit return.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Cannot reproduceâ€¦</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it works as expected</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If your using shell, it worked for me there to. In command prompt(when I just double clicked the program) I got the problem. Have added that to my question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tried it on another computer, and no problem. Wondering what is going on. The one it worked on is Windows 7 Proffesional, 32-bit, will post later on the one it raised an error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeliriousLettuce thanks for the catch - seems I used rstrip() without the\n when testing it in pyfiddle.io</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As added to my question, it works in shell. Is it possible that it doesn't remove the \n in command prompt?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">using code <code>filename=exec("input('Filename?')+'.txt'")</code> , I get error: <code>file=open(filename, "w")</code> <code>TypeError: invalid file: None</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>rstrip</code> or <code>replace</code> not working, same problem as in the question. still working in shell.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArtemisFowl you are misusing exec. Python functions always return <code>None</code> if they do not return something implicitly. Exec does not return anything. So it returns None. Read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">exec</a> - the first paragraf, carefully.</span>
