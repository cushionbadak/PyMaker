<p>Hey guys I dont usually use regex so I need a bit of help to get some matches from the below string. I only want the information in bold to match the regex expression, any help or explanation would be appreciated thanks.</p>
<p>'"FM 2222 RD / RIVER PLACE BLVD","0:",,"18:","00","<strong>2008-08-14</strong>","<strong>CRASH/LEAVING THE SCENE</strong>","30.39452568","(30.39452568-97.84551164)","-97.84551164","18:00:00","4","2008-08-14 18:00:00-06:00","20085043619"'</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If what you need is to detect the date and the field next to it, you could use the following regex:</p>
<pre><code>expression = '"\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}","[^"]*"'
</code></pre>
<p>Working example:</p>
<pre><code>import re
my_str = '"FM 2222 RD / RIVER PLACE BLVD","0:",,"18:","00","2008-08-14","CRASH/LEAVING THE SCENE","30.39452568","(30.39452568-97.84551164)","-97.84551164","18:00:00","4","2008-08-14 18:00:00-06:00","20085043619"'
expression = '"\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}","[^"]*"'
re.findall(expression, my_str)  # returns ['"2008-08-14","CRASH/LEAVING THE SCENE"']
</code></pre>

<p>The string you provided looks like a line from a csv file and another option is to use Pythons <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv module</a>.</p>
<p>Since I don't know if you have a file or list full of these strings, this example shows how you could take this single string and read it into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv.reader</code></a> using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html?highlight=io%20stringio#io.StringIO" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>io.StringIO</code></a> (Python 3.6.4)</p>

<p>If you had the actual csv file with the header, you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv.DictReader</code></a> and then do something like <code>print(line['date'])</code> (assuming the key was 'date').</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This looks like a line from a csv file, do you have to use regex?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You'll have to be more specific about your criteria, because the regex <code>"2008-08-14","CRASH/LEAVING THE SCENE"</code> fits your description</span>
