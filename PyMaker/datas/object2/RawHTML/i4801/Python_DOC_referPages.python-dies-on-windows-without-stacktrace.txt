<p>I'm loading a large csv file into pandas and when I load too many lines at once I get a dialog box telling me "Python has stopped working" without any error messages in the terminal (<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sN1Zc.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">screenshot</a>). I suspect it's a memory limitation but it'd be nice to confirm with the python stacktrace directly.  Anyone have a similar experience and know how to get at what's happening? </p>
<p><strong>update:</strong> Turns out not to have been a memory limitation after all.  I think the root cause was a pandas issue, upgrading from 20.3 -&gt; 22.0 seems to have fixed it.  I suspect it was related to this: <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16798" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16798</a></p>

<p>Use the trace module to try and force it.</p>
<pre><code>python -u -m trace -t program.py
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>python -m pdb program.py
</code></pre>
<p>Python debugger might also provide insight. If neither of these work, it's most likely a memory issue based on the context you provided. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
