<p>I would like to extract a certain numbers in a string, after numerous tries with regex, I can't seem to find the correct pattern for it. There are other numbers but I require only the 3 digits after "M". Thank you.</p>
<p>Example:
line: <code>"2018-01-23 - member data. member_id=[M001]."</code></p>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code>001
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.findall</code></a> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>matches = re.findall( r'\[M(\d{3})\]', '2018-01-23 - member data. member_id=[M001].')
print(matches[0])

out:
001
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<pre><code>\d will find any number.
{3} will find occurrence of the match.
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.findall</code></a> with a capturing group as follows:</p>
<pre><code>matches = re.findall( r'.*\[M(.*?)\]', '2018-01-23 - member data. member_id=[M001].')
print(matches[0]) # 001
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You say you already tried this:</p>
<pre><code>m = re.search(r'member_id=[M(\d+)]', line)
</code></pre>
<p>but you need to escape the <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> characters, as they have a special meaning here.  Try this:</p>
<pre><code>m = re.search(r'member_id=\[M(\d+)\]', line)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Please show us just one of your "numerous tries"!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why does not your output includes 2018 or 01 or 23, those are numbers as well. Somewhat ambiguous case to deal with</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Constance thanks to people like you Stackoverflow becomes an unwelcoming place. You can pass the same message in a more polite and welcoming way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArpitSolanki I only need the number after "M"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Constance I have tried m = re.search(r'member_id=[M(\d+)]', line)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can put the explanation about that 3 in your answer. It will be useful for OP to use this code in other cases</span>
<span class="comment-copy">May I know why is there a need to put [0] in print command?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rayhwx: re.findall will return list containing all matches. Your first match will be at zero index. visit re.findall docs that I attached.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rahul Thank you! May I know when there is more than 1 "M" in a file, how do I include "member_id=" into regex pattern in order to find those 3 digits accurately?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">even If I answer your this question, you may get another. Please read this. It wont take much. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/re.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">May I know why is there a need to put [0] in print command?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because re.findall will return list. if your need item you will have to get by it's index.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It works! May I know how do I get all the values in the file? I have tried below method and it will become list in list. I have tried re.search, however it does not only stores the 3 digit in the list to print out.  for line in file:     try:         m = re.findall(r'member_id=[M(\d+)]', line)         memberList.append(m)      except:         m = None   print (*memberList,sep="\n")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">memberList.append(m.group(1))</span>
