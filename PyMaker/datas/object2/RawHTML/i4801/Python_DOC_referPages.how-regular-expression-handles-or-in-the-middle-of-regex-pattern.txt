<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to play with regular expressions in python. I have framed regular expression as given below. I know that <code>^</code> is used to match at the beginning of search string. I have framed by match pattern which contains multiple <code>^</code>, but I am not sure about how <code>re</code> will try to match the pattern in search string. </p>
<pre><code>re.match("^def/^def", "def/def")
</code></pre>
<p>I was expecting that <code>re</code> will be raising error, regarding invalid regular expression, but it doesn't raise any error and returns no matches.</p>
<p>So, my questions is <code>"^def/^def"</code> or <code>"$def/$def"</code> a valid regular expression ?</p>
</div>

<p>You do not have an invalid regular expression, <code>^</code> has legal uses in the middle of a string. When you use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.M" rel="noreferrer"><code>re.M</code> flag</a> for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When specified, the pattern character <code>'^'</code> matches at the beginning of the string and at the beginning of each line (immediately following each newline); and the pattern character <code>'$'</code> matches at the end of the string and at the end of each line (immediately preceding each newline).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also possible to create patterns with optional groups, where a later <code>^</code> would still match if all of the preceding pattern matched the empty string. Using the <code>^</code> in places it can't match is not something the parser checks for and no error will be raised.</p>
<p>Your specific pattern will never match anything, because the <code>^</code> in the middle is unconditional and there is no possibility that the <code>/</code> preceding it will ever match the requisite newline character, even if the multiline flag was enabled.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't your experiment demonstrate that the answer is "yes"? Note that those characters can also refer to the start and end of <i>lines</i>, in multiline mode.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually you can create lots of nonsense regular expressions.   Putting "start of input" (<code>^</code>) in the middle is just one of many possibilities.  Another would be sth like <code>()*</code> (empty string repeated any number of times).  Some nonsense-patterns are found and complained about (e. g. <code>a{6,3}</code>, <code>a**</code>), others are silently accepted and will either match anything or nothing, depending on their nature.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Sir for such detailed information. Can you please let me know, about the cases, where it's possible to create optional groups and have ^ match the middle of string, which you have mentioned in your answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ManguSinghRajpurohit; I meant that a pattern can have the <code>^</code> in the middle and still match. <code>r'[abc]*^start'</code> can match, for example, because the pattern before the <code>^</code> can match the empty string.</span>
