<p>If I use the following code:</p>
<pre><code>with open('examplefile.csv') as tst:
    for line in tst:
        x = line
        print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>I see 5 columns and numerous rows. </p>
<p>How do I take one row at a time and set variables to each item in a row?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The for loop already takes one line at a time </p>
<p>Split the line into a list. </p>
<p>Assuming comma is the delimiter, this assigns variables to each column </p>
<pre><code>x, y, z, a, b = line.split(',')
print(x)
</code></pre>
<p><em>This also assumes you don't have nested commas within columns</em></p>
<p>For a better solution please see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code> module</a> </p>
<p>Note: Pandas has more useful functions for CSV manipulation </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the csv module:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open('examplefile.csv') as tst:
    reader = csv.reader(tst, delimiter=',')
    for line in reader:
        # line is a delimiter-delimited line in your file
</code></pre>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is the right way of doing it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The better way is using a DictReader, though <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does this work for cell entries escaped by quotes with commas inside? For instance line ="\"City\", \"Austin, TX\"".  Expected 2 cells.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MFisher I appreciate you  using my current city, but does the question show such data?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I guess we are neighbors then. :) The question is general. I don't consider myself a "python guy" so I'm curious. This is probably why I'd advise using the built in functions instead of splitting on a comma. I've been burned doing this (splitting on commas) in production code (not python).</span>
