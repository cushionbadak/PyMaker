<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Suppose there is a list <code>['Hello','@sdfss','sdfh787s','World']</code>.
How to delete all the words which contain non-alphabetic in this list?
Using Regex in python.
The result should be </p>
<pre><code>['Hello','World']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't really need regular expressions, just <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>isalpha()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import re
s = ['Hello','@sdfss','sdfh787s','World']
s = [i for i in s if i.isalpha()]
print(s)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>['Hello', 'World']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For that you really don't need regex.  You can perform faster than re. But still if you want to do with re following is solution. </p>
<p>import re
s = ['Hello','@sdfss','sdfh787s','World'] # copied from above solution 
print [i for i in s if re.match(r'[A-Za-z]+$', i) ]</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, why is regex a requirement; what's wrong with just <code>isalpha</code> here?</span>
