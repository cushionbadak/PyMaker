<p>So I'm creating a basic (my first project using python) game with python. there is a part where I put a random.choice. I want to refer back to the same random number that it picked so I wondered if it is possible to create a variable for that output. I've tried str = randomint(1,7) but that didnt give me the result I wanted.</p>
<pre><code># random module
import random
dice1 = ['1','2','3','4','5','6','7']
print (random.choice(dice1))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here is how you would generate and then store a random number in Python. If you want a number between two numbers use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.randint(a,b)</code></a>. Note that using randint will give you an int and not a string</p>
<pre><code>import random
number = random.randint(1,7)
print(number)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your use of random.choice is indeed giving you a random selection from your list dice1. You can store the return value of random.choice in a variable. </p>
<pre><code># random module
import random
dice1 = ['1','2','3','4','5','6','7']
random_number = random.choice(dice1)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Well what is the result you wanted?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You already have answers, but let me give some different advice: You're making a mistake many beginning programmers make by using strings for everything. Strings are slow and complicated; computers like numbers. Try to train yourself to avoid strings unless they are really necessary.</span>
