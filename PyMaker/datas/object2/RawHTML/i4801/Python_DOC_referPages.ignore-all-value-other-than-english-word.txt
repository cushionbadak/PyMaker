<p>Write a function called letter_count(filename) that accepts a single parameter containing the name of a file.  Your function should read the contents of the text file, and calculate the number of times each English letter appears in the file. The function should print a list of (character : count) pairs to the standard output. </p>
<p>You may define additional “helper” functions as you wish. Any character that is not an English letter should be ignored. The case should be ignored (so both ’a’ and ’A’ count as the letter ’a’). Report the output with lower case letters.  The letters should be sorted into standard alphabetical order and should be printed in the format letter, then a space, then a colon, then a space, then the frequency.</p>

<p>I'm struggling to get the result same as the image, which I supposed to get only alphabet and ignore other value. However, I'm able to ignore only number. Below is where I up to:</p>
<pre><code>def letter_count(filename):
f = open(filename, 'r')
content = f.read().lower()
data = content.split()

mydicts = {}
for letter in data:
    for i in letter:
        count = mydicts.get(i, 0)
        mydicts[i] = count + 1

mydicts_list = mydicts.keys()

for letter in sorted(mydicts_list):
    print(letter, ':', mydicts[letter])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> to do the counting work for you:</p>
<pre><code>import string
from collections import Counter

with open(filename) as f:
    char_counts = Counter(c for c in f.read().lower() if c in string.ascii_lowercase)
    for c in sorted(char_counts):
        print(c, char_counts[c])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Does your problem have anything to do with the part about sorting?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Requested from question, but I have solved this particular part.</span>
