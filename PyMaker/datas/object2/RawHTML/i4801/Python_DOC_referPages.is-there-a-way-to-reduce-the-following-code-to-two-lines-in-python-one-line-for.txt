<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>x=np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
y=[]
for i in x:
    for j in i:
        y.append((i, j))
</code></pre>
<p>The best I could do to get <code>y</code> in one-line python code is to define a 2d array and then flatten it</p>
<pre><code>y=np.ravel([[(i, j) for j in i] for i in x])
</code></pre>
<p>Is there better way to define <code>y</code>?</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain.from_iterable" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.chain.from_iterable</code></a> to flatten the 2d list.</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
from itertools import chain

x = np.arange(9).reshape((3, 3))
y = chain.from_iterable(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>x</code> looks like</p>
<pre><code>[[0 1 2]
 [3 4 5]
 [6 7 8]]
</code></pre>
<p>and <code>y</code> (when iterated or converted to list) looks like</p>
<pre><code>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>chain</code> function is really just undoing the <code>reshape</code>. So why not leave it out? </p>

<span class="comment-copy">You have it in one line, but you want it in two lines? Why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think they want a oneline which is clearer and/or more efficient</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I didn't make it clear. The <code>two lines</code> in title was supposed to mean one line for x and the other one for y</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show what your expected result is? Can you not just use <code>y = itertools.chain.from_iterable(x)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My initial intention was to obtain a list of pairs from a 2d array <code>x</code> so that I can use it to initialize a dictionary. The above code is just a simplified example, I know the <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> doesn't make some material sense here.</span>
