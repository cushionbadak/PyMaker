<p>Here's my script. I just need to format a multiline string. I tried using a dictionary in the format section but that didn't work either.</p>
<pre><code>import requests

payload = """[
  {
    "id":{id},
    "name": "{name}"
  }
]""".format(id="123", name="test")

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
r = requests.post("http://localhost:8080/employee", data=payload, 
headers=headers)
print(r.status_code, r.reason)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<ol>
<li><p>You have opening and closing brackets. Format interprets them as a placeholder, you as a dict. Its content is, as the error says, <code>\n    "id":{id}â€¦</code> and so on. If you do not mean <code>{</code> as a placeholder, double them.</p></li>
<li><p>You are trying to write json yourself. Don't to that. Use the <code>json</code> module:</p>
<pre><code>json.dumps({"id": "123", name: "test"})
</code></pre>
<p>Or even better: Let requests do that.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When using <code>format</code>, literal <code>{</code>'s and <code>}</code>'s need to be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">escaped by doubling them</a></p>
<pre><code>payload = """[
  {{
    "id":{id},
    "name": "{name}"
  }}
]

""".format(id="123", name="test")

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using %s instead of .format()</p>
<p>This works:</p>
<pre><code>import requests

payload = """[
  {'id':%s,'name': %s

headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
r = requests.post("http://localhost:8080/employee", data=payload,

print(r.status_code, r.reason)

<span class="comment-copy">Use the <code>json</code> module to avoid problems. In fact, <code>requests</code> can do that for you. Don't try and format a json string yourself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For the issue itself: escape the braces that aren't part of the formatting: <code>"""[\n  {{\n    "id"</code>...<code>\n  }}\n]"""</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you give an example?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's in the stdlib documentation for the json module, the requests documentation for how requests can take care of it by itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's usable as a work-around, but doesn't solve the actual underlying issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Evert: OP wrote in the question "I just need to format a multiline string" and I provided a way. I don't think the solution is incorrect and thus doesn't deserve the downvote!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Evert: Sorry, I don't understand which values I didn't quote. I pasted the code after I was successfully able to run the code on my machine. (Obviously 8080 returned "Connection refused" but there is no syntax error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Got it! nice catch</span>
