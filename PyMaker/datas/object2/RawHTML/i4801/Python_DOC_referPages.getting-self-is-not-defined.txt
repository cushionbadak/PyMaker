<p>I'm new to python actually and I have a func that will add and sort, so I wanted to print the sorted list table but i'm getting an error </p>

<p>This is the code - what am I doing wrong? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your method has to accept self as default parameter.
change addsort method signature as below.</p>
<p>Adding self as parameter makes the method available for all the objects/instances of the class.</p>
<pre><code>obj = App()
obj.addsort()


def addsort(self):
        self.mytable.append(['Evans', '4', '2:23.717'])
        print(self.sorted)
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't want addsort to be called/used by an instance, make it a class method and make sure it is not dependent on any of the self parameters.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You're missing the <code>self</code> as a parameter in the function. All the class functions must have <code>self</code> as the first parameter. Have a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2709821/what-is-the-purpose-of-self" title="what is the purpose of self">stackoverflow.com/questions/2709821/what-is-the-purpose-of-self</a></span>

<span class="comment-copy">Whoever has downvoted thanks instead of rather being helpful and tell what I did wrong as I am new to python. nice job.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I still get error though <a href="http://rextester.com/QIIN84372" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rextester.com/QIIN84372</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">create an instance of App before calling it. Check my updated answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see and all is well now</span>
