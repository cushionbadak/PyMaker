<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>New here and have been hunting around for the answer to this question. Working on a Project Euler question and attempting to add values of a function to a list using list.append, however nothing is being added to the list and I'm unsure why. Any help appreciated.</p>
<pre><code>    import math
    import logging
    %config Application.log_level="INFO"

    input = 600851475143
    factlist = []

    def factors(i):
        for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(input)) + 1):
            if(input%i == 0):
                factlist.append()
                print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>Have tried defining the list inside and outside of the loop but to no avail.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As I said in a comment, you need to actually call the function somewhere, and you also need to give an argument to <code>append</code> :</p>
<pre><code>import math
import logging
%config Application.log_level="INFO"

input_ = 600851475143

def factors(input_):
    factlist = []
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(input_)) + 1):
        if(input_%i == 0):
            factlist.append(i)

factlist = factors(input_)
</code></pre>
<p>Moreover, don't use the name <code>input</code> for a variable since it's a Python function.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to pass the element you want to append as a parameter to <code>append</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Pass the right argument:</p>
<pre><code>if(input%i == 0):
    factlist.append(i) #&lt;- i added
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>And of course, you need to call your function somewhere</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">First, the indentation is wrong: the <code>if</code> statement should be more indented than <code>for</code>, and the <code>for</code> more than <code>def</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Moreover: are you actually calling the function somewhere?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi louis, yes thats how I have it formatted, it just hasn't carried over to here. I call the function further in.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">ahhhh, right I see, so in order for the function to actually output any data I need to call it separately and not just "run" the code where I define the factor! Understood :) Thanks indeed guys! I have never done any real coding before so this is all new to me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Nils. I have tried this, however when I "print" the list it still contains no values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then you probably never call your function.</span>
