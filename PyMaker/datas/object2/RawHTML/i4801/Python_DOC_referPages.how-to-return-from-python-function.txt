<p>This is my first programming practice. I have a python function like this: </p>
<pre><code>sum = 0
def summation(a,b):
    sum = a+b
    return sum
</code></pre>
<p>and when I call function as </p>
<pre><code>summation(3,4)
</code></pre>
<p>It does not return anything. Why?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>sum = 10               # this is a variable called sum 
print(id(sum))         # prints a unique ID for the sum object

def summation(a,b): # this is a function with its own scope 
    sum = a+b          # this is a different variable also called sum
    print(id(sum))     # prints unique ID for the inner sum object
    return sum

sum = summation(1,3)  # now your 1st sum object is overwritten and holds the result of 3+4

print(sum)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>139971258264288 # unique id of the 1st sum variable
139971258264096 # thats the id of the other sum variable inside    def summation(a,b): ...
4   # and thats the result of the addition stored into the 1st sum variable

<span class="comment-copy">Your function is returning. What is more likely is that you are not printing the result. Try <code>print(summation(3, 4))</code> to see your result.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to send the result of the function to <code>stdout</code> if you want to see the result. So what @ColinRicardo</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you want the result of the function stored in a variable then do the following <code>sumthing = summation(3, 4)</code> your result will be stored in <code>sumthing</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I hope you are aware that your "inner" <code>sum</code> and your outer <code>sum</code>live in different scopes - they are not the same.</span>
