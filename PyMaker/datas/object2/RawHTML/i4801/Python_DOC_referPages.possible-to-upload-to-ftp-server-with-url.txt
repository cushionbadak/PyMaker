<p>I'm wondering if there is a library that would enable me to upload a file to a remote server via ftp. I know there is ftplib, but from what i can tell, it only allows uploading from your own files. So if I had a URL like,  <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/d/db/Donald_Duck_Iconic.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/d/db/Donald_Duck_Iconic.png</a> , could I make a program to directly download/upload this to my ftp server. Instead of first having to download it to my own computer, then upload it to the server.</p>
<p>Sorry for formatting I'm on mobile.</p>

<p>You can use requests to download the file, and put the content into a BytesIO for upload:</p>
<pre><code>from io import BytesIO
import requests

url = 'https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/d/db/Donald_Duck_Iconic.png'

response = requests.get(url)
f = BytesIO(response.content)
</code></pre>
<p>Then, <code>f</code> is a file-like object that is suitable for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html#ftplib.FTP.storbinary" rel="nofollow noreferrer">FTP.storbinary</a>.</p>
