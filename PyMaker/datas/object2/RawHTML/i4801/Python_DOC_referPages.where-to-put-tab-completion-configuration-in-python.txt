<p>The above link shows that the following code can be used for autocompletion in python.</p>
<pre><code>import readline
import rlcompleter
if 'libedit' in readline.__doc__:
    readline.parse_and_bind("bind ^I rl_complete")
else:
    readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")
</code></pre>
<p>But I don't see where to put it so that it can be loaded at startup. I tried <code>~/.pythonrc</code>, but it did not work.</p>
<p>Does anybody know what is the current way to load such a configuration automatically for an interactive python session?</p>

<p>You need to set <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONSTARTUP" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PYTHONSTARTUP</a> environment variable to ~/.pythonrc. Put <code>PYTHONSTARTUP=~/.pythonrc</code> into your .bash_profile</p>

<p>Actually, there is no need to set <code>~/.pythonrc</code>. For Mac, one just needs to set <code>~/.editrc</code> with the following content. </p>
<pre><code>bind -v
bind ^I rl_complete
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Python 2 or 3? This should happen automatically on Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can do that, but it's going to affect a lot more than just Python if you do. That may be a good thing or a bad thing.</span>
