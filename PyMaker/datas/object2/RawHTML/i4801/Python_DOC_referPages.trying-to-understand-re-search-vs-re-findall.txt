<p>I'm trying to understand a seemingly easy case while learning regular expressions.</p>
<p>Suppose I have a code like this:</p>
<pre><code>import re

a = "Eventin queue contains 5 elements, first element is 20 minutes old"
b = re.search(r"Eventin queue contains \d+ elements, first element is \d+ minutes old", a)
print(b)
</code></pre>
<p>For some reason, <code>b</code>only returns this result: <code>&lt;_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 66), match='Eventin queue contains 5 elements, first element &gt;</code></p>
<p>As you can see, it's not a full result that I was expecting. However, if I use <code>re.findall()</code> I get <code>['Eventin queue contains 5 elements, first element is 20 minutes old']</code></p>
<p>Am I misunderstanding something here? Shouldn't <code>re.search()</code> return the full match as well?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The method <code>re.findall</code> returns a list of matched substrings, but the method <code>re.search</code> returns a <code>match</code> object, you can recover the full matched substring like this.</p>
<pre><code>b.group() # 'Eventin queue contains 5 elements, first element is 20 minutes old'
</code></pre>
<p>What you were seeing, <code>&lt;_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 66), match='Eventin queue contains 5 elements, first element &gt;</code>, is only a representation of the object.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you take a look at docs?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>re.search</code> returns <i>a match object</i> or <code>None</code>. This is clearly documented. <code>re.findall</code> returns a <i>list of <code>str</code> objets</i>. Again, this is clearly documented.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The representation (i.e. printing) of the match object doesn't show you everything that matched, you need to query it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you search SO before asking the question? <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/180986/what-is-the-difference-between-re-search-and-re-match/180993">what-is-the-difference-between-re-search-and-re-match</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8110059/python-regex-search-and-findall">python-regex-search-and-findall</a>? <b>Research first</b>, then ask.Please go over <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">how to ask</a> and read it.

<span class="comment-copy">Well this is embarrassing. Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Happens to us all, but the re module is very well documented, I encourage you to read the doc for further questions: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/re.html</a></span>
