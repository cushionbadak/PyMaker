<p>I started making a project that is showing which bands I like, then ask what artist/band's albums they want to see rated by me. I've got it to show what albums I like but then whenever I try to get Python to show how I rated each song in a specific album for the band/artist, it doesn't do anything. It just ends. </p>
<p>What is happening and how do I fix it?</p>
<p>Also how do I convert the <code>album = input("\nWhich album would you like to see the songs rated?")</code> to be only lowercase so it is easier? Like if it ask <em>Which album would you like to see the songs rated?</em> and I put <code>Vessel</code>, won't Python not interpret the list name and not paste the list? </p>
<pre><code>import time

top_albums = ["1.) Vessel", "2.) Regional at Best", "3.) Twenty One 
Pilots", "4.) Blurryface"]

twenty_one_pilots = ["Example 1"]
regional_at_best = ["Example 2"]
vessel = ["Example 3"]
blurryface = ["Example 4"]

for top_album in top_albums:
    print(top_album)

time.sleep(2)

album = input("\nWhich album would you like to see the songs rated?")


if album == twenty_one_pilots:
    print(twenty_one_pilots)

elif album == regional_at_best:
    print(regional_at_best)

elif album == vessel:
    print(vessel)

elif album == blurryface:
    print(blurryface)
</code></pre>

<p><code>python</code> doesn't interpret strings as code, meaning that your code won't run as expected. To do what you want, perform <code>eval()</code> on <code>album</code>.</p>
<p>In regard to your second question, use <code>.lower()</code> to convert the string to lowercase like this:</p>
<pre><code>album = input("â€¦").lower()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to get the contents of a list based on the list name, it may be more appropriate to use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionary</a>.  Minimal example:</p>
<pre><code>my_bands = { "vessel" : ["album 1", "album 2"], "21 pilots" : ["album 1", "album 2"] }

band = input("\nEnter a band name to see their albums: ")

print(my_bands[band])
</code></pre>
<p>To include ratings, your lists can be lists of tuples with album names and ratings, for example.  But hopefully this can get you started in the right direction.</p>
<p>As has been said elsewhere, you can use <code>.lower()</code> on a string to convert to lowercase.  So the last line above would be <code>print(my_bands[band.lower()])</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You're comparing a string an a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Strings you enter into <code>input()</code> are <i>not variable references</i>. You are given a <i>string</i>, so <code>album = 'vessel'</code>, not the list object. You probably want to learn about <i>dictionaries</i> instead. And about <code>str.lower()</code> to produce a lowercased version of a string.</span>
