<p>According to Python documentation, implementing a class in C for Python can be roughly divided into three steps:  </p>
<ol>
<li>defining the Object (the data impl)  </li>
<li>defining the Type (the behavior wrapper)  </li>
<li>defining concrete behaviors, and set them into corresponding <code>tp_xx</code> slots  </li>
</ol>
<p>For <code>new</code> function, <code>init</code> function, instance members, attributes, and even <code>dealloc</code>, all of them can be found a <strong>slot</strong> in <code>PyTypeObject</code> declaration, like <code>tp_new</code>, <code>tp_init</code>, <code>tp_members</code>, <code>tp_methods</code> and <code>tp_dealloc</code>. But there is not a slot like <code>tp_statics</code>. </p>
<p>Where should I declare the static variables and where should I set them up? I searched for the internet but got nothing. Could anyone give me a clue about this?</p>

<p>Maybe you should check out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2374334/static-variables-in-python-c-api">this question</a>.</p>
<p>There is no <code>static</code> keyword in Python, class attributes are stored in <code>class.__dict__</code>.</p>

<p>@avram has mentioned an answer which solved my problem.<br/>
But for anyone who found that your static attributes does not get updated after modification, you may check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/type.html#c.PyType_Modified" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PyType_Modified</a> function.  </p>
