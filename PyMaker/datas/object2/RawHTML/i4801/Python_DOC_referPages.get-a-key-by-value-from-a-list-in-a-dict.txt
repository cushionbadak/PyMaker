<p>I need to get a key from a dict, but the corresponding value is a list and I only have one value (one element) of the list. I already found </p>
<pre><code>mydict = {'george':[(16,16), 17],'amber':19}
print(list(mydict.keys())[list(mydict.values()).index((16,16))])
</code></pre>
<p>but this doesn't work, as it produces an value error because of the target value being only one element of the list. </p>
<p>How can I get the key only using one element of the list (using only the (16,16)? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The part you're missing is how to find a given value in a list: it's the <code>in</code> operator.</p>
<pre><code>target = (16, 16)
mydict = {'george':[(16,16), 17],'amber':19}
[k for k, v in mydict.items() if type(v) == list and target in v]
</code></pre>
<p>This is the long way to write the comprehension and filter, but it makes the steps obvious.</p>

<p>Dictionarys are great if you need a value by key, not so great the other way around. You can always iterate over the dicts items:</p>
<pre><code>mydict = {'george':[(16,16), 17],'amber':19}

for key,val in mydict.items(): # decomposed tuple of key,value
    if isinstance(val,list) and val[0] == (16,16): # check if value a list and 1st elem ok
        print (key) # print key
</code></pre>

<p>Why you are using only a part of the list?
Small modification in your code:</p>
<pre><code>print(list(mydict.keys())[list(mydict.values()).index([(16, 16), 17])])
</code></pre>
<p>prints george as expected.
Works with python 3.6.0</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Try: [(16, 16), 17] instead of <code>(16,16)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your example is weird - what do you want to print? The value of the key 'george' ? The first element of the value of  'george' ? Please go over <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionarys</a> and play around with them. The key whichs value-lists first value is (16,16) ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, that was exactly what i was looking for!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Im sorry i was too vague, I edited the question so you can understand what I meant</span>
<span class="comment-copy">More precise after the edition :) So I think @Prune answer is the one you're looking for.</span>
