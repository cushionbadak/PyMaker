<p>Working on a project where we have been provided three csv files (by city name). Project requires to write an interactive code where if a user specifies a city, the full pathname of the city shows up. </p>
<pre><code>def get_city():
    '''Asks the user for a city and returns the filename for that city's bike share data.

    Args:
        none.
    Returns:
        (str) Filename for a city's bikeshare data.
    '''
    city = input('\nHello! Let\'s explore some US bikeshare data!\n'
                 'Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?\n')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I assume you have a specific folder or list of folders where all the files are stored. Because they are named like the city and this should be the user input all you need is to combine the path with the user input and the file extension.</p>
<pre><code>def return_path(city):
    fname = city.lower() + '.csv'
    path = os.path.join(path, fname)
    return path
</code></pre>
<p>In case you have a list of paths you can search them using a for loop. If you want to search a folder for a given name or if you want to do anything with the content of the file please specify your question.</p>
