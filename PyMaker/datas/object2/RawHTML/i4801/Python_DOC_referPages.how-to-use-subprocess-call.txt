<p>I'm using <code>subprocess.call</code> on windows and in order to execute the following code I have to add the arg <code>shell=True</code> and can't use <code>shell=False</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.call("F:\\A_1000_Times.mp4" , shell=True)
exit()
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever I use <code>shell=False</code> it returns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WindowsError: [Error 193] %1 is not a valid Win32 application</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could someone be able to tell me what the problem is?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your error is telling it all: <code>WindowsError: [Error 193] %1 is not a valid Win32 application</code>. You are providing a <code>.mp4</code> file which is not an executable per se. What you are trying to do is start the default application associated with the extension <code>.mp4</code> in your os and have it play that file. For this the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.startfile" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.startfile</a> method exists:</p>
<pre><code>os.startfile("F:\\A_1000_Times.mp4")

<span class="comment-copy">Hi yousef, welcome to SO. There is a simple reason why you are not allowed to upload images as a new user: Don't include images of your code, instead paste it into your question and use the code formatting button to indent it automatically by four spaces</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for your comment but i don't understand  why not to paste a picture of my code it's much easier. for the second time thank you for your attention</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is much easier and convenient for you, but makes it much more complicated for someone to just take your code and run it on their computer. Read up on it <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/285551/why-not-upload-images-of-code-on-so-when-asking-a-question">here</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you very much. it worked perfectly. but can you tell me what <code>subprocess.call</code> do . i read about it but i didn't git it especially after what you said it made me confused.</span>
