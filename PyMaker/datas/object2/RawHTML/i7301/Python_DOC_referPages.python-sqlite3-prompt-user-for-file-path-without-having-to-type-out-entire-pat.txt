<p>I am very new to python but i tried making a small program which imports a CSV into a sqlite3 database and matches column values with pdf names - creating folders and filling them with said pdfs. </p>
<p>I'm currently using</p>
<pre><code>real_file_path = '/'.join(__file__.split('/')[:-1])
</code></pre>
<p>to get the directory where the executable file exists and using real_file_path + "specific file name" to import my CSV and find my folder with pdfs which are in the same folder as the executable file. </p>
<p>See example</p>
<pre><code>new_map_path = real_file_path + "/New_map"

real_file_path + '/Db_CSVinput/mapsCSV.csv'
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to prompt a user for the path for both the CSV file and the folder with pdfs, without them having type in the entire path?</p>

<p>You can use <code>pathlib</code> if using Python 3.4+:</p>
<pre><code>from pathlib import Path

csv = input('Please enter a csv filename: ')  # some_file.csv
pdf = input('Please enter pdf directory: ')  # some_directory

csv_file = next(Path('.').glob(f'**/{csv}'))  # Returns generator
pdf_path = next(Path('.').glob(f'**/{pdf}'))  # Returns generator
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the documentation for the library, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pathlib</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use <code>pathlib.Path.resolve()</code>, however I've had some issues using it, which is why I use the implementation in the code provided.</p>
