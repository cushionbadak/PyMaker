<p>When running the code below, I get 'None' output when running code from 
IDLE, but I get the full text output (correct output) when running from 
my command prompt. Why is this the case? Am I utilizing Pool wrong? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're using <code>Pool.map</code> correctly. However, it's a known problem that <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code> will not work with interactive interpreters like IDLE. This is documented <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#using-a-pool-of-workers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> underneath the example.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I know IDLE uses a redirect to push sys.stdout messages to its window.  In command prompt, every message goes to the command window.  In IDLE, not every message is redirected to the IDLE window.  I've yet to find a total list of default output objects, but I've seen and had to adjust to this behavior before in IDLE.  That's not much help, hence in comments :)</span>
