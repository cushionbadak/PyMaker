<p>I'm trying to build an array of products and build material using numpy but I'm having difficulty trying to determine the best layout for the array.</p>
<p>The array will consist of a list of products, raw material, and if a product requires another product for it to be built and list that required products raw material.</p>
<p>Ideally, the user would type in a product name and the program will return the Raw Material needed, and if another product is required.</p>
<p>For example: If I want to build a desk the program would lookup Desk in the array and tell me that I need: 3 pieces of lumber, 10 nails, and 1 gallon of paint. But, since nails are also a product by itself it would tell me that I need 1lbs of iron.</p>
<p>I see the outline as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Products: Desk</li>
<li>Raw Material: Lumber x 3, Paint x 1</li>
<li>Required Products: Nails x 10</li>
<li>Required Products Raw Material: Iron x 1</li>
</ul>
<p>What would be the best way to build the array?</p>
<p>There currently isn't any code to share since I'm still planning how, and what, the best approach is to the array, if an array is appropriate at all.</p>

<p>Thank you for all your input. I've looked into using a dictionary as suggested by juanpa.arrivillage and hpaulj. Using a python dictionary turned out to be the way to go.</p>
<p>The resources I used for dictionaries is:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You want to use <i>strings</i>? <code>numpy</code> arrays may not be an good choice. Your best bet sounds like a dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This question would be clearer and improved if you showed some code of how you want to use the data structure.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This isn't a <code>numpy</code> array application.  Arrays are best for homogeneous numeric data; mathematical arrays, not general tables or databases.  I'd start with Python dictionaries, and may be move on to a database (<code>sqlite3</code> comes builtin).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This does not answer the question at all. The OP asks about <code>numpy</code> arrays, not the built-in <code>array.array</code>. Furthermore, you simply provide a link to the docs, which isn't helpful.</span>
