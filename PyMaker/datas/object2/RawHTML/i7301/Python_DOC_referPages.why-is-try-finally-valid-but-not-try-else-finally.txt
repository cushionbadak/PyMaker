<p>I found Python throwing a SyntaxError at me for trying <code>try</code> without <code>except</code>:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    spam()
else:
    eggs()
finally:
    semprini()
</code></pre>
<p>Instead, I was forced to write:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    spam()
except:
    raise
else:
    eggs()
finally:
    semprini()
</code></pre>
<p>which felt slightly silly, but I want <code>eggs()</code> to be executed <em>before</em> <code>semprini()</code> â€” if I put the contents of the <code>else:</code>-clause after the <code>finally:</code>-clause it will be executed <em>after</em> <code>semprini()</code>.  Although there has been a <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2009-April/004298.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>try</code> without <code>except</code> proposal</a> in the past, the semantics were different as there the implication was <code>except: pass</code>, i.e. the polar opposite of what I'm after.  Interestingly, <code>try:</code> without either <code>except:</code> <em>or</em> <code>else:</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">is valid</a>, but I can't have <code>else:</code> if I don't also have <code>except:</code>.  Although there may be a different way to formulate the same, the alternatives I've thought of (probably) have subtly different behaviour.</p>
<p>Why does the presence of <code>else:</code> require the presence of <code>except:</code>?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should have written</p>
<pre><code>try:
    spam()
    eggs()
finally:
    semprini()
</code></pre>
<p>In the absence of any <code>except</code> clauses, <code>else</code> is useless.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>try:</code> without <code>except:</code> <i>must</i> have a <code>finally:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TemporalWolf I can see that from the grammar, but I wonder why.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I assume because <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">explicit is better than implicit</a>: you must specify something (even if that something is nothing) if you tell python you think this may throw an exception.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TemporalWolf and either way, the <code>SyntaxError</code> is not because <code>finally:</code> is missing, but because <code>except:</code> is missing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>else</code> in this context means something like <code>if not except</code>, thus it makes no sense without any <code>except</code> clause</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is that completely identical, though?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@gerrit: The only difference between the <code>try</code> and <code>else</code> clauses of a <code>try</code> statement is whether the <code>except</code> clauses apply to them. You don't <i>have</i> any <code>except</code> clauses.</span>
