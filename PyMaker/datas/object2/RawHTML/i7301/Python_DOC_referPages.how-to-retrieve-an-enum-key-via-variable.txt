<p>I'm new to python. Is it possible to get the value of an <code>Enum</code> key from a variable key? </p>
<pre><code>class Numbering(Enum):
 a=2
 b=3

key=b
print(Numbering.key)
#the result I want is 3
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One of the many neat features of Python's <code>Enum</code>s is retrieval by name:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(Numbering[k])
Numbering.b
</code></pre>
<p>and for the value:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(Numbering[k].value)
3
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I've (quickly, I admit) searched for obvious duplicates but couldn't find a proper one so all have an upvote.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I bet not to use <code>Enum</code> at all. You can easily maintain a <code>dict</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, i was hoping to find the duplicate as well (i know there must be plenty, maybe the choice of a title is what's different). i know how to do this in C#  Enum.Parse(typeof(EnumNameHere), KeyVal); but since I'm new to python I haven't found a reliable documentation source yet.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@adamkim The official Python docs are actually very good, for example: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#programmatic-access-to-enumeration-members-and-their-attributes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a></span>
