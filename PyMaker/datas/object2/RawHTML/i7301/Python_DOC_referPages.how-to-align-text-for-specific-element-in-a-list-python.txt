<p>ok Im trying to take the contents from another file and parse them.</p>
<p>So my Columns look like this after parsing:</p>
<pre><code>Data|   Pin   |  Time   |  Delay  |
800 |   address |  15  |   23
</code></pre>
<p>How can I make the text look like this:</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>is it possible to have this format:</p>
<pre><code>Data |        Pin        |  Time  |  Delay  |
800  |   LONG PIN NAME   |   16   |   15    |
</code></pre>
<p>Each column aligment should be different based on the lenght of string.</p>
<p>I know I can use <code>.split('|')</code> to make the lines into a list but how to I make it so that each column uses a specific number of spaces and does not go pass that. So for example:</p>
<pre><code>for lines in file:
    #align lines
    #write lines. align to new file
</code></pre>
<p>this will then be sent from unix to outlook email, so for some reason the columns always get unaligned in unix if one element in a column is too long and they are always out of aligment in outlook.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>str.format</code> and specify a justification:</p>
<pre><code>In [199]: lines = '''Data|   Pin   |  Time   |  Delay  |
     ...: 800 |   address |  15  |   23 |'''.splitlines()

In [200]: for line in lines:
     ...:     print('|'.join(['{:^10}'.format(x) for x in map(str.strip, line.split('|'))])
     ...: )
     ...:     
   Data   |   Pin    |   Time   |  Delay   |          
   800    | address  |    15    |    23    |    
</code></pre>
<p>You need to first split on <code>|</code>, then strip each item to remove extraneous whitespace. You can then apply the formatting and join on <code>|</code> once again.</p>
<p>Do not mix tabs and spaces.</p>
<hr/>
<p>For variable spacing, you can create a spacing list and pass it to the string inside, like this:</p>
<pre><code>spacing = [10, 20, 8, 8]

for line in lines:
    print('|'.join([('{:^%d}' %sp).format(x) for sp, x in zip(spacing, map(str.strip, line.split('|')))]))

   Data   |        Pin         |  Time  | Delay  
   800    |      address       |   15   |   23   
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The <code>'{:^10}'</code> needs to be wide enough to accomodatre the longest string being printed. - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Format String Syntax</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wwii Indeed. The 10 was just an estimate. I assume OP would make the change if needed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is perfect but for example data has a maximum of 6 numbers and pin name could be 15 characters is there a way to not have to use 15 characters to align all of them as a colum for example  Column one could be   800 |     PIN_NAME_LONG |   800  | ANOTHER LONG NAME |</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexanderVelez Yeah. You could do something like store your desired widths in a list, and then you can zip the line and the width list, and set the width dynamically inside the list comp.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexanderVelez Look at my edit.</span>
