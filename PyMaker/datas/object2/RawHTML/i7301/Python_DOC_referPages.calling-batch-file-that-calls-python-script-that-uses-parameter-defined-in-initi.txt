<p>I've two batch files, A.bat and B.bat, as well as a python script C.py<br/>
A.bat looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>call B.bat hello
</code></pre>
<p>Now of course, if I use %1 in B.bat, the batch file will view that value as "hello". Now, if I have B.bat call C.py, I need C.py to be able to recognize that %1 is hello, the same way B.bat recognizes that.<br/>
Of course, I've tried simply writing in B.bat:</p>
<pre><code>call C.py %1
</code></pre>
<p>And then using %1 in C.py like I would in any batch file, but this did not work. I don't know if this means that I can't use %1 itself as a parameter or if I can't use a parameter of this type in python, or both. So, how would I be able to use a parameter in C.py that was defined in A.bat?</p>

<p>To access parameters in Python, use:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
print(sys.argv[1])  # view the first parameter, similar to %1 in .bat
</code></pre>
