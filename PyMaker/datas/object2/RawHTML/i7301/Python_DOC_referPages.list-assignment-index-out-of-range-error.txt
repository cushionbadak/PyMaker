<p>I'm trying to create a simple array program and print out the array elements but getting an error right after I input employee 2 value saying: IndexError: list assignment index out of range. </p>
<pre><code>#Create constant for the number of employees.
SIZE = 3

#Create an array to hol the number of hours worked by each employee.
hours = [SIZE]

#Get the hours worked by employee 1.
hours[0] = int(input("Enter the hours worked by employee 1: "))

#Get the hours worked by employee 2.
hours[1] = int(input("Enter the hours worked by employee 2: "))

#Get the hours worked by employee 3.
hours[2] = int(input("Enter the hours worked by employee 3: "))

#Display the values entered.
print("The hours you entered are:")
print(hours[0])
print(hours[1])
print(hours[2])
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Python doesn't have literal arrays: it has lists. <code>hours = [SIZE]</code> doesn't create a list with 3 elements: it creates a list with 1 element. You should use <code>append()</code> to add items to a list, not indexing past the end of the array.</p>
<p>The correct code would look something like this to add elements to the list:</p>
<pre><code>hours.append(int(input("Enter the hours worked by employee 1: ")))
hours.append(int(input("Enter the hours worked by employee 2: ")))
hours.append(int(input("Enter the hours worked by employee 3: ")))
</code></pre>
<p>From the comments, it seems you're learning code from a pseudocode textbook: that's wonderful. Just remember though that certain conventions common to pseudocode, or sometimes C-like languages may be different in other programming languages. For example, in C, this declares an array of 50 chars named <code>x</code>.</p>
<pre><code>char x[50];
</code></pre>
<p>In Python, you cannot use the same syntax. Good luck.</p>

<p>You seem to have the wrong idea on how arrays work in Python. Essentially what you're doing when you typed</p>
<pre><code>#Create constant for the number of employees.
SIZE = 3

#Create an array to hol the number of hours worked by each employee.
hours = [SIZE]
</code></pre>
<p>Is create an array with <strong>one</strong> element with a value of 3</p>
<pre><code>hours = [3]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">you're not setting any size with <code>hours = [SIZE]</code>, your list has only one index</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>[SIZE]</code> is a 1-element list whose only element is the number 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I'm learning programming logic and they use pseudocode which I'm trying to translate over to python code as I go.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python actually does have arrays <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/array.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cricket_007 Yes I know, also, NumPy is literally based on them. But not literal arrays. I should probably mention that. Thanks.</span>
