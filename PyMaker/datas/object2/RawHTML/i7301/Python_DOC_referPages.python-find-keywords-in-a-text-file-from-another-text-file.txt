<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Take this invoice.txt for example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Invoice Number</p>
<p>INV-3337</p>
<p>Order Number</p>
<p>12345</p>
<p>Invoice Date</p>
<p>January 25, 2016</p>
<p>Due Date</p>
<p>January 31, 2016</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is what dict.txt looks like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Invoice Date</p>
<p>Invoice Number</p>
<p>Due Date</p>
<p>Order Number</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am trying to find keywords from 'dict.txt' in 'invoice.txt' and then add it and the text which comes after it (but before the next keyword) in a 2 column datatable.</p>
<p>So it would look like :</p>
<p>col1       -----                 col2</p>
<p>Invoice number  ------            INV-3337</p>
<p>order number       ----         12345</p>
<p>Here is what I have done till now</p>
<pre><code>with open('C:\invoice.txt') as f:
    invoices = list(f)

with open('C:\dict.txt') as f:
    for line in f:
        dict = line.strip()
        for invoice in invoices:
            if dict in invoice:
                print invoice
</code></pre>
<p>This is working but the ordering is all wrong (it is as in dict.txt and not as in invoice.txt)</p>
<p>i.e.
The output is </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Invoice Date</p>
<p>Invoice Number</p>
<p>Due Date</p>
<p>Order Number</p>
</blockquote>
<p>instead of the order in the invoice.txt , which is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>invoice number</p>
<p>order number</p>
<p>invoice date</p>
<p>due date</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you help me with how I should proceed further ?</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should work. You can load your invoice data into a list, and your dict data into a set for easy lookup.</p>
<pre><code>with open('C:\invoice.txt') as f:
    invoice_data = [line.strip() for line in f if line.strip()] 

with open('C:\dict.txt') as f:
    dict_data = set([line.strip() for line in f if line.strip()])
</code></pre>
<p>Now iterate over invoices, 2 at a time and print out the line sets that match.</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(0, len(invoice_data), 2):
    if invoice_data[i] in dict_data:
        print(invoive_data[i: i + 2])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are your files small?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry for the late reply : yes they are</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the output comes out weird like this : " ['Invoice Date\n', '\n'] "   and it did not recognize "Order Number"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jokol It seems you have extra newlines. Check my edit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It works ! Thank you so much !</span>
