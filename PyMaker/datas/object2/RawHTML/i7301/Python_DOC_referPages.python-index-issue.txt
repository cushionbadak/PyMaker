<p>Below is the code. Why is it behaving so? What is the alternative?</p>
<pre><code>line2 = ["a", "b","c","d","e","f","g","a","c", "d","e","g","h",]

for x in line2:
    print("X value is:", x, " and its index is:", line2.index(x))
</code></pre>
<p>Output is:</p>
<pre><code>X value is: a  and its index is: 0
X value is: b  and its index is: 1
X value is: c  and its index is: 2
X value is: d  and its index is: 3
X value is: e  and its index is: 4
X value is: f  and its index is: 5
X value is: g  and its index is: 6
X value is: a  and its index is: 0
X value is: c  and its index is: 2
X value is: d  and its index is: 3
X value is: e  and its index is: 4
X value is: g  and its index is: 6
X value is: h  and its index is: 12
</code></pre>
<p>Why is it not incrementing ?. How do I resolve. I need increments of index ? Instead of index do we have something like position of X</p>

<p>Using that <code>index</code> call is <em>very</em> costly in each iteration, when you have it for free if you just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enumerate</a>. Furthermore, please be aware about how index works, in that you will always only ever get the first time the value comes up.</p>
<pre><code>for index, value in enumerate(line2):
     print("X value is:", value, " and its index is:", index)
</code></pre>
<p>In terms of <em>cost</em> of how your implementation, and this answer works. You can't really compare the functionality of <code>index</code>, with the functionality of <code>enumerate</code>. </p>
<p>Your first list is going to be <code>O(n)</code>, naturally because you are simply iterating through the entirety of your list. However, with <em>each</em> call to <code>index</code>, that in itself is going to be <code>O(n)</code>. That is huge in terms of inefficiency. </p>
<p>The <code>enumerate</code> iterates through your list once, providing a tuple result where the first value represents your index, and the second is simply the <em>next</em> value in your list, thus giving you just a <code>O(n)</code> complexity. Your <code>print</code> statement, therefore in the solution I am providing bears no cost, because you are simply just outputting the value you already have without any extra computation required. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">How can it know which <code>"c"</code> you are asking about? It is giving you the first one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doesnt X value increment for every iteration, { for x in line2} part?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>X</code> is the element of the list. Nothing to increment there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perhaps also mention that <code>list.index</code> finds the first occurrence of the target, and therefore ignores any subsequent occurrences (unless the optional parameter is specified)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@inspectorG4dget Oh right! silly. Yes I'll add that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So based on my understanding, using index is Expensive. Is enumerate less expensive.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@HyderTom You can't even really compare them. Let me update my question to explain this for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@HyderTom Updated. They two different functions entirely, and again, <code>index</code> is also not what you want to use in general because as explained it only gives you the index the first item it finds.</span>
