<p>Eg:</p>
<pre><code>ECE_student_list = [['section-1', [["sai",'science'], ["rama",'maths']]],
                ['section-2', [["seetha",'science'], ["ravana",'maths']]]]
</code></pre>
<p>I have to print student name and subject by passing key as section name.</p>
<p>for Eg : if the key is 'section-1'  first student then it should print "sai",'science'
second student ,then it should print "rama",'maths'</p>
<p>please share the logic in python.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Won't share the code directly. That you have to learn and experiment on your own. Although I can tell you what you can expect as your output.</p>
<p>You can create a dictionary in python and add section-1, section-2 as the keys and the list of students as value for each key.</p>
<p>Your dictionary structure will be something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  'section-1' : [
    {'sai':'science'},
    {'rama':'math'}
  ],
  'section-2':[
    {'sai':'science'},
    {'rama':'math'}
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Use a dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As mentioned, read about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionaries</a>. Play around with the code with that in mind, and then update your question with your own code attempt of this and explain what difficulties you are having.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah thank you  for the reply. please share cod for that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please write some code of your own then ask why it isn't working - unless, of course, it does!</span>
