<p>I have a .txt file with entries separated by a newline and a comma, alternating.</p>
<pre><code>x = file_1.read().split("\n")
...
x = ['10,0902', '13897,00641']
</code></pre>
<p>how can I also delimit by a comma? <code>.split("\n" and ",")</code>
does not seem to work</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>.split("\n" and ",")</code> is the same as <code>.split(True)</code> which doesn't make much sense.</p>
<p>You'd want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re.split</a> so you can split by a regex:</p>
<pre><code>import re

string = '1,2\n3,4'

print(re.split(r'(?:\n|,)', string))
#  ['1', '2', '3', '4']
</code></pre>
