<p>I have a string: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[('I', 'PRP'), ('have', 'VBP'), ('lost', 'VBN'), ('a', 'DT'), ('pant', 'NN')]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I need to take the words in between single quotes in an <strong>array</strong>. as example: </p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code> array1[0] = I 
 array1[1] = PRP 
 array1[2] = have 
 array1[3] = VBP
 And so on ... 
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The number of entries <em>[assuming ('x', 'y') makes an entry]</em> is variable in the original string. And the array needs to be a <strong>string</strong> array, not something like numpy ndarray. Now, how to do that with <strong>Python</strong>?</p>
<p><em>I also have a List object just like the original string. If the same result can be achieved by processing the list object, that would also work fine.</em></p>

<pre><code>from itertools import chain

</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain.from_iterable" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>chain.from_iterable</code></a> does exactly what you'd think it does: it flattens the given iterable (converts nested structure into a chain).</p>

<p>It's same like make list of list into a single list,</p>
<pre><code>In [3]: lst = [('I', 'PRP'), ('have', 'VBP'), ('lost', 'VBN'), ('a', 'DT'), ('pant', 'NN')]
In [4]: print [i for j in lst for i in j]
Out[4]: ['I', 'PRP', 'have', 'VBP', 'lost', 'VBN', 'a', 'DT', 'pant', 'NN']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You have a list of tuples you need a nested loop to access the inner values</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The thing in your 1st codeblock is a list of tuples of strings. The arrays provided by the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>array</code></a> module are primarily designed to handle numerical data; they can be used to create arrays of chars, but not arrays of strings. I don't understand why you can't just construct a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list</a> of strings.</span>
