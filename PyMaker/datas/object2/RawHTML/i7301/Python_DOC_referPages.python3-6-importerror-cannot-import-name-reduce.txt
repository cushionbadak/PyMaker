<pre><code>from functools import reduce

<p>I'm using python 3.6.2, and this is the only code that shows the following error:   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "D:\Pythons\oop.py", line 50, in

  ImportError: cannot import name 'reduce'
  Process returned 1 (0x1)   execution time : 0.145 s</p>

<p>I will find this problem because I made a mistake in another code,   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>from enum import Enum</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It reported the error:   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "D:\Pythons\oop.py", line

<p>So I just looked at the <code>enum. Py</code> source,Found in line 3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>from functools import reduce</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, in centos7.2 installed python3.6.2 is completely out of any problems, but under the Windows 10 professional version installed, will appear these problems above, seems I installed out of the question, however, many times I've uninstalled, installed the many times repeatedly, still won't do, don't know without those documents, who can tell me how to through the command line in the Windows environment to install it?</p>

<p>Python 3.6 should have reduce in functools. To debug your problem, try this:</p>
<pre><code>import functools
for obj in dir(functools):

<p>My guess is more than reduce will be missing. In any case, it looks like an Uninstall than Reinstall is in order. You may have accidently edited the file or corrupted it in some way. Sometimes an IDE could take you to that function and it would be easy to edit it accidentally.</p>

<p>Don't take care of those errors. Just try to use <strong>functools</strong> in your code :</p>
<pre><code>import functools 

# Create a list of strings: stark
stark = ['robb', 'sansa', 'arya', 'eddard', 'jon']

# Use reduce() to apply a lambda function over stark: result
result = functools.reduce((lambda item1,item2:item1 + item2), stark)
</code></pre>
<p>or like that : </p>
<pre><code># Import reduce from functools
from functools import reduce

# Create a list of strings: stark
stark = ['robb', 'sansa', 'arya', 'eddard', 'jon']

# Use reduce() to apply a lambda function over stark: result
result = reduce((lambda item1,item2:item1 + item2), stark)

<span class="comment-copy">so python can't import <code>reduce</code> from <code>functools</code>. I can't find a class/method named reduce neither in python 3. <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/functools.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/functools.py</a> - this was in python 2 available <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html#functools.reduce" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html#functools.reduce</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That code works fine on <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python.org/shell</a> which uses version3.6.0. maybe reinstall, or do a full install with all python packages?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just installed 3.6.2 and I'm not able to replicate. <code>reduce</code> is even listed on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation page</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like you named a file something you shouldn't.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To clarify the comment from @user2357112, I've run into this error when I've created a file named <code>functools.py</code> in a location higher up on the path than the intended import. Rename the file you created called <code>functools.py</code>. If this is not the case, then your installation is likely bad.</span>
