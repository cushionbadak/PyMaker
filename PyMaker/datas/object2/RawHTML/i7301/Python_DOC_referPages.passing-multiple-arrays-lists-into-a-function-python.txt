<p>So as is, this doesn't work. I get an error about how I can't concatenate a list with a string. And obviously that's not what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to concatenate the constituents of both my lists (indexed the same so i can use the same counter). I just didn't want to use a for loop if I didn't have to.</p>
<p>I still need to do the matching index iterations of product_name</p>

<p>To iterate over the <code>original_loc</code> list items you have to use a for statement, but you don't use the right syntax, please read the tutorial about <code>for</code> statements at:  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>for i=1,i&lt;=N Items(original_loc),i++,</code> is not even a valid Python syntax</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't meant to include that line, I was asking someone in person that I work with if I would have to do something like a for loop.  But in any case, your answer is <i>so</i> helpful. &gt;.&gt; Thanks for all the helpful information leading me to a solution ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yup I got that. But if I attempt to do for i in original_loc: then I am only perofrming iterations over one of my lists. How do I do it for more than one?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can nest flow controls constructions. In the tutorial I linked to you there's an example with a nested if in the for statement. You can nest a <code>for</code> statement in a <code>for</code> statement so you can iterate over each products while iterating over each locations.</span>
