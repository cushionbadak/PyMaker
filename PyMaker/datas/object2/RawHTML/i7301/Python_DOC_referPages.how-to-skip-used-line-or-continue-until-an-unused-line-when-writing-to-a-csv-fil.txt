<p>I am trying to write information to a csv file.  It is inside a for loop that will change the data.  Basically what I want it to do is get data put it in a csv file and then it will loop get new data and put it in the same csv file, but it needs to continue where it left off from the last set of data and not replace it.</p>
<p>Here is what I have:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(0, 11):
    #Calling all the above functions
    soc_auth_requests()
    create_account()
    config_admin_create()
    account_user_create()
    account_activate()
    account_config_DNS_create()

    #Creating the dictionary for the CSV file with the data fields made and modified from before
    #It is necessary this be done after the above method calls to ensure the data field values are correct
    data = {
        'Account_Name': acc_name,
        'Account_Id': acc_id,
        'User_Email': user_email,
        'User_id': user_id
     }

    #Creating a csv file and writing the dictionary titled "data" to it

    outfile = open('Accounts_Details.csv', 'w')
    while('Accounts_Details.csv'.isspace() == False):
        outfile.readline()
    for key, value in sorted(data.items()):
        outfile.write('\t' + str(value) + '\n')
</code></pre>
<p>I can't give more than this,  But I can confirm it is parsing 10 times and the data is there.  How do I skip used lines or just continue where I left off?</p>
<p>Note:  It is important that each bit of information is on a newline.  Ex:</p>
<pre><code>id1
name1
id2
name2
.
.
.
</code></pre>
<p>Note:  I have tried many different threads and none of them apply to my situation nor explain enough for me to match them up, so I have been exploring options with no luck.</p>

<p>You can use the append <code>'a'</code> modifier when you open a file to write where you left off. For example:</p>
<pre><code>outfile = open('Accounts_Details.csv', 'a')
for key, value in sorted(data.items()):
    outfile.write('\t' + str(value) + '\n')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Open the file outside of the for loop</p>
<pre><code>with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
    for i in range(something):
        d = create_dict()
        for a, b in d.items():
            f.write('{}\t{}\n'.format(a, b)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">A few things.  First, this is not a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>.  Please remove extraneous code, like all the calls to <code>soc_auth_requests()</code>, <code>create_account</code>, etc.  As it stands, the code you've posted is not code others can reproduce.  Second, if you're writing each data field on a separate line, this is not a CSV file.  CSV means "comma separated values", and if it were csv, you'd print all associated values on a single row.  Third, your title mentions csvwriter, and your code doesn't show anything other than normal writing.  Have you looked at python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv</a> library?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or open the file outside of the for loop?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ScottMermelstein  well Scott for starters as I said I showed you as much as I can.  And its not extraneous code if its part of the section I am working on.  And it is a csv file but csv files can be organized differently.  I have looked at the library why else would I be asking the question in which I state: " I have tried many different threads and none of them apply to my situation nor explain enough for me to match them up, so I have been exploring options with no luck."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was unaware csvwriter was something different Ill change that then.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your help! I used the idea to put the open out of the for loop and it works now with help from the other guy as well.  Thanks so much for you help!</span>
