<p>I totally new in Python and stuck with this error:</p>
<p>I am trying to encode an image and then convert it to json to upload into a no-sql db. But when I am trying to convert it to json I am getting this error:</p>
<p>"AttributeError: 'bytes' object has no attribute '<strong>dict</strong>'"</p>
<p>Below is my python code:</p>
<pre><code>import base64  
import json



def jsonDefault(object):
    return object.__dict__


with open("img123.png", "rb") as imageFile:  
    str = base64.b64encode(imageFile.read())  
    print(str)  
json_str = {'file_name':'img123','img_str':str}  
pytojson = json.dumps(json_str, default=jsonDefault)  
print(pytojson)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That happens because you are trying to access a property that a <code>bytes</code> object doesn't have (<code>__dict__</code>). I understand that you need to return a format that can be serialized to JSON.</p>
<p>This works for me, but I don't know if it's the decoding you desire:</p>
<pre><code>def jsonDefault(o):
    return o.decode('utf-8')
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24369666/typeerror-b1-is-not-json-serializable">TypeError: b'1' is not JSON serializable</a> as well.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is your <code>jsonDefault</code> function supposed to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">jsonDefault is used to make it JSON Serialized as earlier I was getting that error when using json.dumps(json_str).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't encapsulates a _<b>binary</b>_Object into <code>json</code> Object`. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/45264158/edit">Edit</a> your Question and explain why you would want to do that.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">As I am new to Python, what can be effects of "decode" in this case if you please explain.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kuntal <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>bytes.decode</code></a> is used to return a string decoded from the given bytes. The problem is that you can't serialize a bytes object with JSON, so you need to transform it in some way. A string representation of the image is what you wanted, right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want to store an image in my Cloudant Database. I think only way to do that is to store the encoded string of the image as json. I am more than happy to try your suggestion .One question, could I face any problem if I try to create the image from this decoded string again ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kuntal have you tried for yourself to restore the image from the encoding? You should be able to use <code>base64.base64decode</code> to recover the image from the decoding. Please remember to mark the answer as accepted if it helped you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so far your solution works as a charm.Thanks a lot. I will try to get it back to image.</span>
