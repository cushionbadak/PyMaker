<p>I'm relatively new to using eclipse, and I'm trying to figure out how to use the Python.h includes that are described <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/extending/embedding.html#" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. What steps do I need to take to get eclipse to properly compile that include? Thanks!</p>
<p>Edit:
I am using Windows if that helps.</p>

<p>Ensure PyDev is installed as a plug-in. 
You can do this by selecting <code>Help&gt;Install New Software</code>
you will then select add and choose a name (eg. PyDev), 
then enter <code>http://pydev.org/updates</code> as a location.
You will then select <code>PyDev</code> from the list of available software and accept the license, and trust the certificate. 
You may need to restart Eclipse afterwards. </p>
<p>You can refer to this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Official Python Documentation</a> for additional information on embedding and extending your code. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">I followed your steps, and PyDev now appears installed in <code>Windows-&gt;Preferences</code>, but the error messages still persist. Am I missing anything? PyDev appears in the list on the left side. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FairlyFactual could you post the error message here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">eclipse gives the error message on <code>#include &lt;Python.h&gt;</code> as <code>Unresolved inclusion: &lt;Python.h&gt;</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay. I was messing around with my program a little in an attempt to fix the problem and eventually just decided to replace <code>&lt;Python.h&gt;</code> with <code>"C:\...Python.h"</code>, and the program started to work. I guess the problem was to do with eclipse not being able to find the include even though I installed it through the <code>Help&gt;Install New Software</code> method.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FairlyFactual always ensure your header files can be accessed during compiling.  So include the header file path like you did and it saves you from some nasty linker errors</span>
