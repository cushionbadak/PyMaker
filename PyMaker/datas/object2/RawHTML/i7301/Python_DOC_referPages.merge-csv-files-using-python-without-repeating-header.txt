<p>and getting </p>
<pre><code>File "/home/tcs/.config/spyder-py3/temp.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    fout.write(header)

TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know much about python please help
Also i want to know how to split 1 big csv into multiple csv with same header.</p>

<p>Using pandas:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

interesting_files = glob.glob("/home/tcs/PYTHONMAP/test1/*.csv") 
df = pd.concat((pd.read_csv(f, header = 0) for f in interesting_files))
df.to_csv("output.csv")
</code></pre>
<p>To get rid of duplicate rows as well:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

interesting_files = glob.glob("/home/tcs/PYTHONMAP/test1/*.csv") 
df = pd.concat((pd.read_csv(f, header = 0) for f in interesting_files))
df_deduplicated = df.drop_duplicates()
df_deduplicated.to_csv("output.csv")
</code></pre>
<p>This will not get rid of duplicates as the dataframe is created, but after. So a dataframe gets created by concatenating all of the files. Then it is de-duplicated. The final dataframe can then be saved to csv.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You are opening the <code>fout</code> file as binary by specifying <code>'wb'</code>. I think it should work if you specify <code>'w'</code> instead, for writing strings. You might also want to take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>csv</code> module</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot i did with system command also, can you describe how do we split large csv file into small size but header should be present in each split, Thanks in advance</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sed 2d *.csv &gt; /a2.csv . command is able to concat the same without python,</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShubhamChauhan it can't work It will with repeat header</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is there any way I can also remove duplicates simultaneously?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rahul do you mean duplicate rows? I've updated my answer to include a way to remove duplicate rows, hope this helps! :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks.........</span>
