<p>Evening Guys,</p>
<p>New to Python and wondering if someone can take a quick look at the beginning of a POS system I am working on. </p>
<p>I want the employee to have to enter their ID number to operate the system. So I placed the employee name and number in a dictionary. And tried to do an If/Else function to match the input against the Employee IDs. Any guidance is greatly appreciated. </p>
<pre><code>employee_IDs = {'Sam': 407427,
                'Bart': 101026,
                'Mike': 445002,
                }
employee_number = input('Employee ID: ')

if employee_number != employee_IDs:
    print("Invalid employee ID")
else:

    name = input('Enter Your Name: ')
    address = input('Enter Your Address: ')
    phone_number = input('Enter Your Phone Number: ')
    print('Hello', name,'!!! What would you like to order?')
    print("{:" "^80}".format(""))
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>There are a couple fundamental problems in your code that you should address.</p>
<p>The first thing to realize here is that the <code>input()</code> function will always return a string. With that in mind, if you actually compare string to an integer (you have an integer in your dictionary), you will never pass an equality check. </p>
<p>The second item to note, is that you never <em>actually</em> properly look to see if the data you want to validate is <em>in</em> your dictionary. </p>
<p>When you do this: </p>
<pre><code>employee_number != employee_IDs
</code></pre>
<p>You are not performing a proper containment check to see if your data is inside the dictionary. </p>
<p>If all you want to do is validate that the employee_id is <em>not</em> valid, then you need to check the <em>values</em> of the dictionary. This can be done by calling the <code>values</code> method against the dictionary, and then using the <em>containment</em> check <code>in</code>: </p>
<pre><code>if employee_id not in employee_IDs.values()
</code></pre>
<p>However, this won't work! Because <code>employee_id</code> is a <em>string</em> and your values are all integers, so you need to call <code>int</code> on the <code>employee_id</code> to actually compare the proper types with one another: </p>
<pre><code>if int(employee_id) not in employee_IDs.values()
</code></pre>
<p>I suggest you read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionary</a> documentation, and take the time to go through some of the relevant parts of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Tutorial</a>, which will greatly help your learning and solving some of these problems in your code. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are comparing a string to a dict, which will always fail. If you want to test if the input matches one of the numbers associated with the names in the dict, the test should be something like <code>if int(employee_number) in employee_IDs.values()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of </p>
<pre><code>if employee_number != employee_IDs:
</code></pre>
<p>you want to have </p>
<pre><code>if int(employee_number) not in employee_IDs.values():
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try like this:</p>
<pre><code>employee_IDs = {'Sam': 407427,
                'Bart': 101026,
                'Mike': 445002,
                }
employee_number = input('Employee ID: ')

try:
    if int(employee_number) not in employee_IDs.values():
        print("Invalid employee ID")
    else:
        name = input('Enter Your Name: ')
        address = input('Enter Your Address: ')
        phone_number = input('Enter Your Phone Number: ')
        print('Hello', name,'!!! What would you like to order?')
        print("{:" "^80}".format(""))
finally:
    print("Invalid employee ID")
</code></pre>
<p>the sample log like thisï¼š</p>
<pre><code>Employee ID: 407427
Enter Your Name: 21
Enter Your Address: 13212
Enter Your Phone Number: 54564
Hello 21 !!! What would you like to order?


Process finished with exit code 0
