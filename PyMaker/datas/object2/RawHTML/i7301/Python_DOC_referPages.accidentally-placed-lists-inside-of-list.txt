<p>When I run this file, everything seems to calculate correctly, except for the fact that I end up with the individual list elements inside of lists themselves. This makes it difficult to do some other operations I would like to perform on the individual parts of the list. </p>
<p>My code:</p>
<pre><code>growthslist = []
f = open("growths.txt",'r')
count = 0
for line in f:
    count+=1
charnum = int((count/9))
f.seek(0)
for i in range(count):
    growthslist.append(f.readline().splitlines())
namelist = []
namecounter = 0
for i in range(charnum):
    namelist.append(growthslist[namecounter])
    namecounter +=9
print(namelist)
</code></pre>
<p>When I run this code, it returns [['Test 1'], ['Test 2'], ['Test 3'], ['Test 4'], ['Test 5']].
Is there anything I can do about this?</p>

<p>This part:</p>
<pre><code>growthslist.append(f.readline().splitlines())
</code></pre>
<p>Is your problem. <code>str.splitlines()</code> returns a list. That's why you're seeing a list of lists, rather than a flat list. But you don't need <code>str.splitlines()</code> anyway since you're already using <code>file.readline()</code>. Just use that:</p>
<pre><code>growthslist.append(f.readline())
</code></pre>
<p>If you have extra whitespace you need to strip from the lines, use <code>str.strip()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>growthslist.append(f.readline().strip())
</code></pre>
<p>As noted in the comments by @idjaw, an alternately way to accomplish your goal would be to read the contents of the file, <em>then</em>  use <code>splitlines()</code> to separate each line removing any trailing whitespace:</p>
<pre><code>f.read().splitlines()
</code></pre>
<p>Also, consider using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with" rel="nofollow noreferrer">context manager statement <code>with</code></a>. It will ensure that your files will always be closed regardless of any errors or issues that arise during program execution.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>f.readline()</code> returns one line. No reason to split it. <code>.splitlines()</code> turns it into a list.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try this:</p>
<pre><code>f = [i.strip('\n') for i in open('filename.txt')]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You might find <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enumerate</a> useful in your code.  .... <code>for count, line in enumerate(f): ... </code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's weird, though, since when I use only f.readline, I get EOL characters. This is my output: <code>['Test1\n', 'Test2\n', 'Test3\n', 'Test4\n', 'Test5\n']</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Absolutely-disgusting I see. If you have extra whitespace, than use <code>str.strip()</code> to remove it. I'll update my answer to include this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright, thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Absolutely-disgusting Glad I could help out :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@idjaw I just tested and I believe you're right. Thanks. I'll add that to my answer.</span>
