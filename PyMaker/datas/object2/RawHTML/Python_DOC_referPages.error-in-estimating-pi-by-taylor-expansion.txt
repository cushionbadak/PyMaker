<p>I am trying to calculate the value of pi, but there is some semantic error in my logic which I am not able to figure out.</p>
<pre><code>def taylor(precision):
    iter = 1
    sum = 0
    fx = 100
    sign = 1

    while (abs(fx) &gt; precision):

        if not iter % 2 == 0:
            print(sign)
            sum += ((1 / (iter)) * sign)

        my_pi = 4 * (sum)
        fx = math.pi - my_pi
        iter += 1
        sign *= -1

    return my_pi
</code></pre>
<p>This results in an infinite loop. </p>
<p>I am supposed to use this series and find <code>my_pi</code> to a particular precision:</p>
<p><strong>Ï€/4 = (1/1) - (1/3) + (1/5) - (1/7) + (1/9) -  ...</strong></p>
<p>Pretty new to programming, any help would be amazing!</p>

<p>This part here</p>
<pre><code>if not iter % 2 == 0:
</code></pre>
<p>means you only sum when the iteration is not an even number, i.e., 1, 3, 5, ....
However, you alternate the sign every iteration, including that of the even iterations.</p>
<p>As a result, you get <code>1/1 + 1/3 + 1/5 + ...</code>.</p>
<p>Instead, try</p>
<pre><code>        if not iter % 2 == 0:
            print(sign)
            sum += ((1 / (iter)) * sign)
            sign *= -1 # move the sign assignment here
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GiorgosMyrianthous it's resulting in an infinite loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And what does <code>precision</code> represent?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you stepped through this line-by-line with a debugger, you'd likely find the issue very quickly. If you're still coding without knowing how to use a debugger, you're going to have a very hard time, since a debugger is an absolutely critical tool for software development. Pycharm has a debugger built-in - I'd recommend that for a beginner.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the tip @RandomDavis, will keep that in mind.</span>
