<p>My code:</p>

a=dit.multivariate.coinformation(d,'XY','Z')
print(a)
</code></pre>
<p>While running this program,the result i always get is "1.0".<br/>
The result come as negative or positive value like "-0.0023" or "0.120"</p>
<p>Basically,i want to do this

in Python.
A little bit of help will be highly appreciated</p>

<p>Tell me if this is the solution for you: <code>set_rv_names</code> to <code>d</code>:</p>
<pre><code>d=Xor()

## ADD THIS LINE OF CODE BELOW
d.set_rv_names(['X', 'Y', 'Z'])

X=0.052290766
Y=0.004951425
Z=0.000246642

a=dit.multivariate.coinformation(d,'XY','Z')
print(a)

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks alot for help. Are there like any other ways,i can do information theoretic approach problems with python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you can also build models from scratch, as long as you have a consistent knowledge of information theory. You can use it in decision trees, gradient boosting, neural networks, to customize loss and tree split. Did the answer solve your problem ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes,it did! Thanks again. But do you know about any package that can help in this information theoretic approach?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Glad to know, please give an upvote for the answer, I'll be thankful. I suggest you to study theory to better understand the concepts, and also approach deep learning, Informational GANs, how tree based methods for classification work. For instance, you can customize the loss of a deep learning model using information theory, KL divergence, entropy, surprise, mutual information. I don't know a specific library for that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try this: <code>X=[1,1,0]</code>,<code>Y=[0,0,1]</code>,<code>Z=[0,1,1]</code></span>
