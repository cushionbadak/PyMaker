<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have 9 different variables, we will call them a - i, I want to test if 
<code>a+b+c == d+e+f &amp; a+b+c == g+h+i &amp; a+b+c == a+d+g &amp; a+b+c == b+e+h &amp; a+b+c == c+f+i &amp; a+b+c == a+e+i &amp; a+b+c == c+e+g</code>. But there is one problem. I want to test all the possible arrangements of this such as swapping b and h or even more variables. I have also calculated that there are 45360 different arrangements. I am wondering if there is any possible way to do this... I would appreciate any help!</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itertools.permutations</a> to generate the list of all permutations, then you can either sum them, or write your own custom add function:</p>
<pre><code>def add3(n1, n2, n3):
    return n1+n2+n3

list_of_nums = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i]
all_perm_sums = (add3(n1, n2, n3) for n1, n2, n3 in itertools.permutations(list_of_nums, 3))
all_perm_sums_are_equal = len(set(all_perm_sums)) == 1
</code></pre>
<p>Hint: be careful with floating points, as floating point additions are not commutative, <code>a+b</code> is not necessarily equal to <code>b+a</code>, and they're not associative, <code>(a+b)+c</code> is not necessarily equal to <code>a+(b+c)</code>. This shouldn't be an issue if all the numbers are integers.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, put your objects into a <i>container</i> and use <code>itertools</code> or your own algorithm to get the combinatinos you need. Don't use a bunch of variables.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This doesn't exactly answer my question. I guess I worded it slightly wrong. If a=2, b=7, c=6, d=9, e=5, f=1, g=4, h=3, i=8, it should return true because <code>a+b+c == d+e+f &amp; a+b+c == g+h+i &amp; a+b+c == a+d+g &amp; a+b+c == b+e+h &amp; a+b+c == c+f+i &amp; a+b+c == a+e+i &amp; a+b+c == c+e+g</code>, even though <code>a+b+d == c+e+f &amp; a+b+d == g+h+i &amp; a+b+d == a+c+g &amp; a+b+d == b+e+h &amp; a+b+d == d+f+i &amp; a+b+d == a+e+i &amp; a+b+d == d+e+g</code> is not true. (On the second system of equations I only swapped c with d)</span>
