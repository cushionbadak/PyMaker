<p>I am making a program that will play a sound when you press a key (or just type) on the keyboard. </p>
<p>I just started to work on it, and I am trying to use <code>pygame.key.get_pressed()</code> to check for keyboard input. I got to here with the code:</p>
<pre><code>from pygame import init, key

init()

spam = []

while True:
    spam = key.get_pressed()
    if True in spam:
        print('KEY PRESSED')
    elif False in spam:
        print('NONE')
</code></pre>
<p>It works by checking if a <code>True</code> value is in <code>spam</code> (<code>spam</code> is the name of the list <code>pygame</code> returns). <code>key.get_pressed</code> returns a list of <code>True/False</code> values for every key, <code>True</code> if pressed, <code>False</code> if not.</p>
<p>The problem with this code is that when I run it, it only outputs <code>None</code>. This means that I am not detecting the keyboard input.</p>
<p>If anyone knows how to fix this, or a better way to do it, I would greatly appreciate it!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html#pygame.key.get_pressed" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pygame.key.get_pressed()</code></a> gets the states of all keybord buttons. It returns a list.<br/>
But, note the values which are returned by <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html#pygame.key.get_pressed" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pygame.key.get_pressed()</code></a> are only updated when the key event is get events from the queue by <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.get" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pygame.event.get()</code></a>. In simple words, <code>pygame.key.get_pressed()</code> only works, if there is an event loop, too.</p>
<p>You can evaluate a specific key (e.g. space key):</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>allKeys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
spam = allKeys[pygame.K_SPACE] 
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to evaluate if any key is pressed, then you've to evaluate if <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any()</code></a> value in <code>allKeys</code> is <code>True</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>allKeys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
anyKey = any([k for k in allKeys if k == True])
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Another solution would be to check if the <code>KEYDOWN</code> event occurred. The next pending event can be fetched by <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.get" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pygame.event.get()</code></a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>keyPressed = False
for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN: 
        keyPressed = True
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">If you don't mind, could you explain this part: <code>any([k for k in allKeys if k == True]) </code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JackH. Thats very basic python. <code>[  ]</code> generates a list. The elements of the list are all <code>k</code>, where <code>k</code>  is  <code>for k in allKeys</code>, if the condition <code>k == True</code> is fulfilled. So it is a list which contains all elements of <code>allKeys</code> which are have the value <code>True</code>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any()</code></a> returns <code>True</code>, if the list contains any element.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JackH. Is the answer acceptable? Are there remaining questions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, sorry i took a while. It does not work for some reason. I don't know why. If you know why, It would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</span>
