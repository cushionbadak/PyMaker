<p>I am trying to create a <code>player_def</code> function that will make creating a dictionary a little easier.</p>
<p>Looking at it now, this is probably kind of dumb because I can just do <code>players["betts"]["avg"]=340</code>, right? Anyway, to understand how Python works I would be grateful if any of you can explain why the following code is returning a key error instead of creating a nested dictionary.</p>
<pre><code>def player_def(x,y,z):
  players[x][y]=z
player_def("betts","avg",340)
print(players["betts"])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The easiest solution would be to use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">collections.defaultdict</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict

players = defaultdict(dict)

def player_def(x,y,z):
    players[x][y] = z

player_def("betts","avg",340)
print(players["betts"])
# {'avg': 340}
</code></pre>
<p>We define <code>players</code> as a <code>defaultdict</code> of <code>dict</code>. When we do:</p>
<pre><code>players["betts"]["avg"] = 340
</code></pre>
<p>if <code>players</code> doesn't yet have a <code>betts</code> key, a new one is created on the fly with an empty <code>dict</code> as value. So, we can add <code>"avg": 340</code> to this new dict.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do you mean this? I'm sorry, but my query does not respond to your problem in a comment, so I had to put it as a possible solution / explanation.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d={}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d['a'] = {'b' : {'c','d','e'} }
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'a': {'b': {'c', 'e', 'd'}}}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; d['a']['b']
{'c', 'e', 'd'}
</code></pre>
<p>///EDIT: So when the dictionary already exists, then you can change its contents. However, if you want to add a new pair (to the right side of an existing key), you must add to the existing key, a non-existent, just above syntax. I guess I explain that complicated, sorry.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d['a']['b'] = "4"
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'a': {'b': '4'}}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d['a']['b'] = ["4","test","hello"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'a': {'b': ['4', 'test', 'hello']}}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d['a']['b'] = (1,2,3,4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; d
{'a': {'b': (1, 2, 3, 4)}}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Another example from Python console:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; test = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; test['betts']['avg'] = 300
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
KeyError: 'betts'
&gt;&gt;&gt; test['betts'] = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; test['betts']['avg'] = 300
&gt;&gt;&gt; test
{'betts': {'avg': 300}}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">First, you have to specify that the <code>players</code> variable is a dictionary type. Only then can you add any items to the dictionary. This is done by direct declaration of the variable with <code>players = dict()</code> or by assigning an empty dictionary to the variable, i.e. <code>players = {}</code>. However, you are adding a dictionary pair <code>{a:b}</code> to a variable that does not exist yet. In addition, you want to use a nested dictionary (dictionary in the dictionary ...or... a two-dimensional data field). This makes the situation more complicated. Try using the Python Console to test the functionality.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ajeferson thank you. I did already have players defined as a dictionary earlier in the code. I only posted the part I considered relevant.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">All right, then show me how you have this variable declared. What exactly do you really want to explain? I do not understand, sorry.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GaryPalstor sorry about the wrong editing. Just redid it. Good luck!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@s3n0  I wrote  from player_dict_ import players and then players is defined with a big block of code that I do not know how to put in a comment here. :/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. I am new to Python. Can you explain what the defaultdict function is doing in this instance?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey I tried the  players["betts"]["avg"] = 340  and it returned a keyerror for "betts," apparently not creating a key within the dictionary "players."  Also, I am not sure how to format comments better so the code is in courier or whatever.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems that players["betts"]={"avg":340} works to define the variable but players["betts"]["avg"]=340 does not. Do you know why?  Sorry, not exactly a reply to your question, but I am using the logic you used in line 4 of that code.</span>
