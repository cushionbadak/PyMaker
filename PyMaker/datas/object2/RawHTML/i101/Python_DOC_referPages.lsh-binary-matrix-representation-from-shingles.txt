<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a large dataset of news articles, 48000 to be precise. I have made ngrams of each article where <code>n = 3</code>.
my ngrams look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[[(tikro, enters, into), (enter, into, research), (into, research, and),...]] 
</code></pre>
<p>now I need to make a binary matrix of each shingle and article:</p>
<pre><code>          article1 article2 article3
shingle1     1        0        0
shingle2     1        0        1
shingle3     0        1        0
</code></pre>
<p>At first I have kept all the shingles in a single list. After that, I have tried this to check if it works.</p>
<pre><code>for art in article:
    for sh in ngrams:
        if sh in art:
            print('found')
</code></pre>
<p>as one is set and another is string it does not work. any suggestions, how to make it work? or any other approach? </p>
<p>thank you</p>

<p>Before searching shingles in articles you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=join#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>join</code></a> to concatenate words of a shingle into a 3-word-phrase.</p>
<p>For example we have ngrams like:</p>
<pre><code>ngrams = [('tikro', 'enters', 'into'),
          ('enter', 'into', 'research'),
          ('into', 'research', 'and')]
</code></pre>
<p>Then we concatenate words into phrase for each shingle:</p>
<pre><code>shingles = [' '.join(x) for x in ngrams]
</code></pre>
<p>After the transformation the <code>shingles</code> is something like:</p>
<pre><code>['tikro enters into', 
 'enter into research', 
 'into research and']
</code></pre>
<p>which are strings you could search in your articles.</p>
