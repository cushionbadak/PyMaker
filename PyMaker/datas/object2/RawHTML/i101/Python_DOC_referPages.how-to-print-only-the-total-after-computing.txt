<p>I'm trying to write a code that would add the total of all the values from 0 to 100 and printing only the total after computing with any loop structure. </p>
<p>For another one I did it was short so I did this </p>
<pre><code>def listsum(numList):
    iSum = 0
    for i in numList:
        iSum = iSum + i
    return iSum

print(listsum([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]))
</code></pre>
<p>but 0 to 100 is too much ,, is there another way?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use a range: </p>
<pre><code>print(listsum(list(range(101))))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">range</a>:</p>
<pre><code>def listsum(numList):
    iSum = 0
    for i in range(1, numList+1):
        iSum += i
    return iSum
</code></pre>
<p>You would just pass the max value that you want the count up to (e.g. <code>print(listsum(100))</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The built-in sum() function gives the total value of all numbers in a list, so your listsum() function is not needed.</p>
<p><code>list(range(101))</code> gives you a list of all numbers from 1-100 (inclusive) </p>
<p>Putting those together you get</p>
<pre><code>print(sum(list(range(101))))
</code></pre>
<p>Which adds the total of all the values from 0 to 100 </p>
<p>The range function is much more powerful than this, <a href="https://www.pythoncentral.io/pythons-range-function-explained/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here's a good reference for using it</a> it's something you really need to know how to use well!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@JeffUK no, I mean exactly what it says - i.e. call the listsum function (defined by the poster) with a list composed of all integers from 0 to 100.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JeffUK. Indeed you could, but the question was about passing a list to the poster-defined listsum function.</span>
