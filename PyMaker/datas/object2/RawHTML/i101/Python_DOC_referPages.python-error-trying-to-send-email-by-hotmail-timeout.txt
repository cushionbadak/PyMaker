<p>I recommend reading the example in the manual located at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html</a></p>
<p>You would need to make sure your firewall operating system and LAN router allows outgoing traffic on port 25.</p>
<p>Also, set verbose debug level as per manual <code>server.set_debuglevel(1)</code></p>
<p>Try sending out test emails via localhost using terminal commands, to make sure the os can definitely send out emails, and that it isn't a python code issue.</p>
