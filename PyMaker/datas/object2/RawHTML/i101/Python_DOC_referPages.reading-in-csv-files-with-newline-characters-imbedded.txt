<p>I am currently reading in data from a csv file and inputting tokens and their definitions into a dictionary. The code works fine until it hits a place where the data in the CSV file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>"Token000\nip address\ntesttestest"
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my code so far:</p>
<pre><code>for line in f:
        if "Token" in line and re.search("Token\d", line):
            commaIndex = line.index(",", line.index("Token"))
            csvDict[line[line.index("Token"): commaIndex]] = line[commaIndex + 1: line.index(",", commaIndex + 1)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use this:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

data={}
with open('your_file.csv') as csv_file:
    reader=csv.reader(csv_file, skipinitialspace=True, quotechar="'")
    for row in reader:
        data[row[0]]=row[1:]

print(data)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#module-csv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#module-csv</a> should help. but it's hard to test if you don't provide a little more context of your csv input.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the reason for the problem is that you are reading the file line by line, and yet some values in your file also contain newline character (<code>\n</code>), as it is the case for the example you provided.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If the fields have new lines and no quotes around fields, how do you know when a row ends? what separator does it use for rows? It would be helpful to show a few lines of sample csv.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was thinking of using this but it reads the data the opposite way I have it set up. (reads vertically instead of horizontally or vice versa I can't remember). Is there a way to flip how it reads?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well I don't know if there is anything like that (AFAIK it's not). But I think that in standard csv, each line represents a record and I don't really understand why you would want to setup your file in another way</span>
