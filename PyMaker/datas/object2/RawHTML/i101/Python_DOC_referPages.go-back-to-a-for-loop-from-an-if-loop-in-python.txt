<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The function is supposed to load a list and print the sum of the first and last primes in the list. I have written it so that a new list is made and the idea i that only primes are appended to it - if its not a prime, it should go back to the beginning of that for loop.
I want my function to go back to the beginning of the for loop after </p>
<pre><code>if L[i] % j == 0:
</code></pre>
<p>as I only want prime numbers to be appended to y, but I don't think 'break' is the right thing to do here as I keep having my entire list being printed when I call the function. I've tried 'break', 'pass', 'continue' and an infinite loop (although I may not have done that correctly). Please help???</p>
<pre><code>def first_plus_last_prime(L):
    y = []
    for i in range(len(L)):

        if L[i] &lt; 2:
            break
        for j in range(2, L[i]):
            if L[i] % j == 0:
                break
        y.append(L[i])

    print(y)
    print(y[0])
    print(y[-1])
    t = y[0] + y[-1]
    return t
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the else statement:</p>
<pre><code>def first_plus_last_prime(L):
    y = []
    for i in range(len(L)):

        if L[i] &lt; 2:
            break

        # Look for prime
        for j in range(2, L[i]):
            if L[i] % j == 0:
                break
        else:
            y.append(L[i])

    print(y)
    print(y[0])
    print(y[-1])
    t = y[0] + y[-1]
    return t
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Just a suggestion: There is <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com">codereview.stackexchange.com</a>. After fixing your code, consider posting it there. Apart from the problem with the implementation itself, there are a bunch of other things that could be improved.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just answer your question about how to do in case that the number doesn't prime. But why you break the loop when you find a 0 or 1? If you do that you are not going to look the whole list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python allows <code>else</code> after a for-loop. Much more elegant and <i>exactly</i> invented for situations like this. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@UlrichEckhardt Thank you for the info, I edit the answer to show that way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks good now!</span>
