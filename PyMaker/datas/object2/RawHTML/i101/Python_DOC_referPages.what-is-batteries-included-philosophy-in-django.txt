<p>I recently read this sentence in Django documentation, but couldn't understand the meaning, please explain it in simple words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Django aims to follow Python's “batteries included” philosophy.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As documented <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#batteries-included" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in the official tutorial</a>, Python has a driving principle to include in the standard libraries all the quality tools you'll need to do nearly any job. Django, similarly, comes with modules to fit nearly any use case.</p>
<p>Contrast this with some other languages with much more minimal syntax and stdlib (Go comes to mind) which are much closer to "Batteries Not Included."</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"all the tools you need are included"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is not a programming question. This is an English idiom, not specific to programming or Django.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Mat <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic">On topic</a> includes as one of its first bullet points: "a practical, answerable problem that is unique to software development." That seems to be a concise description of this question. It's not a great one, but it's certainly on-topic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I googled that with django didn't get any cogent result. Probably my english is not good. thanks</span>
