<p>I have the following string :</p>
<pre><code>some_string = "%envvar1%\location\execution.exe"
</code></pre>
<p>envvar1 is an environment variable with value of "c:\", and I would like some function as following:</p>
<pre><code>some_string = "%envvar1%\location\execution.exe"
inject_env_variable(some_string)
print(some_string)
"c:\location\execution.exe"
</code></pre>
<p>Creating a function like this wouldnt be to difficult with regular expressions and os.environ but I was wondering if there was some kind of built in module that treats these kind of things.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> google searching anything with the word 'path' and 'python' is really tedious since all the searches are related to pythonpath :P</p>

<p><code>os.path.expandvars</code> is probably what you are looking for. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.expandvars" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.expandvars</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import os


def inject_env_variable(s):
   return s.replace("%envvar1%", os.environ['envvar1'])
</code></pre>
<p>Should do the trick</p>
