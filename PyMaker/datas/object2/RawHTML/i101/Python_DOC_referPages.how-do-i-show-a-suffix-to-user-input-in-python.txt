<p>I want a percentage sign to display after the users enters their number. Thanks</p>
<pre><code>percent_tip = float(input(" Please Enter the percent of the tip:")("%"))
</code></pre>
<p>For example, before the user types anything they should see:</p>
<pre><code>Please Enter the percent of the tip:
</code></pre>
<p>Once they begin typing the number <code>20</code> they should see:</p>
<pre><code>Please Enter the percent of the tip: 20
</code></pre>
<p>After they hit <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code> they should see:</p>
<pre><code>Please Enter the percent of the tip: 20%

<p>Please try this if this is what you are asking for:  </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are on Windows, you will have the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/msvcrt.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>msvcrt</code></a> module available. It provides, among others, the <code>getwche()</code> function, giving you the key pressed. This allows you to act on individual characters, and then print the % at the end (if you play around a bit more, you can probably also get it to appear while typing).</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>def get_chars(): 
     chars = []              
     new = msvcrt.getwche()     
     while new != '\r':  # returns \r on &lt;RETURN&gt; press
             # you probably want to do some input validation here
             chars.append(new)
             new = msvcrt.getwche()  # get the next one
     print(end='%', flush=True)
     return ''.join(chars)  # this returns a str, you might want to directly get an int
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you will probably want to add input validation inside to make sure the input is only numbers.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">After the number was entered? Just behind the number as it is being entered?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes after the number is entered. For example, if the number is 20 then I want 20% to display.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">After the final number has been entered? Or also while typing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">After the final number is entered</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But directly after the user-input number?</span>
