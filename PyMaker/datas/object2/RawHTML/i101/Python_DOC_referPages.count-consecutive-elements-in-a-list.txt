<p>I was doing a small program that count the number of times that a character appears in a list and I have a question, Â¿Is possible to do it by consecutive numbers?.
I have this code now:</p>
<pre><code>def function(list):
    final_list = []
    for element in set(list):
        final_list.append([element, list.count(element)])
    return final_list
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For a simpler solution, you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.groupby</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import groupby
l = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1]

[[k,len(list(v))] for k,v in groupby(l)]
# [[1, 3], [2, 2], [3, 1], [4, 2], [1, 3]]
</code></pre>
</div>
