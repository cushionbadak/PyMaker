<p>I used pickle for a few months to save my ML-models and was able to load them without any problems but recently after Reinstalling Windows and Python I am getting this error message when I try to load the exact same model:</p>
<p><code>AttributeError: type object 'sklearn.neighbors.ball_tree.NeighborsHeap' has no attribute '__reduce_cython__'</code></p>
<p>Does anyone know what is causing this?</p>
<p>I used Python 3.6 (64bit) before and I am using the same one right now.</p>

<p>Most probably, you are using a different version of <code>sklearn</code>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://github.com/cython/cython/search?q=__reduce_cython__" rel="nofollow noreferrer">search results for <code>__reduce_cython__</code> in Cython's codebase</a>, it's added by Cython to some compiled types to make <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html?highlight=__reduce__#object.__reduce__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__reduce__</code></a> work correctly or something. So its absense likely means changes in the affected classes or their hierarchy.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Same before and after, Python 3.6 (64 bit).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What are the versions of sklearn and requirements? Try installing an older sklearn?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is a possibility, is there a way to check version requirements of the model object?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Ivan, how can I fix this problem? Should I downgrade or upgrade? How do I find the required version?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tartaglia With <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickletools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/pickletools.html</a> , you can see the interpretation of pickled data. There might be something hinting on the version there. Otherwise, by trial and error. E.g. you have the file's date; with that, you may recall a rough time period when you installed the module -- look up which version was the latest at that time.</span>
