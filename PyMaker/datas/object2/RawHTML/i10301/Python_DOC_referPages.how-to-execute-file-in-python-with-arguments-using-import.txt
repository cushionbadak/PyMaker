<p>I read that you can execute a file using <code>import</code> like this<br/>
<strong>file.py</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
import file2
</code></pre>
<p><strong>file2.py</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
print "Hello World!"
</code></pre>
<p>And <strong>file.py</strong> will print <code>Hello World</code>. How would I execute this file with arguments, using <code>import</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Program arguments are available in <code>sys.argv</code> and can be used by any module. You could change file2.py to</p>
<pre><code>import sys
print "Here are my arguments", sys.argv
</code></pre>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow">argparse</a> module for more complex parsing.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Import is not meant for execution of scripts. It is used in order to fetch or "import" functions, classes and attributes it contains.</p>
<p>If you wish to execute the script using a different interpreter, and give it arguments, you should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#using-the-subprocess-module" rel="nofollow"><code>subprocess.run()</code></a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In Python 2 you may use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call" rel="nofollow"><code>subprocess.call()</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output" rel="nofollow"><code>subprocess.check_output()</code></a> if you need the programs output.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">He doesn't want the arguments to be received from terminal. He wants to send them through the "import" statement.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bharel OP never stated where the arguments come from or how they are consumed in <i>file2.py</i>. He certainly did not say they were not standard program arguments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tdelaney I'm sorry, apparently my instructions weren't clear enough. But I want to <b>execute</b> a file using import, if possible.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bjskistad - what do you mean by "execute"? Importing causes the module to be executed. Its <code>__name__</code> is <code>file2</code> instead of <code>__main__</code> but otherwise it is pretty much the same as executing it directly from the command line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perhaps you could add a few lines to <i>file2.py</i> to show how you want to use the arguments and add some detail about where these arguments come from - is it from the command line? Is <i>file1.py</i> generating them?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes and no. If you install a package, modules aren't in the system <code>PATH</code> and its common to include helper scripts in the <code>PATH</code> to run them. Also, this import technique lets you fiddle with the system environment before the target script is run.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm using 2.7, is there any way to do this in 2.7? Or do I need to upgrade to 3.x?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bjskistad added for Python 2.</span>
