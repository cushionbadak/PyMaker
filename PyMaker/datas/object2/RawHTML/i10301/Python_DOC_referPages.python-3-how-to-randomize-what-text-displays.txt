<p>I am a beginner at python and I am trying to figure out how I can randomly display text. For example, 60% chance of "Hello", 40% chance of saying "Goodbye", etc. Right now, for fun, I am trying to create sort of a bottle flip game. If you don't know what it is, its basically when you flip a half empty water bottle and try to land it. This is what I have: (This is more than likely completely wrong.)</p>
<pre><code>import random

number = random.randrange(10)

if number == "1":
    print ("You have landed the bottle!")
elif number == "2":
    print ("You have landed the bottle!")
elif number == "3":
    print ("You have landed the bottle!")
elif number == "4":
    print ("You have landed the bottle!")
elif number == "5":
    print ("The bottle did not land, better luck next time.")
elif number == "6":
    print ("The bottle did not land, better luck next time.")
elif number == "7":
    print ("The bottle did not land, better luck next time.")
elif number == "8":
    print ("The bottle did not land, better luck next time.")
elif number == "9":
    print ("The bottle did not land, better luck next time.")
elif number == "10":
    print ("The bottle landed on the cap!")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have the right idea, basically, but you can greatly simplify your code.</p>
<pre><code>if number &lt; 5:
    print ("You have landed the bottle!")
elif number &lt; 10:
    print ("The bottle did not land, better luck next time.")
else:
    print ("The bottle landed on the cap!")
</code></pre>
<p>You can change the values in your call to <code>randrange</code> and in the if statements above to get just about any weighting you'd like.</p>
<p>Note that in your original question you were comparing numbers to strings. I changed that here. Comparing numbers to strings (i.e. <code>3 == "3"</code>) will always be <code>False</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could also use a list of the possible solutions.</p>
<pre><code>import random
possibilities=['landed'] * 3 + ['missed'] * 6 + ['landed on cap'] 
print(random.choice(possibilities))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Tip 1: use code formatting instead of quotes, please <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/39713257/edit">edit</a> your question. Tip 2: what is the question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random</a> module</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You may want to know that <code>random.randrange(10)</code> returns a <i>number</i>, but you are comparing against <i>strings</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>numpy.random.choice</code></a> accepts weights of the choices with the <code>p</code> kwarg.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should probably note that comparing strings and integers is wrong which is a problem :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndrewL. Thanks, I added a note pointing that out.</span>
