<p>I tried the following code to read in the database</p>
<pre><code>import json

f = r'&lt;file_path&gt;\recipeitems-latest.json'

with open(f) as dfile:
    data = json.load(dfile)

print(data)
</code></pre>
<p>With this I received the following Traceback</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/&lt;redacted&gt;/Documents/&lt;redacted&gt;/project/test_json.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
    data = json.load(dfile)
  File "C:\Users\&lt;redacted&gt;\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda3\Lib\json\__init__.py", line 265, in load
    return loads(fp.read(),
  File "C:\Users\&lt;redacted&gt;\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda3\Lib\encodings\cp1252.py", line 23, in decode
    return codecs.charmap_decode(input,self.errors,decoding_table)[0]
UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x9d in position 101915: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The only way I could find around this error was to only have one entry in the json file.  Is the db formatted incorrectly or am I reading in the data wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The file is not a <code>json</code> array. <em>Each line of the file</em> is a <code>json</code> document, but the whole file is not in <code>json</code> format.</p>
<p>Read the file by lines, and use <code>json.loads</code>:</p>
<pre><code>with open('some_file') as f:
  for line in f:
     doc = json.loads(line)
</code></pre>
<p>You may also need to pass the <code>encoding</code> parameter to <code>open()</code>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow">See here</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">if you're parsing the file as a whole, that will fail. it's not valid json. it's a bunch of individual SEPARATE valid json lines, but you can't parse them all at once. if you read line-by-line, and parsed the lines that should work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Got it. Thanks Marc</span>
