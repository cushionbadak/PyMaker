<p>The code below works fine, however the message prints onto separate lines once it has been encrypted. For example if I type: abc with the shift of 1 it encrypts it but prints it back as:</p>
<pre><code>b
c
d
</code></pre>
<p>And I don't understand why. I want it to print as:</p>
<pre><code> bcd 
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>print("Welcome to the Code-Breaking/Making Software")
print("This program uses something called a Caesar Cipher.")

Message = (input("Please enter the message you wish to Encrypt &gt;&gt; "))
Shift = int(input("Please enter the shift for your message &gt;&gt; "))

for x in Message:
    OrdMessage = ord(x) 
    ShiftedMessage = OrdMessage + Shift
    NewMessage = chr(ShiftedMessage)
    NewMessageList = list(NewMessage)
    print("".join(NewMessageList))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Indentation matters and you shouldn't create new list of <code>NewMessage</code> everytime  </p>
<pre><code>print("Welcome to the Code-Breaking/Making Software")
print("This program uses something called a Caesar Cipher.")

Message = (input("Please enter the message you wish to Encrypt &gt;&gt; "))
Shift = int(input("Please enter the shift for your message &gt;&gt; "))

NewMessageList = []
for x in Message:
    OrdMessage = ord(x) 
    ShiftedMessage = OrdMessage + Shift
    NewMessage = chr(ShiftedMessage)
    NewMessageList.append(NewMessage)
print("".join(NewMessageList))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you should change the following part;</p>
<pre><code>print("".join(NewMessageList), end="")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What happening was is that for each charachter it was running the loop and printing the answer, now I have collected all the encrypted letter and clubbed them as one in the end and printed it.</p>
<p>it at first initialize an empty list with <code>NewMessage = []</code> and then for every letter that we get encrypted it adds to that empty list using <code>.append()</code> and at end print all by <code>''.join(NewMessage)</code></p>
<pre><code>print("Welcome to the Code-Breaking/Making Software")
print("This program uses something called a Caesar Cipher.")

Message = (input("Please enter the message you wish to Encrypt &gt;&gt; "))
Shift = int(input("Please enter the shift for your message &gt;&gt; "))

NewMessage = []
for x in Message:
    OrdMessage = ord(x) 
    ShiftedMessage = OrdMessage + Shift
    NewMessage.append(chr(ShiftedMessage)) 
print(''.join(NewMessage))

<span class="comment-copy">you are printing each char within your for loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How would I fix that then? By adding the print outside of the for loop?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That works thanks! Can you maybe explain the commands you used as I am not familiar. (College Student)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Only command used here is <code>append</code>. What it does it appends element to list. Read more in documentation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What about NewMessageList = [] Does that just assign the variable to nothing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">not nothing. [] is empty list, () is empty tuple, {} is empty dictonary, set() is empty set, list() is empty list and so on...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I still don't get what append actually does.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What does NewMessage = [] do and .append?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it at first initialize an empty list with <code>NewMessage = []</code> and then for every letter that we get encrypted it adds to that empty list using <code>.append()</code> and at end print all by <code>''.join(NewMessage)</code></span>
