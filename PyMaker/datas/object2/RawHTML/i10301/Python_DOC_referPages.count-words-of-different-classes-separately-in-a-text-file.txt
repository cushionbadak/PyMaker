<p>I have some text files in Persian. each file contains a lot of sentences, each in a new line. And in front of each sentence there is a tab, then a word, then a tab and then an English word. These English words in some files are 2, in some are 3, in some are 5 and in some other, are more or less. Actually, they show the sentences classes. I have to count each class's total words separately (just count the words of sentences not the words after them). For that I have to change the file to a list, so that I can achieve the sentences. Now the problem is that, how should I write the code that it returns each class's total words separately. Below is the sample sentences. </p>

<pre><code>corpus = []
def CountWords (file):
    with open (file, encoding = "utf-8") as f1:
         for line in f1:
             t = line.strip().split("\t")
             corpus.append(t)
             for row in corpus:
                 if row[2] != row[2]:
</code></pre>
<p>Now I don't know how to continue. I appreciate a lot if someone can help. (I have no background in programming).</p>

<p>If I get you correctly then the next code might work. Please note, that I use Python 3.x.</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

counter = Counter()

with open(filename, encoding='utf-8') as f:
     for line in f:
         *persian_words, word_class = line.strip().split()
         counter[word_class] += len(persian_words) - 1

# Print the top 10 word classes with respective number of Persian words
for word_class, count in counter.most_common(10):
    print('{}\t{}'.format(word_class, count))
</code></pre>

<p>Try to formulate your algorithm on paper then convert it to Python: I'm sure you'll find your solution by yourself.</p>

<p>An advice: </p>
<ul>
<li>You can use ˋcsv` module to read your file. Look for some tutorial with this keyword.</li>
<li>You can use ˋcollection.Counter` to count the number of occurrences of words. This can be useful. </li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm not quite clear what problem you are facing, but you can use awesome <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> data structure to count elements in your files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by class's words? An example ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">for example, how many words are in "passion" class, how many words are in "salty" class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot. It is what I wanted. But unfortunately, it doesn't return the right number of total words!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@suneye, what's the exact problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@suneye, are you able to give us more information? I check my code (the second version using <code>csv</code> module) and it works flawlessly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try to upload it on <a href="http://pastebin.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pastebin.com</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@suneye, I see that you've uploaded an image to your question, but that doesn't help me. I need to get your plain text file.</span>
