<p>Is there any way to execute python with pyside on a computer that has only python installed?</p>
<p>I need to distribute a simple tool on a lot of computers and we can't install pyside everywhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>PySide is a set of bindings for Qt, which is a library written in C++. And it is not part of the Python core.</p>
<p>If you want a GUI that is portable and that can be used with a default Python installation, consider <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html" rel="nofollow"><code>tkinter</code></a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi, You may find this package useful: <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cx_Freeze" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pypi.python.org/pypi/cx_Freeze</a> . You can take a look here too: . <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18397994/what-is-the-best-approach-with-compiling-pyside-application" title="what is the best approach with compiling pyside application">stackoverflow.com/questions/18397994/â€¦</a> . Hope this helps.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there any portable pyside libraries? You need to have PySide installed also, but I can't do that either.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!  Even if it's not part of python core, aren't there any portable libraries?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think that tkinter is good solution in this case. Please take a look here for further infos <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/gui/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/gui</a> . Good luck</span>
