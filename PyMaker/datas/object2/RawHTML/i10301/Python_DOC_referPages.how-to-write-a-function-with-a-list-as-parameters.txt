<p>Here is the question, I'm  trying to deÔ¨Åne a function <code>sample_mean</code> that takes in a list of numbers as a parameter and returns the sample mean of the the numbers in that list. Here is what I have so far, but I'm not sure it is totally right. </p>
<pre><code>def sample_mean(list):
    """ (list) -&gt; number
     takes in a list of numbers as a parameter and returns the sample mean of the the numbers in that list
     sample_mean =
     sample_mean =
    """

    mean = 0
    values = [list]
    for list in values:
        print('The sample mean of', values, 'is', mean(list))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Firstly, don't use <code>list</code> as a name because it shadows/hides the builtin <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list" rel="nofollow"><code>list</code></a> class for the scope in which it is declared. Use a name that describes the values in the list, in this case <code>samples</code> might be a good name. The function could be implemented with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>def sample_mean(samples):
    total = 0
    for value in samples:
        total = total + value
    return total / float(len(samples))
</code></pre>
<p>Or a shorter version which avoids writing your own loop by making use of Python's <code>sum()</code> function :</p>
<pre><code>def sample_mean(samples):
    return sum(samples) / float(len(samples))
</code></pre>
<p>Call the function like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sample_mean([1,2,3,4,5]))
3.0
</code></pre>
<p>Note the use of <code>float()</code> to ensure that the division operation does not lose the fractional part. This is only an issue in Python 2 which uses integer division by default. Alternatively you could add this to the top of your script:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import division
</code></pre>
<p>If you are sure that you only need to support Python 3 you can remove the <code>float()</code> and ignore the above.</p>

<p>As stated above by @idjaw, don't use <code>list</code> as a parameter instead use <code>listr</code> (for example). Your <code>values = [list]</code> is erroneous (also stated by @idjaw) and should be removed.</p>
<p>Also, according to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/" rel="nofollow">PEP257</a>, you should not use <code>"(list) -&gt; number"</code> in your docstrings as that should only be used for builtins.</p>
<p>Finally, your loop should look like <code>for l in listr:</code> and then you add values to your mean variable. divide it by the number of values in the list and print the result.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Don't use <code>list</code> as an argument to define your <i>list</i>. It shadows the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If your method takes a list, then <code>values = [list]</code> doesn't make sense. The argument you are passing to your list should already be a list, so what you are doing there is not needed. E.g: if you have a list being passed to your method as <code>[1, 2]</code>,  then <code>values = [list]</code> will turn that to <code>[[1, 2]]</code>. Which is definitely what you don't want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Awesome thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you this is very helpful information. I am all new to coding and python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have a question regarding the answer to print a statement like this       "The sample mean of [samples] is [sample_mean]"                   I have this but it wont print the statement like I want it to, samples = 0, for num in samples: print('The sample mean of' , samples, 'is', sample_mean) can someone explain what is wrong?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is <code>sample_mean</code> an <code>int</code>? then why would you have <code>for num in samples:</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no sample_mean is the mean of the samples</span>
<span class="comment-copy">then remove the for loop.</span>
