<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I use the following to see if the data is an integer, if not it tells me. Is there a way to determine which one is incorrect so can change it or would i have to create the same loop for every item?</p>
<pre><code>while i_input == True:
    try:
        i_pointstarget=int(pointstarget.get())
        i_ap1=int(ap1.get())
        i_ap2=int(ap2.get())
        i_ap3=int(ap3.get())
        i_ap4=int(ap4.get())
        i_ap5=int(ap5.get())
        i_ap6=int(ap6.get())
    except ValueError:
        i_input=False
        continue
    else:
        break
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks for any help :)</p>

<p>Instead of trying to convert to <code>int</code> (btw <code>int(1.23)</code> works, returning <code>1</code>) you can also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/numbers.html" rel="nofollow">numbers</a> like</p>
<pre><code>import numbers
def is_integral(n): # actually not checking for int but also other int-equivalents
    return isinstance(n,numbers.Integral)
</code></pre>
<p>if you want to check if you have a number which can loslessy be converted to an integral number (like <code>int</code>) you can do</p>
<pre><code>import numbers
def exact_integral(n): # check if n can be exactly represented as an integer
    return isinstance(n,numbers.Complex) and n==round(n.real)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To know the type of a variable you can use <code>isinstance(variable_name, int)</code>, this will return the Boolean value.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">... Have you considered writing a separate function to convert?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IgnacioVazquez-Abrams I don't need to convert it i just need to locate which one is wrong</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you don't need to convert it then how come you keep calling <code>int()</code> each time?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IgnacioVazquez-Abrams Because I want the variable to be a int, i was using this to then detect if it's not an int however it doesn't tell you which one isn't an int. At least I think that's what it is doing - i'm new and not very good :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Add some sample input and out.</span>
