<p>I'm trying to multiply numbers greater than 3 by two, and subtract one from everything else. However, nothing happens to the list.
This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

print (lst)

[x*2 if x &gt; 3 else x-1 for x in lst]     

print (lst)
</code></pre>
<p>Why aren't the contents of the <em>lst</em> variable modified by the list comprehension?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You didnt re-assigned it to the variable name.</p>
<pre><code>lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

print (lst)

lst = [x*2 if x &gt; 3 else x-1 for x in lst]

print (lst)
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>List Comprehensions and Assignment</h2>
<p>You're missing an assignment. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">List comprehensions</a> like yours don't do in-place modifications to the list elements. Instead, the expression returns a new list, so you must <em>assign</em> the result of the list comprehension expression back to a variable. For example:</p>
<pre><code>list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
list = [x*2 if x &gt; 3 else x-1 for x in list]
print(list)
</code></pre>
<p>In Ruby, there are certainly methods for performing self-mutating operations, but I'm not personally aware of a Python equivalent that retains the semantics that you're trying to use here.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>[x*2 if x &gt; 3 else x-1 for x in lst]</code> is just an expression, it will return a value but you haven't assign this value to a variable yet.</span>
