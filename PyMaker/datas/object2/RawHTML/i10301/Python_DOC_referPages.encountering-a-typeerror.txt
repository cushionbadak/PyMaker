<p>This is my original code, which runs fine on Python:</p>
<pre><code>from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

print "We're going to erase %r." % filename
print "If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C)."
print "If you do want that, hit RETURN."

raw_input("?")

print "Opening the file..."
target = open(filename, 'w')

print "Truncating the file.     Goodbye!"
target.truncate()

print "Now I'm going to ask you for three lines."

line1 = raw_input("line 1: ")
line2 = raw_input("line 2: ")
line3 = raw_input("line 3: ")

print "I'm going to write these to the file."

target.write("%s \n%s \n%s \n") % (line1, line2, line3)

print "And finally, we close it."
target.close()
</code></pre>
<p>I then attempted to clean up the repetition:</p>
<pre><code>from sys import argv

script, filename = argv

print "We're going to erase %r." % filename
print "If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C)."
print "If you do want that, hit RETURN."

raw_input("?")

print "Opening the file..."
target = open(filename, 'w')

print "Truncating the file.     Goodbye!"
target.truncate()

print "Now I'm going to ask you for three lines."

line1 = raw_input("line 1: ")
line2 = raw_input("line 2: ")
line3 = raw_input("line 3: ")

print "I'm going to write these to the file."

target.write("%s \n%s \n%s \n") % (line1, line2, line3)

print "And finally, we close it."
target.close()
</code></pre>
<p>For some reason the new code does not completely run, it gets to line 27 and then returns </p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %: 'NoneType' and 'str'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any idea on how I can correct this issue?</p>
<p>I am very new to coding in general and I am learning to code in Python 2.6, using Zed Shaw's "Learning Code the Hard Way", so any help with this would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>It looks like your line <code>target.write("%s \n%s \n%s \n") % (line1, line2, line3)</code> is the problem. </p>
<p>You've closed off the <code>write</code> function call before doing the variable substitutions. So the variables line1, line2, and line3 are not being inserted into the %s's. Therefore you've got a bunch of <code>None</code>'s getting written instead which is causing the error.</p>
<p>Change it to look like this:</p>
<pre><code>target.write("%s \n%s \n%s \n" % (line1, line2, line3))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>%</code> is a string operator; you are trying to use it with the return value of <code>target.write()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>target.write("%s \n%s \n%s \n" % (line1, line2, line3))
</code></pre>
<p>If you are just starting, I encourage you to switch to Python 3.5 and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>str.format</code></a> syntax. This way, you won't have problems with the premature closure of parentheses:</p>
<pre><code>target.write("{0} \n{1} \n{2} \n".format(line1, line2, line3))
</code></pre>
<p>Version 3.6 is currently in development and starting beta testing, and it will have a much more natural syntax for building this kind of string called <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/" rel="nofollow">f strings</a>:</p>
<pre><code>target.write(f'{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}\n')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Typo? You closed off the <code>write()</code> method.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Peter. Your last line is a bit concerning. You are just starting to learn Python, why are you using 2.6?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, the "first" and "second" code look to be the exact same...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you are new to Python, why are you starting with Python 2? The <a href="http://sopython.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Stack Overflow Python community</a> overwhelmingly <a href="http://sopython.com/wiki/What_tutorial_should_I_read%3F" rel="nofollow noreferrer">recommends</a> starting with Python 3, as does <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python.org itself</a>. Version 3 is the present and future of the language, while 2 is the past. In learning 2 first, you'll pick up many bad habits that will need to be corrected when you learn 3 (which you'll need to do eventually), so it's much better to start with 3 first, then learn the differences in 2 later.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>Learn Python the Hard Way</i> is <a href="http://sopython.com/wiki/LPTHW_Complaints" rel="nofollow noreferrer">just awful</a>. We <b><i>strongly</i></b> recommend using a different tutorial, and using Python 3, as I indicated above.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! This was helpful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure you want to recommend f strings? 3.6 only just released beta 1, so it's definitely not production-ready yet. I would suggest 3.5 and using the <code>.format()</code> syntax...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My bad; I didn't realize 3.6 was only a beta release yet.</span>
