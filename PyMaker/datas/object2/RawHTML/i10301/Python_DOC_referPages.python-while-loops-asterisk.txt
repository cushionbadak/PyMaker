<p>Re-type and run, note incorrect behavior. Then fix errors in the code, which should print num_stars asterisks.</p>
<pre><code>while num_printed != num_stars:
    print('*')
</code></pre>
<p>Below is the code which I have entered. I am getting an infinite loop hence no answer. Please help me out! Thanks!</p>
<pre><code>num_stars = 3

num_printed = 0

while(num_printed != num_stars):

    print(num_stars*'*')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You'll want either:</p>
<pre><code>num_stars = 3
print(num_stars * '*')
</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre><code>num_stars = 3
num_printed = 0
while(num_printed &lt; num_stars):
    print('*')
    num_printed += 1
</code></pre>
<p>Depending on what you're trying to do.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You're never incrementing num_printed. Also, don't check <code>!=</code>, check <code>&gt;</code> for greater check safety.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print(num_stars*'*')</code> prints num_stars asterisks. There is no need for the <code>while</code> loop.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Sean Pianka: is this what you meant?   num_stars = 3 num_printed = 0  while(num_printed &gt; num_stars):     print(num_stars * '*') Program isnt producing an output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">zvone: I have to use a while loop because 3 is not the only value of num_stars which is being checked.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It may be worth to emphasize that these two code snippets are not equivalent.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! it was the second one which I needed!</span>
