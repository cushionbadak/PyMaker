<p>I'm using Notepad ++ to do a find and replacement function. Currently I have a a huge numbers of text files. I need to do a replacement for different string in different file. I want do it in batch. For example.</p>
<p>I have a folder that has the huge number of text file. I have another text file that has the strings for find and replace in order</p>
<p>Text1 Text1-corrected</p>
<p>Text2 Text2-corrected</p>
<p>I have a small script that do this replacement only for the opened files in Notepad++. For achieving this I'm using <strong>python script</strong> in <strong>Notepad++</strong>. The code is as follows.</p>
<pre><code> with open('C:/replace.txt') as f:
 for l in f:
    s = l.split()
    editor.replace(s[0], s[1]) 
</code></pre>
<p>In simple words, the find and replace function should fetch the input from a file.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>with open('replace.txt') as f:
    replacements = [tuple(line.split()) for line in f]
for filename in filenames:
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        contents = f.read()
        for old, new in replacements:
            contents = contents.replace(old, new)
        f.write(contents)
</code></pre>
<p>Read replacements into a list of tuples, then go through each file, and read the contents into memory, do the replacements, then write it back.  I think the files get overwritten properly, but you might want to double check.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the response Patrick. Where to set the source folder path? It is not mentioned in the code. Kindly help me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The python script is "in" whatever place you run it from.  To change the directory it's in, use the <code>chdir</code> function from the <code>os</code> module: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#process-parameters" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#process-parameters</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The code is not working. I have set the working folder and tried the code. It was not working. The error code it shows is ` for filename in filenames: NameError: name 'filenames' is not defined`</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PradeepAugustine make a list <code>filenames</code> that contains the names of the files you want to modify.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want all the files in its root and its sub-folder to get modified. The Final code I used is <code>import os os.chdir('c:\\Users\Prade\Desktop\Bible Format\Bible') with open('replace.txt') as f:     replacements = [tuple(line.split()) for line in f] for filename in files:     with open(filename, 'w') as f:         contents = f.read()         for old, new in replacements:             contents = contents.replace(old, new)         f.write(contents)</code> The same error.</span>
