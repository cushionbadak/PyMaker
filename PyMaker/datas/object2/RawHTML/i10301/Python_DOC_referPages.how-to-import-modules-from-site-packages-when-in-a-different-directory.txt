<p>I made a module and moved it to <code>/root/Downloads/Python-3.5.2/Lib/site-packages</code>.</p>
<p>When I run bash command <code>python3</code> in this folder to start the ide and import the module it works. However if I run <code>python3</code> in any other directory (e.g. <code>/root/Documents/Python</code>) it says</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>ImportError: No module named 'exampleModule'
</code></pre>
<p>I was under the impression that Python would automatically search for modules in <code>site-packages</code> regardless of the directory. How can I fix it so that it will work regardless of where I am?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of moving the module I would suggest you add the location of the module to the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable.  If this is set then the python interpreter will know where to look for your module.</p>
<p>e.g. on Linux</p>
<pre class="lang-sh prettyprint-override"><code>export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:&lt;insert module location here&gt;
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Paths <code>/root/Documents/Python</code> and <code>/root/Downloads/Python-3.5.2/</code> are not the same.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know they're not the same. My point is that from what I understand when you import a module in Python it will automatically search site-packages for the module, regardless of whether you're in that directory or not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then you're under the wrong impression. You need to add the path to your module to a <code>.pth</code> file (new or existing) that is in the <code>/root/Downloads/Python-3.5.2/Lib/site-packages</code> directory. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#module-site" rel="nofollow noreferrer">site module's documention</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@J.Doe That's <i>a</i> <code>site-packages</code> directory, but it is not one that appears in your Python path (except when it is found via the current working directory).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This will give you a list of the directories searched by default, it is created when python is installed:  <code>import sys; print(sys.path)</code></span>
