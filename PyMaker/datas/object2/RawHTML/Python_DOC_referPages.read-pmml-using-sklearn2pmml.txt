<p>If you want to save a fitted Scikit-Learn pipeline so that it could be loaded back into Scikit-Learn/Python, then you need to use "native" Python serialization libraries and dataformats such as Pickle.</p>
<p>The conversion from Scikit-Learn to PMML should be regarded one-way operation. There is no easy way of getting PMML back into Scikit-Learn.</p>
<p>You can always save the fitted Scikit-Learn pipeline in multiple data formats. Save one copy in Pickle data format so that it could be loaded back into Scikit-Learn/Python, and save another copy in PMML data format so that it would be loaded in non-Python environments.</p>
