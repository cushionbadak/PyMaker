<p>I'm trying to obtain the information about the applications launched by the user in a Windows device. My idea is to obtain the same information that the Task Manager shows abount Apps, like RAM, CPU and Disk usage.
However, I can only find libraries that provide information about all the running processes, such as <em>tasklist</em>, <em>wmi</em> or <em>psutil</em>, and not only about the applications launched by the user. I also tried any way to differentiate background proceses from user applications, but I found nothing.</p>
<p>Is there any way to obtain the information above mentioned only about user applications?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I am not an expert in these things, but perhaps you would be interested in <code>win32com</code>, <code>win32gui</code>, or <code>win32api</code> and perhaps others. As I know these are very low level modules that allow you to interact with stuff like that. Here is a short script I made to force a certain window to remain on top of my screen even if I click on another window:</p>
<pre><code>import win32gui
import win32con

hwnd = win32gui.FindWindow(None, 'Snipping Tool')
print(hwnd)
win32gui.SetWindowPos(hwnd, win32con.HWND_TOPMOST, 200, 200, 425, 325, 0)
</code></pre>
