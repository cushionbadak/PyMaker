<p>I have a Python code that I want to profile with <code>nvprof</code> or <code>visual profiler</code>,
I want to know how many threads are used on my code?</p>
<p>I need Linux command.</p>
<p>Using this command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo dmidecode -t 4 | egrep -i "Designation|Intel|core|thread"
</code></pre>
<p>Gets me this information, but it's not for my code:  </p>
<pre><code>Socket Designation: CPU1
Manufacturer: Intel
        HTT (Multi-threading)
Version: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2697 v3 @ 2.60GHz

Thread Count: 28
        Multi-Core
        Hardware Thread

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.active_count" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>threading.active_count</code></a>. From the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the number of <code>Thread</code> objects currently alive. The returned count is equal to the length of the list returned by <code>enumerate()</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the documentation of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>threading.enumerate</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return a list of all <code>Thread</code> objects currently alive. The list includes daemonic threads, dummy thread objects created by <code>current_thread()</code>, and the main thread. It excludes terminated threads and threads that have not yet been started.</p>
