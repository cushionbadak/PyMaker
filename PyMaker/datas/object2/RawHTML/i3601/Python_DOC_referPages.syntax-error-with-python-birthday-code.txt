<p>I am trying to learn to use this simple birthday one-liner in Python (3.6.5) but am getting SyntaxError: invalid syntax, can someone help me figure out where I've gone wrong:</p>
<pre><code>print map(lambda x: "Happy Birthday to " + ("you" if x != 2 else "dear Name"),range(4))
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You've tagged this as python 3.x. This is python 2.x code. You need</p>
<pre><code>print(list(map(lambda x: "Happy Birthday to " + ("you" if x != 2 else "dear Name"),
               range(4))))
</code></pre>
<p>since <code>print</code> is a function, not a statement in python 3. Also <code>map</code> returned a <code>list</code> in python 2 but <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow noreferrer">now</a> returns an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32583304/difference-between-map-and-list-iterators-in-python3">iterator</a> which needs to be wrapped in <code>list</code> in order to print the values.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This is also slightly old-style python, a modern way of writing this would be</p>
<pre><code>print(["happy birthday to {}".format('you' if x != 2 else 'dear name') for x in range(4)]) 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The reason why your code fails on python 3.x as already been answered by @FHTMitchell answer, that said, here's a simpler way to achieve what you want in both python2.x/3.x:</p>
<pre><code>print(["Happy Birthday to {}".format("you" if x!=2 else "dear Name") for x in range(4)])
</code></pre>
<p>There is a lot of ways to achieve this task, few more examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>lst = ["Happy Birthday to you"]*4; lst[1] = lst[1].replace("you", "dear Name"); print(lst)</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>s1 = "Happy Birthday to you"; print([s1,s1.replace("you", "dear Name"),s1,s1])</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>But if you ask me, my favourite one, even if not a oneliner, would be doing something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import textwrap

song = textwrap.dedent("""\
    Happy Birthday to you
    Happy Birthday to dear Name
    Happy Birthday to you
    Happy Birthday to you
""")

print(song.splitlines())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><em>Since we're playing lets find different ways to skin a cat.</em></p>
<pre><code>placeholders = ['to you'] * 4
placeholders[2] = 'dear name'  # placeholders.insert(2, 'dear name')
print([f'Happy birth {placeholder}' for placeholder in placeholders])
</code></pre>
<p>ps. I don't like lambdas, they're slow. </p>
<hr/>
<p>On another note, thanks @FHTMitchell, I've always known <code>list.insert()</code> was slow but i had no idea it was SOO slow.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import timeit
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit('a += ["something"]', setup='a = ["thing"]')
0.07153259999904549
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit('a[0] = "something"', setup='a = ["thing"]')
0.03036419999989448
&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.timeit('a.insert(0, "something")', setup='a = ["thing"]')

<p>Holy smokes!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">if it's python3, add brackets to <code>print()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OmarEinea and wrap in <code>list</code> since <code>map</code> is an iterator in 3.x</span>
<span class="comment-copy">beat you to it ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">posted at the same time than you, meh... giving you +1 for being that fast ;D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Na the best one liner would be: <code>print([f'Happy birth to {placeholder}' for placeholder in ['you', 'you', 'dear name', 'you']])</code> its actually one line :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not an expert on English songs... but wouldn't be Happy birthday instead Happy birth? :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Birthday_to_You#Lyrics" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The song</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you don't like lambda because it's slow, definitely don't use <code>list.insert</code>!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FHTMitchell LOL. You're correct.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your code won't be python2.x compatible... and the song says happy birthday, ie: <a href="http://www.1happybirthday.com/traditional_birthday_lyrics.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.1happybirthday.com/traditional_birthday_lyrics.php</a> :'D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BPL OP said 3.6.5 -- thats what I use, as far as im concerned, python without f-strings is beneath me, and i refuse to acknowledge its existence. Python was born at 3.6 :P   edit: i fixed the song !!! :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Javier Buzzi Haha, fair enough, I hadn't seen the python3-x tag ;) , +1</span>
