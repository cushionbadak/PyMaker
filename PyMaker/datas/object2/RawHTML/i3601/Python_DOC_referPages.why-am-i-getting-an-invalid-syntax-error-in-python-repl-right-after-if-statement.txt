<p>I think this is perfectly valid.</p>
<pre><code>if False:
    print(1)
print(2)

<p>However, it gives me an invalid syntax error in Python REPL.</p>
<p>Why is it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, take a look at this if statement:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; the_world_is_flat = True
&gt;&gt;&gt; if the_world_is_flat:
...     print("Be careful not to fall off!")
...
Be careful not to fall off!
</code></pre>
<p>The continuation lines determine where the block starts and ends. So if there is a continuation line, it means it is part of the block. In your case, your have a line <code>print(2)</code>, without indentation in the continuation line, which is treated as part of the block. That is why it is failing with <code>SyntaxError</code>.</p></div>
<span class="comment-copy">This is weird. Works in ipython but not in python shell</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Umang Gupta is right, it is really weird, but if you want to avoid it, you can do an else statement</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I thought it just means you need to enter a blank line to end and evaluate the multi-line construct. It seems not only that...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's not really a great docs quote for this, because "continuation lines" in that documentation doesn't just refer to the blank line. (The previous paragraph says "for continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (<code>...</code>)", and the <code>the_world_is_flat</code> example is showing what kinds of lines the <code>...</code> prompt is used for.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's a more relevant statement <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#first-steps-towards-programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer">later in the tutorial</a>: "When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line)."</span>
