<p>I was trying to clean up my code instead of using a bunch of if statements to functions. Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>def tic(inpinp, board, qweqwe):
    global lik 
    ink = inpinp - 1
    lik = board.insert(ink, qweqwe)


lis = ['  ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  ', '  ',  '  ', '  ']

p = input("Player 1, would you like to be X or O?")
inpu = int(input("Where would you like to go?"))






print('{}|{}|{}'.format())
print('--|--|--'.format())
print('{}|{}|{}'.format())
print("--|--|--".format())
print('{}|{}|{}'.format())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm assuming you're wondering why you get an <code>IndexError</code> from the above code (since there are no explicit <code>tuple</code>s or indexing going on in it).</p>
<p><code>'{}|{}|{}'.format()</code> implicitly means <code>'{0}|{1}|{2}'.format()</code>, where the <code>0</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">indicate indices into the positional arguments</a> passed to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>format</code></a>. Problem is, you didn't pass any arguments, so when it indexes the <code>tuple</code> of arguments with <code>0</code>, it immediately fails, raising <code>IndexError</code>. You need to pass as many arguments as you provided placeholders for in the format string.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">oops! actually, my code begins with lik = 0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For the record, I answered the question from your title as relates to the code in the question body, but I have no idea how what you posted has anything to do with converting <code>if</code> statements to functions or the like; the function you defined is never called, and none of this really makes a lot of sense.</span>
