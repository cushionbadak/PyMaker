<p>I am new to python so apologies for the naive question. I have a list </p>
<pre><code>l1 = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8] 
</code></pre>
<p>and another list of tuples </p>
<pre><code>l2 = [(4,6), (6,8), (8,10)]
</code></pre>
<p>I want to output a list <code>l3</code> of size <code>l1</code> that compares the value of <code>l1</code> to the first co-ordinates of <code>l2</code> and stores the second co-ordinate if the first co-ordinate is found in <code>l1</code>, else stores 0.</p>
<p>output : </p>
<pre><code>l3 = [0, 6, 8, 0, 10]
</code></pre>
<p>I tired to do a for loop like:</p>
<pre><code>l3 = []
for i in range(len(l1)):
   if l1[i] == l2[i][0]:
      l3.append(l2[i][1])
   else:
      l3.append(0)  
</code></pre>
<p>but this doesn't work. It gives the error </p>
<pre><code>IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>
<p>which is obvious as <code>l2</code> is shorter than <code>l1</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can create a dictionary from <code>l2</code>:</p>
<pre><code>l1 = [2,4,6,7,8] 
l2 =[(4,6),(6,8),(8,10)]
new_l2 = dict(l2)
l3 = [new_l2.get(i, 0) for i in l1]
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>l3 = [0,6,8,0,10]
</code></pre>

<p>I would always use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50824660/6272142">Ajax1234's solution</a> instead, but I wanted to illustrate how I would approach it using a for-loop, as you intended: </p>
<pre><code>l3 = []
for elem in l1:
    pairs = list(filter(lambda x: x[0] == elem, l2))
    l3.append(pairs[0][1] if pairs else 0)
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>An alternate approach would be using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>next()</code></a> and a list comprehension instead of <code>filter()</code> and a for-loop. This one is far more efficient and readable:</p>
<pre><code>l3 = [next((u[1] for u in l2 if u[0] == elem), 0) for elem in l1]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Will there ever be a case of multiple tuples in <code>l2</code> having the same first element?  If so, what's the rule there?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like <code>l2</code> should be a dictionary instead of a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jedwards no it won't have multiple same first elements.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well done on asking a sensible question with properly formatted code, input data,  required output <i>and</i> an error message. This is quite rare on stackoverflow. Please ask more questions like this!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Elegant solution, naive method would be using loop inside a loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hi @Robáµ©  done! thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jenny I'm glad it helps! Note that I've added another approach using <code>next()</code>, which should be far more elegant than the previous one. Make sure to check that out too, as this function can be particularly useful in Python.</span>
