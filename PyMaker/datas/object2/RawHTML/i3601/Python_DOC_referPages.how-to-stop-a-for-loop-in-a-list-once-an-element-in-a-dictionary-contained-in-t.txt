<p>I have just started to learn Python and I have a question regarding the FOR LOOP and how to make it loop until he finds a specific element in a list and then make it stop without iterating through the other list's elements :</p>
<p>I created two python file: 1) Database.py 2) App.py</p>
<p>In "Database.py" I have the following code:</p>
<pre><code>books = []
</code></pre>
<p>In "App.py" I have this code:</p>
<pre><code>def prompt_read_book():
    book_to_search = input("Write the NAME of the book you want to mark as 'READ':\n")
    for book in database.books:
        if book_to_search.lower() == book["name"]:
            print(f"The book '{book_to_search}' is now marked as READ")
            book["read"] = True
            print("-" * 40)
        else:
            print(f"Sorry but the book {book_to_search} is not in the database")
            print("-" * 40)
</code></pre>
<p>When I have more than 1 book (2 or more) in my <code>books</code> list, the function I wrote does not work as I expected.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>books = [{"name": "Fight Club", "author": "Chuck Palahniuk", "read": False}, {"name": "Homo Deus", "author": "Yuval Noah Harari", "read": False}]
</code></pre>
<p>I want to "mark as READ" only the book with name "Fight Club".
So I input the name "Fight Club".
The <code>book_to_search</code> variable becomes: <code>Fight Club</code>
The function runs correctly and changes the <code>{"read": False}</code> to <code>{"read": True}</code></p>
<p>HOWEVER</p>
<p>Since I am in the for loop, it keeps iterating and it also prints:
"Sorry but the book Homo Deus is not in the database"
<em>(My understanding of the problem is the following: since we are in a for loop, the program checks one by one all the elements of the list to find if they match with the input the user wrote. Thus I need a way to stop the for loop once the matching element has been found).</em></p>
<p>What I would like is the following:</p>
<p>-Once the <code>book_to_search</code> matches with the element of the dictionary, the for loop has to stop without iterating the others list' elements</p>
<p>-If the <code>book_to_search</code> does to match with any element in the dictionary, I want to print <code>"Sorry but the book {book_to_search} is not in the database"</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>add a <code>break</code> once the book has been found, and declare a <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> to a variable that detects if it's been found:</p>
<pre><code>def prompt_read_book():
    book_to_search = input("Write the NAME of the book you want to mark as 'READ':\n")
    found = False
    for book in database.books:
        if book_to_search.lower() == book["name"]:
            print(f"The book '{book_to_search}' is now marked as READ")
            book["read"] = True
            print("-" * 40)
            found = True
            break

    if not found:
        print(f"Sorry but the book {book_to_search} is not in the database")
        print("-" * 40)
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT: i just edited my answer since i misread the last part. now it will only print the "Sorry but..." if it wasn't found.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This will still print the "Sorry" message for every other book before that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Barmar whoops, i misread the last part of the question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I understand the "break" advice and I tried it, many thanks. However, I get another problem if I set the "break". Basically, if I want to change from {"read": False} to {"read": True} in the second (or third etc.) element of the list, I get printed the string ("Sorry but the book {book_to_search} is not in the database") because the first element has been iterated even if it does not match what the user has written.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FBSO please check the edit i just made. hopefully that fixes the issue. as far as what you're saying about changing "read" to True... do you mean on all occurrences of the book?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@crookedleaf Yes, for all the occurrences. The edit you made solved the issue. Thanks.</span>
