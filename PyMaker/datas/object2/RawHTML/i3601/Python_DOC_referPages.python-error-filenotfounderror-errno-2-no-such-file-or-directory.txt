<p>You need to add a "\" to the end of your folder path.</p>
<p><code>folder_path = 'T:\04. Testing\3. Wear Testing\TESTS\CKUW\180604 OP STRAPLESS\Survey Response Data\</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">show us the code and a full stack trace</span>
<span class="comment-copy">We need to see the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The file or directory doesn't exist. You need to make it exist.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, I think you are missing a "\" symbol in your folder path. Try use the inline code to outline problem and put more details in the question, so people will be able to help you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You would join them using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b><code>os.path.join</code></b></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OP is not using <code>os.path.join</code> but simply concatenating two strings, thus missing a back slash</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Trevor Davies thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@A.B. yes, but using <code>os.path.join</code> is the correct way to do it.</span>
