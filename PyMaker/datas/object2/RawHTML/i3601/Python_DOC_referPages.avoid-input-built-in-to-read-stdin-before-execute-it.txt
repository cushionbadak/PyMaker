<p>I detect that input builtin capture everything from stdin even before execute it. For example:</p>
<pre><code>import time

for n in range(5):
    time.sleep(1)
    # write now something, during the loop

example = input('input something: ')
print("you have written {}".format(example))
</code></pre>
<p>Trying to flush stdin with sys module before capture input don't work, because if you press "ENTER", for example, this is captured anyway:</p>
<pre><code>import time, sys

for n in range(5):
    time.sleep(1)
    # write now something, during the loop

sys.stdin.flush()
example = input('input something: ')
print("you have written {}".format(example))
</code></pre>
<p>How I can avoid this behaviour and only start to capture the stdin when "input" statement is executed?</p>

<p>One way is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/termios.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">termios module</a> (POSIX only):</p>
<pre><code>import time, termios, sys

for n in range(5):
    time.sleep(1)
    # write now something, during the loop

termios.tcflush(sys.stdin, termios.TCIOFLUSH)
example = input('input something: ')
print("you have written {}".format(example))

<span class="comment-copy">on which platform does that work?</span>
