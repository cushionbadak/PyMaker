<p>I am currently using Excel 2010. I want to parse through all the excel files under a specified path in my system for a specific string (for eg: address).I want to copy all the rows which contain the word address in any of its cells into a notepad.
Should I use openpyxl or pandas? Please help with a basic outline on how I need to go about with this.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Sorry, I can't comment so I'm posting as an answer. I used the following code for a very similar application. Hope this is right for you. </p>
<p><strong>Note: I didn't understand whether you wanted to print an entire row containing keyword 'address' or just the cell containing the keyword. This code is for the latter.</strong> </p>
<pre><code>book = open_workbook('Bookl.xlsx')
s=0
for sheet in book.sheets():

    for rowidx in range(sheet.nrows):
        row = sheet.row(rowidx)
        for colidx, cell in enumerate(row):
            if cell.value == 'address':
                address.append(str(sheet.cell(rowidx, colidx)))
                s+=1

f= open("text.txt","w+")
for x in range(0,s):
    f.write(address[x])
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Also for iterating over different excel files in a folder, I don't have much idea. I read online that maybe <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">glob</a> module could help you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you put some sample data, and expected output that you want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can use pandas if you're familiar with it.</span>
