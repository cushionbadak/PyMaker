<p>My problem is, after calling the function <code>check_win</code> in the <code>gameloop</code>,
even though the function evaluates false(I've checked so this is the
case), I assign this false value to <code>gamePlaying</code> inside the loop,
however the game loop <code>gamePlaying</code> conditional still evaluates true
and keeps going. </p>
<pre><code>def check_win(): #function checks for three in a row across, down, and diagonals
        for x in range (0, 3) :
            y = x*3
            if (board[y] == board[(y + 1)] and board[y] == board[(y + 2)]):
                gamePlaying = False
            else:
                gamePlaying = True
            if (board[x] == board[(x + 3)] and board[x] == board[(x + 6)]):
                gamePlaying = False
            else:
                gamePlaying = True
            if((board[0] == board[4] and board[0] == board[8]) or 
                (board[2] == board[4] and board[4] == board[6])):
                gamePlaying = False
            else:
                gamePlaying = True
        return(gamePlaying)

    currentPlayer = [first_player,second_player] #creates list to iterate over turns
    gamePlaying = True #bool for gameloop

    while gamePlaying: #main game loop
        for i in currentPlayer: #iterates over current player to switch turns

            draw_board()
            place_move = int(input(first_move + ' what is your move? ')) #inputs then places move for first_player
            board[place_move] = first_player
            gamePlaying = check_win() #should take bool output of check_win and store to cont or end gameloop

            draw_board()

<p>The issue is that you are using <code>if</code> statements when you mean to use <code>elif</code>. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>.</p>
<p>However, what you probably want to do is <code>return False</code> at those points since that would allow the function to exit early and you would have to worry that <code>gamePlaying</code> gets set back to <code>True</code> by later <code>if</code> statements. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">that other check win shouldnt be capitalized but it still doesnt work</span>
