<p>I am trying to create a python script that can read a text file of numbers and set every other number into a list of x coordinates and does the same thing for y. then i am trying to create a loop that can move the mouse using the x and y list. I am fairly new to python and i keep getting supplied sequence must have 2 element errors. I don't know if their is anything that i am doing wrong.
the list of numbers looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 2 3 4</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and my code is this</p>
<pre><code>import pyautogui

pyautogui.FAILSAFE = True
f = open('mouse_log.txt', 'r')
coords = [] 

for line in f:
    inftemp = line.strip()
    coords.append(inftemp)

xlist = []
ylist = []

xlist.append(coords[::2])
ylist.append(coords[1::2])

temp = 0

for x in coords:
    pyautogui.moveTo(xlist[temp],ylist[temp])
    temp = temp + 1
</code></pre>

<p>With your example, <code>coords</code> is a list of 4 numbers, and <code>xlist</code> and <code>ylist</code> are lists of 2 numbers.</p>
<p>You loop over the four elements in <code>coords</code>, adding 1 to <code>temp</code> each time. So, you're looking up <code>xlist[0], ylist[0]</code>, then <code>xlist[1], ylist[1]</code>, then <code>xlist[2], ylist[2]</code>, then <code>xlist[3], ylist[3]</code>. But there <em>is</em> no <code>xlist[2]</code>, <code>ylist[2]</code>, <code>xlist[3]</code>, or <code>ylist[3]</code>, so of course you're going to get an error if you try to access them.</p>
<p>What you want to do is loop 2 times, not 4â€”or, more generally, loop over the number of elements in <code>xlist</code> and <code>ylist</code>, not the number of elements in <code>coords</code>.</p>
<p>The cleanest way to do this is to just loop over the lists directly, instead of trying to figure out a number to loop over. The only tricky bit is that you have two separate lists, which you want to loop over in lock-step with each other. But that's exactly what <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> is for:</p>
<pre><code>for x, y in zip(xlist, ylist):
    pyautogui.moveTo(x, y)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Copy and paste the actual (complete) exception here, don't just give us a vague description of it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert just did</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK, the error message you've given us doesn't match the problem you claim you're having.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert I changed it to state my problem</span>
