<p>My main app is running with Python3</p>
<p>I have a crucial package that I need to install which only support Python2...</p>
<p>I'm running on windows</p>
<p>I thought of maybe setting this package on another virtual environment in addition to a flask server to be used for communication.</p>
<p>Is there another way to pipe messages between apps beside a server?</p>
<p>Is there a better way to go for Python2, Python3 mix?</p>

<p>How about using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess</a> module. You can start the Python 2 program as a subprocess of your Python 3 app. They can communicate via the subprocess PIPE. </p>

<p>Flask is too heavy. Why not use socket and selectors?  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/selectors.html#selectors.EpollSelector" rel="nofollow noreferrer">offical example</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">maybe ask about the packages you're using... there might be alternatives to the package or maybe alternatives to the packages that are forcing you to use python 3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is your answer to this question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In my opinion, just building a socket for send&amp;receive message is convenient and light way which communicate between Python2 and Python3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">was just confused why you implied OP uses flask</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh, I see in the middle now</span>
