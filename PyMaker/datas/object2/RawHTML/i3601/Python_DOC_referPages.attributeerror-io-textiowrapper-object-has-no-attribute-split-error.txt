<p>You have not read your file to return a string you have a file object. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To read a file’s contents, call f.read(size), which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string (in text mode) or bytes object (in binary mode). size is an optional numeric argument. When size is omitted or negative, the entire contents of the file will be read and returned; it’s your problem if the file is twice as large as your machine’s memory. Otherwise, at most size bytes are read and returned. If the end of the file has been reached, f.read() will return an empty string ('').</p>

<p>You just need to read it and it should work:</p>
<pre><code>file = open("products.txt","r")
productsFile = file.read()
print (productsFile.split(","))
</code></pre>
<p>Don't forget to close your file:</p>
<pre><code>file.close()
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Or better practice:</strong></p>
<pre><code>with open("products.txt","r") as file:
    productsFile = file.read()
</code></pre>
<p>This will automatically close the file for you.</p>
<hr/>
<p><code>'_io.TextIOWrapper'</code> is what is returned when you open a file (but have not read/written in it).  You can test this by using the interactive interpreter:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;open('file.txt', 'r')
&lt;_io.TextIOWrapper name='file.txt' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can determine three things from this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the file.</li>
<li>The encoding.</li>
<li>the mode that <code>open()</code> has been set in.</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">You're trying to call <code>split</code> on a file object. File objects don't have such a method, which is exactly what the error is saying. If you want to read the whole file into one giant string, you can do that with <code>productsData = productsFile.read()</code>, and then <code>productsData.split()</code> is fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hint: <code>productsFile.split(",")</code> won't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@scharette How is that a hint? That's what's in the code, and he's already got an exception pointing to exactly that expression telling him it doesn't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert I thought it was relevant for him to try himself before, since as you said the error is really verbose. Feel free to give him the entire answer yourself (as you already did) and miss the opportunity for him to practice using the exception returns (in my opinion).</span>
