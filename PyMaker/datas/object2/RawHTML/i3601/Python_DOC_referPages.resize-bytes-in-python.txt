<p>I read file from disk and in case if its size less than 256 bytes I need to extend it. Some think like:</p>
<pre><code>data = open("test.txt", "rb").read()
if ( len(data) &lt; 256  ):
    data.resize( 256 ) # Fill with zeroes or something
</code></pre>
<p>But since bytes is immutable type there is no anything like resize method.</p>
<p>I don't need to modify original file, I need len(data) to be not less than 256 for further processing.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to extend it with spaces:</p>
<pre><code>data = open("test.txt", "rb").read()
padding_character = ' '  # space
data += padding_character*(256-len(data))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>zfill</code> for str and bytes alike:</p>
<pre><code>data = b'abc'
data = data.zfill(20) # or 256 in your case
print(data)
# b'00000000000000000abc'
</code></pre>
<p>Note: If your data length is already 256 (or whatever value you use) or more, <code>zfill</code> will return the original object.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>padding_character = b'\0'</code> is probably more what was intended.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But did they want to fill on the left or on the right? And with a literal <code>'0'</code> or with the null byte <code>b'\0'</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MarkRansom: That's indeed not clear, but my answer fits the vague "<code>Fill with zeroes or something</code>" requirement from the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was just pointing out the ambiguity, not dinging you for it. But since it's a binary file I would have made different assumptions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need filling new data from right not left, I think ljust is what I am looking for</span>
