<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a string which contains several pairs of 2D co-ordinate points as follows:</p>
<pre><code>input = '(1, 2), (3, 5.5), (7, -2), (16, 0), (5, 3)'
</code></pre>
<p>I want to take this string and end up with two lists, named X and Y which contain the X and Y co-ordinates respectively of the points in the string (in their original order):</p>
<p>outputs:</p>
<pre><code>X = ['1', '3', '7', '16', '5']

Y = ['2', '5.5', '-2', '0', '3']
</code></pre>
<p>How can I do this using Python 3?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <strong><code>zip</code></strong> with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong><code>ast.literal_eval</code></strong></a></p>
<pre><code>s = '(1, 2), (3, 5.5), (7, -2), (16, 0), (5, 3)'
x, y = zip(*ast.literal_eval(s))

x
(1, 3, 7, 16, 5)

y
(2, 5.5, -2, 0, 3)
</code></pre>
<p>If you are set on the output being a list, you can use:</p>
<pre><code>x, y = map(list, zip(*ast.literal_eval(s)))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Don't name variables <code>input</code>.  It overrides a builtin</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In my program I didn't name it input, I just did it here to show that is the kind of input that the program will take.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OP, note the necessary <code>import ast</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, this worked great :)</span>
