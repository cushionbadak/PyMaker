<p>I have the following directory structure (pretty standard for a python distribution):</p>
<pre><code>/some_dir
  /common
    file1.dat
    file2.dat
  /src
    pkg1/
      __init__.py
      stuff.py
    setup.py
</code></pre>
<p>What I want to achieve is package both <code>pkg1</code> and <code>common</code> into the same python egg. The <code>setup.py</code> file is pretty standard (auto discover packages) and <code>pkg1</code> is properly included, unfortunately I can't say the same about <code>common</code>. I tried many things, like <code>package_data</code>, <code>package_data_files</code>, <code>package_dir</code>, etc. Nothing seems to work. How can I achieve this?</p>
<p>I'm also not keen on keeping this structure, but I do need those files into a common directory, because I have to generate nodejs, python and java libraries that include them, thus moving the <code>common/</code> directory inside python is not an option.</p>

<p>I think you should use a <strong>MANIFEST.in</strong> file and set <strong>include_package_data</strong> to <strong>True</strong> to register all the files you want to bundle with your package.</p>
<p><a href="https://setupy.info/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://setupy.info/</a> gives a pretty good overview of all the options you might need.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The correct name is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-package-data" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>data_files</code></a>, not <code>package_data_files</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">unfortunately, that does not work. MANIFEST.in need to be defined next to setup.py, and can't properly include directories/files from upper path (it works, but it's copied in a wrong location).</span>
