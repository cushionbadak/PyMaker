<p>I read all the topics talking about how to run both of them using Environment ...</p>
<p>But in my case am using a batch script in my ConEmu configuration file</p>

<p>How to make my code work !</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are using the Python included <code>venv</code>, then something like this might work. This should automatically pick up the Lib directories. Let me know if this does not work.</p>
<pre><code>if "%python%" == "python3" (
    @CALL C:\python3\Scripts\Activate.bat

<span class="comment-copy">Batch... in cygwin? Why are you trying to use batch in cygwin?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oooh sorry it not cygwin it ConEmu kind of a configuration file in batch...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could possibly use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Launcher for Windows</a> instead to choose Python version. Works in CMD console and ConEmu.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well my problem how I can make this code work I mean when I type in console python2 takes me to python2 Libs automatically I made that code just to get fixed I need how to set and get the value from console command</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I do not yet understand. When you type <code>python2</code> or <code>python3</code> as a command, do you want the python.exe interpreter to run from the correct version?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Exactly python2 hello.py goes directly to python2.exe and the same if I type python3 sorry for my English maybe am not giving the right problem that am facing !</span>
