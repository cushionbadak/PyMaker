<p>I'm struggling to get my code to work. I've been supplied with some variables to work with: The variable <strong>P</strong> is my file path, designated as content/textfiles/empty.txt; while the variable <strong>S</strong> is my string, designated as parrot. The end goal is to find out how many times Parrot (S) appears in my text file (P). The following is the variables and information I have been supplied with, and immediately following is my crude code that is attempting to complete my task:</p>
<pre><code>    import sys
    P= sys.argv[1]
    S= sys.argv[2]

    file = open(P,'r')
    data = file.read()

    count = 0
    if S in P:
        count += 1
    print(count)
    file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>The primary issue is that I am supposed to have a return of 3 for output, but my code is only counting 1 occurrence, but I have no idea why.</p>
</div>

<p>[Answer previously posted on question]:</p>
<pre><code>file = open(P,'r')
data = file.read()
count = data.count(S)
print(count)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You aren't actually counting the number of occurrences anywhere. You only ever increment count once.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Check the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods" rel="nofollow noreferrer">count method</a> of strings, such as your <code>data</code> variable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Rory! That did the trick!  It took me a bit to understand, but after editing my code, I got it to work! I'm editing my post with the solution!</span>
