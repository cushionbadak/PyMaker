<p>Is there a way to enforce the type of a variable in a python function ? Or at least, give an indication of what it should be ?
I already saw things like :</p>
<pre><code>var -&gt; int
</code></pre>
<p>But I don't know the name of that syntax, nor its use.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>It's called <code>Type Hints</code>, has been introduced in Python 3.5 and is described here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html</a></p>
<p>See also PEP 484: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/</a></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>def greeting(name: str) -&gt; str:
    return 'Hello ' + name
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this will not <em>enforce</em> the type.</p>
<p>From the PEP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While these annotations are available at runtime through the usual <code>__annotations__</code> attribute, no type checking happens at runtime. Instead, the proposal assumes the existence of a separate off-line type checker which users can run over their source code voluntarily.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">there is not, python is not strictly typed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so what does this syntax means ? a:var-&gt;int ? And  I know it is not stricly typed but my question is : or, is there a way to give an indication?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and I don't know why someone would feel the urge to downvote the question.. I am just looking for the vocabulary involved to be able to search the PEP for advice.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">To enforce the type, just add ad an assertion in your function <code>assert type(name) is str</code></span>
