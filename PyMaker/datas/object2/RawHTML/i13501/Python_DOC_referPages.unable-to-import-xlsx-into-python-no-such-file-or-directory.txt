<p>I'm trying to import data from HW3_Yld_Data.xlsx into Python. I made sure that the Excel file is in the same directory as the Python file. Here's what I wrote:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

Z = pd.read_excel('HW3_Yld_Data.xlsx')
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the error I got:</p>
<pre><code>In [2]: import pandas as pd
   ...: 
   ...: Z = pd.read_excel('HW3_Yld_Data.xlsx')
Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "&lt;ipython-input-2-7237c05c79ba&gt;", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
    Z = pd.read_excel('HW3_Yld_Data.xlsx')

  File "/Users/Zhengnan/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pandas/io/excel.py", line 151, in read_excel
return ExcelFile(io, engine=engine).parse(sheetname=sheetname, **kwds)

  File "/Users/Zhengnan/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pandas/io/excel.py", line 188, in __init__
self.book = xlrd.open_workbook(io)

  File "/Users/Zhengnan/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/xlrd/__init__.py", line 394, in open_workbook
f = open(filename, "rb")

IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'HW3_Yld_Data.xlsx'
</code></pre>
<p>What's mind-boggling is that it used to work fine. It appeared to stop working after I did a "conda update --all" yesterday.</p>
<p>BTW I'm using Spyder as IDE. Please help. Thank you.</p>

<p>Each process in the operating system has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory" rel="nofollow">current working directory</a>. Any relative path is relative to the current working directory.</p>
<p>The current working directory is set to the directory from which you launched the process. This is very natural when using the command-line, but get be confusing for people only using GUIs.</p>
<p>You can retrieve it using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getcwd" rel="nofollow"><code>os.getcwd()</code></a>, and you can change it using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chdir" rel="nofollow"><code>os.chdir()</code></a>. Of course, you can also change it before launching your script.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of using the relative path, use the full path of your xlsx for a test. Your conda update may have changed your environment.</p>
<p>You can try something like this in order to test it:</p>
<pre><code>import os
pre = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
fname = 'HW3_Yld_Data.xlsx'
path = os.path.join(pre, fname)
Z = pd.read_excel(path)
