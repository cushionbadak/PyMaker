<p>The problem I am having is that I do not know how to fix this part of my code where I get the <code>"TypeError: Can't convert 'float' object to str implicitly"</code></p>
<pre><code>z = ((a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k+l)/12)
</code></pre>
<p>I am running python 3.4.3</p>
<p>If anyone knows what modules I can import for standard deviation or mean that would be helpful</p>

<p>One or more of your variables, at the very least <code>a</code>, but extending to <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, etc., is a string object. You cannot add a floating point number to the string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '' + 0.0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: Can't convert 'float' object to str implicitly
</code></pre>
<p>You could just use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html" rel="nofollow"><code>statistics</code> module</a> to calculate a mean and standard deviation, however; there is both a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.mean" rel="nofollow"><code>mean()</code></a> and a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.stdev" rel="nofollow"><code>stdev()</code> function</a> available. Just make sure all your variables are proper floats:</p>
<pre><code>from statistics import mean, stdev

values = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l]
float_values = [float(v) for v in values]
mean_value = mean(float_values)
stdev_value = stdev(float_values)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that it'll be much easier to deal with <em>one</em> variable holding a list of those values rather than use 12 separate variables.</p>

<p>I have made the same mistake myself many times. Just remember: You can't add different data types together. Here is a great way to combine them though:</p>
<pre><code>userID = 5
return userID
userIDcopy = str(userID)
print "Welcome User "+userIDcopy
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So what are the values of all the variables involved?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You seem to be asking two entirely different things; why do you think importing something will solve a type problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Be sure that none of your variable is string.</span>
