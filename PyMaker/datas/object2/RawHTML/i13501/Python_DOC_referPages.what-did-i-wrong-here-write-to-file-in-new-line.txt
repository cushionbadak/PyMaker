<p>I want to make a simple function that writes two words to a file each on a new line.
But if I run this code it only writes "tist - tost" to the file.</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>def write_words(word1, word2):
    w = open("output.txt", "w")
    w.write(word1 + " - " + word2 + '\n')
    w.close()

write_words("test", "tast")
write_words("tist", "tost")
</code></pre>
<p>Output: </p>
<pre><code>tist - tost
</code></pre>
<p>How can I write the two phrases to the file?</p>
</div>

<p>You need to open your file in append mode, also as a more pythonic way for opening a file you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement"><em><code>with</code> statement</em></a> which close the file at the end of block :</p>
<pre><code>def write_words(word1, word2):
    with open("output.txt", "a") as f :
        f.write(word1 + " - " + word2 + '\n')
</code></pre>
