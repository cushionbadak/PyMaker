<p>So i was trying to create a simple calculator and i thought that there isn't anything wrong with this code but when i ran the code, it said that there's SyntaxError : unexpected EOF while parsing ([string], line 1)  and i tried several changes but i still can't see the mistake, please help me??  </p>
<pre><code>operation = input ("Pick your operation:  +  |  -  |  *  |  /   ")

    if operation == '+' :
        no1 = int(input ("Pick a number"))
        no2 = int(input ("Pick another number"))
        answer = no1 + no2
        print ( "Answer:", no1 , "+" , no2 , "=", answer)

    elif operation == '-':
        no1 = int(input ("Pick a number"))
        no2 = int(input ("Pick another number"))
        answer = no1 - no2
        print ( "Answer:", no1 , "-" , no2 , "=" , answer)

    elif operation == '*':
        no1 = int(input ("Pick a number"))
        no2 = int(input ("Pick another number"))
        answer = no1 * no2
        print ( "Answer:", no1 , "*" , no2 , "=", answer)

    elif operation == '/':
        no1 = int(input ("Pick a number"))
        no2 = int(input ("Pick another number"))
        answer = no1 / no2
        print ( "Answer:", no1 , "/" , no2 , "=", answer)

    else:
        print ("Please check your given options of operations.")

<p>Your line is valid, both in Python 2 and 3 but it makes sense in Python 3 only.</p>
<p>There has been a change in the behavior of input between versions.</p>
<p>In Python 2 you have to use <code>raw_input</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code>operation = raw_input("Pick your operation:  +  |  -  |  *  |  /   ")
</code></pre>
<p>Read the docs at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/functions.html#input</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input</a> for details.</p>

<p>You need to use <code>raw_input</code> for python versions &lt; 3.0. You may want to check <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">behavior of input</a></p>
