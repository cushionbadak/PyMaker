<p>I'm writing a test suite in py.test for a class that uses ftplib and such for FTP things.  I need to disrupt the connection I'm using to simulate network problems and cover an exception. Please note, for this project I was required to use a real FTP server instead of mocks, so mocks won't help (I think).</p>
<p>Is there a simple way I can interrupt the port / socket to simulate problems?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time</p>

<p>The <code>FTP</code> class has the <code>sock</code> field.</p>
<p>If you call the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.close" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.close</code> method</a> on it, you terminate the FTP session control connection.</p>
