<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to directly edit an XML file's text. I'd prefer to find and remove a certain phrase potentially by using the "sub" function. For particular reasons I'd prefer not to return the edited strings and then find a way to replace the existing XML file test. Is there an easy way to do this? Thanks for any help. </p>

<p>No, in Python you can not change strings in place as Python strings are immutable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Python strings are immutable...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So your saying I have no choice but to create a copy and swap the strings?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's the easiest way. Another option is to use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/mmap.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mmap</a> memory-mapped file object.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that in-file updates are only possible if the old and new strings have the exact same number of bytes.</span>
