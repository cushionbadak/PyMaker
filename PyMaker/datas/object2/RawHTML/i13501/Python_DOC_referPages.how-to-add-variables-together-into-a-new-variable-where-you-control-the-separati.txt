<p>Let's say i've declared three variables which are a date, how can I combine them into a new variable where i can print them in the correct 1/2/03 format by simply printing the new variable name. </p>
<pre><code>month = 1
day = 2
year = 03

date = month, day, year  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; What would this code have to be? 

print(date)
</code></pre>
<p>I know i could set the sep='/' argument in the print statement if i call all three variables individually, but this means i can't add addition text into the print statement without it also being separated by a /. therefore i need a single variable i can call.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.join()</code></a> method does what you want (assuming the input is strings):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '/'.join((month, day, year))
1/2/03
</code></pre>
<p>As does all of Python's <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/5082452/113632">formatting options</a>, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '%s/%s/%s' % (month, day, year)
1/2/03
</code></pre>
<p>But date formatting (and working with dates in general) is tricky, and there are existing tools to do it "right", namely the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime</code></a> module, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.strftime" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>date.strftime()</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; date = datetime.date(2003, 1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; date.strftime('%m/%d/%y')
'01/02/03'
&gt;&gt;&gt; date.strftime('%-m/%-d/%y')
'1/2/03'
</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>-</code> before the <code>m</code> and the <code>d</code> to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2073189/113632">suppress leading zeros</a> on the month and date.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow"><code>join</code></a> method. You can also use a list comprehension to format the strings so they are each 2 digits wide.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '/'.join('%02d' % i for i in [month, day, year])
'01/02/03'
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>join()</code> function will also work in this case, but learning about <code>str.format()</code> will be more useful to you in the long run.</p>

<p>The <em>correct</em> answer is: use the <code>datetime</code> module:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime

month = 1
day = 2
year = 2003

date = datetime(year, month, day)
print(date)
print(date.strftime("%m/%d/%Y"))

# etc
</code></pre>
<p>Trying to handle dates as tuples is just a PITA, so don't waste your time.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Note that your month, day, and year variables should be strings (e.g. <code>year = '03'</code>; otherwise the leading zero will be dropped.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to Stack Overflow! Thank you for asking a good question: you showed us what you've tried so far, and explained what you were trying to do.

<span class="comment-copy">According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ISO 8601</a> <code>1/2/03</code> isn't the correct format. ;-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@dimo414 - Actually, it's better to use integers for months, days and years, because you can't do math on strings. You should only convert them to strings (with something like <code>str.format()</code>) when you're ready to print them out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You <i>definitely</i> should not treat dates as integers if you're intending to do math.  Use the appropriate date libraries for date arithmetic.  If OP just wants to print a numeric value with a leading zero, they should use strings.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good idea pointing him to <code>datetime</code>. I think he should also look into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.format</code></a>, as that's something every Python beginner should learn about.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your <code>.join</code> method seems to be more magic than mine, because mine is complaining about "expected string, int found" (Trivially fixed with <code>'/'.join(map(str,(month,day,year)))</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't use ints to represent strings with leading zeros - see my comment on the question.</span>
