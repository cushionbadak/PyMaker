<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i a currently building a calculator in Tkinter. I've been searching a few youtube videos to define a few functions and i came across this:</p>
<pre><code>result = eval(self.string.get())
</code></pre>
<p>I understand that it is creating a new variable called result that holds the contents of string.get(), but i am unsure what 'Eval' does?</p>
<p>Help would be appreciated</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This takes the string as an expression and determines its value.  For instance, the string "3 + 5" would return 8.</p>
