<p>I'm very new to python and I am making a text based game. In the start I ask the users name. How would I add what the user input to when I "print"?</p>
<pre><code>print ("Welcome to my first game! It's not much but it's mine.")
print ("What is your name")
name = input()
</code></pre>
<p>In the code above how would I add the users name into the next line? For example It would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>print ("Hi """insert name here""", lets start!")
</code></pre>
<p>I hope I made this clear as I don't have a large enough Python vocabulary to make my ideas clear</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow">string formatting</a> to output what you desire:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hi {name}! Let's begin".format(name=name))
Hi Andy! Let's begin
</code></pre>
<p>This is using a named argument (<code>name</code>) and assigning your variable to it. You could also do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hi {}! Let's begin".format(name))
Hi Andy! Let's begin
</code></pre>
<p>This is using just a positional argument. If you have multiple fields to fill in, put them in the order they should appear:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hi {}! Let's {}".format(name, 'begin'))
Hi Andy! Let's begin

&gt;&gt;&gt; print("Hi {}! Let's {}".format(name, 'quit'))
Hi Andy! Let's quit
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here's one way to do it:</p>
<pre><code>print("Welcome to my first game! It's not much but it's mine.")
name = input("What is your name?")
print("Hi ", name, ", let's start!", sep="")
</code></pre>
<p>Here's another way using <code>.format</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print("Welcome to my first game! It's not much but it's mine.")
name = input("What is your name?")
print("Hi {} let's start!".format(name)) # Will replace "{}" with name
</code></pre>
