<p>I am trying to run the following code in Python which calls a Bash script file and saves its output to a variable. I am trying to use <code>subprocess.check_output</code> but it raises an error to the effect of "No such file or directory".  <code>subprocess.call</code> does not work either. Here is a bit of my code.</p>
<pre><code>answer = subprocess.check_output(['/directory/bashfile.bash -c /directory/file -i input -o output'])
print answer
</code></pre>
<p><code>-c</code> <code>-i</code> and <code>-o</code> are just arguments to the script <code>bashfile</code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that you are passing the entire command string rather than splitting them into args. You either need to pass it as a shell command:</p>
<pre><code>answer = subprocess.check_output('/directory/bashfile.bash -c /directory/file -i input -o output', 
                                 shell=True)
print answer
</code></pre>
<p>Or you need to tokenize it yourself:</p>
<pre><code>answer = subprocess.check_output(['/directory/bashfile.bash', 
                                  '-c', '/directory/file',
                                  '-i', 'input',
                                  '-o', 'output'])
print answer
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">can you explain exactly what "does not work". what happens when you run your code?</span>
