<p>Alright, so, what I'm trying to do is import a module in folders packed inside of a .pyd file. Here is something that would work for me:</p>
<pre><code>from apple import __init__
</code></pre>
<p>With apple being the .pyd in the same directory as the Python script, and __init__ of course being packed inside of the .pyd. This would work, however here is what I want to do, but doesn't work:</p>
<pre><code>from apple.seed.worm import WormManager
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation: apple = pyd, seed = directory in the pyd, worm = directory in seed directory in apple pyd, WormManager = python module in the worm directory.</p>
<p>However, it does not work, and results in a module not found ImportError thinking that seed is a module (and there was an __init__ inside of the seed directory before it was packed). Of course it exists and is packed in the .pyd, but it simply does not work. I even did this:</p>
<pre><code>from apple.seed import __init__
</code></pre>
<p>but not even that works so I know that I'm not importing this right.</p>
<p>I really could not find the correct syntax for getting this to work on the internet, and of course I know how to do this without a pyd involved, so any help?</p>

<p>You need to run <code>C:\path\to\pip\tool\pip install pyd</code> from the command line first.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm not sure but I think that Python cannot dynamically discover internal pyd API without importing it first.</p>
<p>You should try to import the pyd first:</p>
<pre><code>import apple
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can (probably) access the internal API:</p>
<pre><code>WM = apple.seed.worm.WormManager
</code></pre>
<p>Also, your <code>apple.pyd</code> dll file must contain a function <code>PyInit_apple()</code> per the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#is-a-pyd-file-the-same-as-a-dll" rel="nofollow">official documentation</a>. If it doesn't, or if it is ill-defined (doesn't define all the submodules), this may explain why you cannot do <code>from apple ...</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I just did, not exactly sure how this helps... could you elaborate a bit on how you solve the problem of importing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, I don't think you get what I mean. A .pyd is the same as a .dll, but for Python, not this d language thing.</span>
