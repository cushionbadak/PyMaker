<p>I'm currently working on a small project, but I got a problem, I don't know how to convert this <code>"2017-12-22T05:00:00+01:00</code>" time, to an readable time, I would like to get it to this format <code>"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"</code>. Without success so far, is there something I can do to archive this?</p>

<p>First you need to parse the input datetime string into a <code>datetime</code> object. Then convert the <code>datetime</code> object to the required format. The easiest way to do that is with the third-party <a href="https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dateutil</code></a> package. You can install it with <code>pip</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from dateutil.parser import parse
&gt;&gt;&gt; dt = parse('2017-12-22T05:00:00+01:00')
&gt;&gt;&gt; dt
datetime.datetime(2017, 12, 22, 5, 0, tzinfo=tzoffset(None, 3600))
</code></pre>
<p>Converting to a new format can be done with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.strftime()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
'2017-12-22 05:00:00'
</code></pre>

<p>If it's the same string each time, you could use something like this:</p>
<pre><code>time_string = '2017-12-22T05:00:00+01:00'
year = time_string.split('-')[0]
month = time_string.split('-')[1]
day = time_string.split('-')[2].split('T')[0]
time = time_string.split('T')[1].split(':')
hour = time[0]
minute = time[1]
second = time[2].split('+')[0]
print(second,minute,hour,day,month,year)
</code></pre>
<p>(but there's probably a much better way to do it.)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the fast help! This is what i needed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't seem like an answer to his question, I think he meant string conversion to another string which would be formatted little bit differently. Parsing of first string would still be part of the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh I misunderstood. apologies</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem, thanks for the help.</span>
