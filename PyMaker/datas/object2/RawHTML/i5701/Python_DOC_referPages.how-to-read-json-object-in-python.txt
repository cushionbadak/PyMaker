<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should pass the file <em>contents</em> (i.e. a string) to <code>json.loads()</code>, not the file object itself. Try this:</p>
<pre><code>with open(file_path) as f:
    data = json.loads(f.read())
    print(data[0]['text'])
</code></pre>
<p>There's also the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load" rel="noreferrer"><code>json.load()</code></a> function which accepts a file object and does the <code>f.read()</code> part for you under the hood.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>json.load()</code>, not <code>json.loads()</code>, if your input is a file-like object (such as a TextIOWrapper).</p>
<p>Given the following complete reproducer:</p>
<pre><code>import json, tempfile
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as f:
    f.write(b'{"text": "success"}'); f.flush()
    with open(f.name,'r') as lst:
        b = json.load(lst)
        print(b['text'])
</code></pre>
<p>...the output is <code>success</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">i got this error by using <b>load()</b> funciton.   ` the JSON object must be str, bytes or bytearray, not 'TextIOWrapper'`</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BilalButt, <code>load()</code> does not generate that error -- unlike <code>loads()</code>, which the code in the question uses, <code>load()</code> accepts file-like objects as input. If you assert that it does, edit your question to add a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> -- the shortest possible code someone else can run, without modifications, to see the problem themselves. (Right now the indentation is wrong, and nobody but you will have a <code>C:\Users\bilal butt</code> directory, so this isn't code other people can invoke).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for your quick rply .. i edit json file in my Question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The contents of the file aren't relevant -- the file could just contain <code>[]</code> and the error would be exactly the same. Thus, a <i>minimal</i> reproducer has no need to include anything more than <code>[]</code> as the file contents being parsed (but <i>should</i> actually create a file with those contents, if it can't be reproduced without one).</span>
