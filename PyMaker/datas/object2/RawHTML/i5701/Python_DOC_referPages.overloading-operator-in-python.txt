<p>Is it possible to overload the <code>[]</code> operator in python?</p>
<p>I want to access a method of a class by calling <code>classname[elementname]</code> (like in a dict).
This might seem unneccessary but the class encapsulates a database element with children that also have children that also have children that... You get the point.</p>
<p>If I know which child from the 3rd inheritance step I want to get I could then instead of:</p>
<pre><code>classnname.getChild(childname1).getChild(childname2).getChild(childname3)
</code></pre>
<p>use the shorter and cleaner:</p>
<pre><code>classnname[childname1][childname2][childname3]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to implement the magic method <code>__getitem__</code> on <code>classname</code></p>
<pre><code>class classname:
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        return self.getChild(key)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@kindall: Thanks that totally works! Why was I not able to find this with a google/stackoverflow search?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't know; what were you searching for? The first Google result for <code>Python operator overload</code> has the information you seek.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That first hit I did find and read and there was no <code>__getitem__</code> in that site... Maybe I was looking for the wrong things. Thanks again for your quick help!</span>
