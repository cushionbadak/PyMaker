<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm a beginner preparing myself for me exams , I need a little help and I know this is the best place where I can get help from. I have written a small code which is </p>
<pre><code>for i in range (days)
day=[]
day.append('monday')
day.append('tuesday')
print()
</code></pre>
<p>I need to know if i only want to print monday which is the first element of list what will be the code for it. I tried day.i(1) but it does not work can you please help me out with it. The code is in python.
Thank you.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>days=[]
days.append("Monday ")
days.append(" Tuesday")
print days[0]
</code></pre>
<h1>days[0] is the index position of your first element. (I.e, "Monday")</h1>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>My guess is you want this:</p>
<pre><code>day=[]
day.append('monday')
day.append('tuesday')
for i in range(day):
    print(day[i])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is a more simpler code.</p>
<pre><code>weekdays = []
weekdays.append('monday')
weekdays.append('tuesday')
weekdays[0] ## First element of the list will be printed
weekdays[1] ## Second element of the list will be printed
</code></pre>
<p>Edit : Sorry, I had to edit this answer two times. It was written in a hurry. Besides this is the first answer I am ever posting.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The code you've currently given isn't even runnable. You should edit this question and provide a functional example. Despite that, you should google for a Python tutorial and read through it, that will help you in the long run.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should be able to find out the answer in any basic python tutorials. It is a basic data structure used in python and is knows as <code>list</code>. You can access the list elements by using <code>list indexes</code> which starts from <i>0</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">I suggest you read the documentation or preferably some kind of Python tutorial</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print days[0]</code> isn't valid Python 3. Besides that, you've simply repeated already existing information.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oops... I am also a beginner... So I'm sorry....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tq for letting me know this bro</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, don't use <code>list</code> as a name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">right! it will mess up. Changing that right now!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Keep in mind that       weekdays[2]   is out of range..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your comments are wrong, <code>weekdays[1]</code> does not print the first element, it prints the second. Same for <code>weekdays[2]</code>, which is also out of range as mentioned. Index starts at 0, not 1.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Furthermore, this doesn't print anything unless you run it in REPL/ iPython</span>
