<p>For our lecture, we need to create a program. 
Now we are at a point where we need help. </p>
<p>Let´s assume we have this following list:</p>
<pre><code>[['W'], ['B'], ['B'], ['W'], ['B'], ['B'], ['B']]
</code></pre>
<p>Now, every letter  ('W', 'B') has a specific value 
Just when there are two letters after each other, a player will get the points. 
Example: </p>
<p>In the list above, player 'W' would not get any point, but Player 'B' would get 5 points. 2 Points since the second element and the third element are after each other, and 3 points since the fifth, the sixth and the seventh element are after each other.</p>
<p>I hope it is clear what i am talking about :)</p>
<p>So, how do i determine, how much elements after each other are of the same value? </p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.groupby</code></a> to iterate "groups" of equal elements in a list. Just determine the length of those groups and increase the scores accordingly:</p>
<pre><code>lst = ['W', 'B', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'B']
scores = {c: 0 for c in set(lst)}
for k, g in itertools.groupby(lst):
    n = len(list(g))
    if n &gt; 1:
        scores[k] += n
</code></pre>
<p>(Note: The solution is intentionally incomplete and using a slightly different input.)</p>
<p>Update: Assignment seems to be over; added full code.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Homework is meant for you to solve... unless you're willing to share the A+ you get when you turn in our solution ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the homework is the whole game. We are now stucking at this little point. I am not asking to create the whole game ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In the current state, we are searching for an appropriate built-in function. We know how to determine the amount of the values with collections.counter, but it does not help us to determine the length if an list is interruptet, e.G. 3 Times a 'B' and then a 'W'. Moreover, our teacher told us to use for this part of the work less than 25 lines</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why are the characters wrapped in single element lists?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In the first place, we created a game-board, of the range 7x7. The user is allowed to set a specific stone in one of this fields. By using <b>getitem</b> we receive this kind of format.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmn, we tried it - i don´t get how this should work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jim.Hoti Well, I tried it, too, and it works. This will group the list into groups of <code>[[W], [B, B], [W], [B, B, B]]</code>, then just check the elements per group.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, but what do you mean with scores[k] -&gt; scores value is not defined?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jim.Hoti Yes, that's what I meant with "intentionally incomplete". Can you think of a built-in data structure that could be used for that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I could by searching in the library, but we were discussing until now what effect this should have.</span>
