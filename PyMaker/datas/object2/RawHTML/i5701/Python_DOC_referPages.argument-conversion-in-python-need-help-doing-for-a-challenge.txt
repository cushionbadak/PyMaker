<p>Hello I'm a learning developer and I'm facing a challenge that i am so confused with it that i dont know where to even star from.</p>
<p>this is the challenge: </p>
<p>You'll probably want to use try and except on this one. You might have to not use the else block, though.
Write a function named squared that takes a single argument.
If the argument can be converted into an integer, convert it and return the square of the number (num ** 2 or num * num).
If the argument cannot be turned into an integer (maybe it's a string of non-numbers?), return the argument multiplied by its length. Look in the file for examples. </p>
<p>and in the coding section all there is is this: </p>
<pre><code># EXAMPLES
# squared(5) would return 25
# squared("2") would return 4
# squared("tim") would return "timtimtim"
</code></pre>
<p>I would really appreciate the help.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here's some psuedo code to get you started:</p>
<pre><code>def squared(num):
    try:
        # convert num to int
        # do multiplication logic
    except:
        # int conversion failed,
        # multiply num by its length

    return num
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks so much for you're response.  can you please give me the complete code for this. in the challenge i did everything i could but the code is still not passing. i would appreciate it if you could give me the complete code. thanks in advance.</span>
