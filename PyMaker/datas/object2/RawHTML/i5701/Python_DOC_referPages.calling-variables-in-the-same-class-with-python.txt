<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to call a variable defined in a function, inside another function of the same class, but with <code>self</code> doesn't work.</p>
<pre><code>class Project():
    def function1(self):
        a='hello world,'

    def function2(self):
        b=self.a + ' I am alive'

Project1=Project()
print Project1.function1()
print Project1.function2()
</code></pre>
<p>python says: <code>Project instance has no attribute 'a'</code>.</p>
<p>I don't know very well how to use classes. I didn't use <code>__init__</code> 'cause I do not have anything to put, is there maybe a way to add it even if I do not need it formally?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> variables are local. You can only use these variables in the method scope. If you want a class attribute (shared with all the class) you have to set the like <code>self.a = ...</code> and <code>self.b = ...</code>.
In python is not necessary create a constructor method <code>__init__</code> neither initialize these attributes.
But in your example if you call <code>functions2</code> before <code>function1</code> it will crash because you are using one attribute that doen't exist. Then is recommended initialize the attributes.
You can initialize the attributes like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Project:
    a = ''
    b = ''

    def function1(self):
        self.a='hello world,'

    def function2(self):
        self.b=self.a + ' I am alive'
</code></pre>
<p><strong>More things to keep in mind:</strong><br/>
1. The variables are in lower case and snake case: <code>project1 = Project()</code><br/>
2. Your prints won't print anything because your functions don't return anything. You have to return something like:</p>
<pre><code>def function1():
    return 'hello world,'
</code></pre>
<p>or if you need to set a and print:</p>
<pre><code>def function1():
    self.a = 'hello world,'
    return self.a
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you need is:</p>
<pre><code>    def function1(self):
      self.a = 'hello world, '
</code></pre>
<p>Within <code>function1</code>, <code>a</code> is a local variable as someone stated, whereas <code>self.a</code> is an attribute attached to your current object.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In <code>function1(self)</code> you need to change <code>a=</code> to <code>self.a=</code>. In your original code you were creating a local variable <code>a</code>, you need to explicitly use <code>self</code> to attach the variable <code>a</code> to the instance of the object and stay persistent across function calls.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">in <code>function1</code>, <code>a</code> is local. You probably wanted <code>self.a='hello world, '</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">so, if I want to have the printing of function2, I should define a in function1 as self.a?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. In your code as it is, <code>self.a</code> (attribute <code>a</code> of the object <code>self</code>) is never defined. <code>a</code> in <code>function1</code> is local variable. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Classes - Python Scopes and Namespaces</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks to everyone ;) now, it finally works</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and do I need to use <b>init</b>, or is not compulsory in a class?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It works the way it is. You only need <code>__init__</code> if you want to set <code>self.a</code> right after the object is created (instantiated).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">perfect...thank you for your help</span>
