<p>I'm running a Python script on my windows 10 machine. The script reads compressed data files, stored as .tar.gz, processes it, and then reads the next one. In this manner it processes thousands of files.</p>
<p>I run the scipt in a windows10 powershell, and -seemingly randomly- I often get the following error:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oqr9V.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="python_stopped_working" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oqr9V.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some times this happens after a day, sometimes already after a few minutes.
I select 'Close program' and the script is terminated. Looking into Windows event viewer, I can see the following entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faulting application name: python.exe, version: 3.6.2150.1013, time
  stamp: 0x59c1326e Faulting module name: multiarray.cp36-win_amd64.pyd,
  version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x59c3eeda Exception code: 0xc0000005</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any ideas on how to avoid this error message?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>0xc0000005 means 'memory access violation' error.
The related info seems to indicate this happens when python is processing arrays.</p>
<p>You can try to trouble shoot by adding logs so you can identify the issue.
The problem may be solved by changing related code.</p>
<p>If you are able to replicate the issue consistently and the python code seems correct - it may be a rare case of a bug in python.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should start it in environment where you can see the error (probably some exception)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you post the relevant part of the script?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm logging errors to a .txt file. There are none. Hence I also do not know at which line the script crashes...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would suggest running the script in the command prompt or PowerShell. There, you will be able to see where exactly the script runs into issues.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you have different versions of Python installed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">or of a bug in numpy actually...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thx. Very helpful. Any ideas on how I can find out where exactly multiarray.cp36-win_amd64.pyd is being used in my script?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Check if your code is using try except blocks. You can try to print stack trace report so you get some idea which line of your code led to the issue.
