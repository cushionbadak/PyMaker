<p>How can I use the value of a variable as the object in a class?</p>
<p>e.g. I have a class called 'a', and I want to be able to assign the value of a variable 'b' to be the name of an object in class a</p>
<pre><code>class a():
   __init__(self):

b = "foo"
</code></pre>
<p>How can I make it so that</p>
<pre><code>b = a()
</code></pre>
<p>Would be the same as</p>
<pre><code>foo = a()
</code></pre>
<p>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The recommended way of doing that kind of thing is to rather use a dictionnary. Like so :</p>
<pre><code>b = "foo"
myDictionnary = {}

myDictionnary[b] = a

print(myDictionnary["foo"])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you seek is unarguably a bad practice, but if you must...</p>
<p>This can only be done on the global scope. You'll need to add your new variable to the <code>globals()</code> dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>class a:
   pass

b = 'foo'

globals()[b] = a()

print foo
# &lt;__main__.a instance at 0x10282d518&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This also works inside functions:</p>
<pre><code>class a:
    pass

b = 'foo'

# Be careful with this. As I said, this updates the global scope
# So "foo" can actually be accessed out of the function.
# Furthermore, calling this function more than once will yield
# different results as globals()['foo'] keeps getting overriden
def some_method():
    globals()[b] = a()
    print foo
    # &lt;__main__.a instance at 0x10282d5a8&gt;

some_method()
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">.... what? I do not understand what you mean. <code>b = a()</code> is <i>the same</i> as <code>foo = a()</code>... do you mean <code>b = foo()</code>?</span>
