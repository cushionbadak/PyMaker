<p>I need to execute unix commands from my local in python. I can connect to the server and create files, however anytime I try to execute commands, I get no result on the server.</p>
<p>The path to the server is</p>
<pre><code>path = "M:\\dir1\\dir2"
</code></pre>
<p>where M is a mapped windows network drive.</p>
<p>I can use <code>fh</code> to create a file and write to it, but then I need to change the permissions to executable and execute it in another call.</p>
<p>How can I do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using <code>os.chmod</code> as seen here <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chmod" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.chmod</a> to change permissions</p>
<p>To execute you can use 
<code>subprocess.Popen(["executable_file"],  stdout=subprocess.PIPE)</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">what about the further execution? Will sub.call work then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean further execution?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need to execute the file that I've changed the file on. This will launch a job on the unix machine and create file output that python from my local will retrieve once finished.</span>
