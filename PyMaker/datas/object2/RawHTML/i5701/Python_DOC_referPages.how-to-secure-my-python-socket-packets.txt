<p>A good way to go would be to use OpenSSL to wrap your packets in SSL (<code>Secure Socket Layer</code>, it is the protocol used to secure the connection in HTTPS).</p>
<p>The pyOpenSSL repository has an <a href="https://github.com/msabramo/pyOpenSSL/tree/master/examples/simple" rel="nofollow noreferrer">example project</a> you can use to build your application.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What exactly is the client and server doing? Can you not use use https as your interface between the client and server?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is far too broad for a SO question. You should read (again?) <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One alternative is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">[Python]: <i>ssl</i> â€” TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects</a> module that comes with <i>Python</i> by default. It wraps the regular sockets, offering same interface.</span>
