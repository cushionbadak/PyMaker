<p>I am learning python. I am using python 3.6</p>
<pre><code>reObject = re.compile(r'(ab*)')

print (mo1.group())

<p>The above code matches only <code>a</code> in 'name' instead of <code>abbb</code></p>
<p>However the below code matches properly.</p>

<p>How to match a string if the alphabet appears before in the searched string?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.rexegg.com/regex-quickstart.html</a> is a good resource for regex</p>
<p>the * character means find 0 or more
this will find a with 0 b's</p>
<p>the + character means find 1 or more</p>
<p>so (ab+) will find abbb</p>

  Causes the resulting RE to match <strong>0 or more</strong> repetitions of the preceding RE, as many repetitions as are possible. <strong>ab* will match ‘a’, ‘ab’, or ‘a’ followed by any number of ‘b’s</strong>.</p>

  Causes the resulting RE to match <strong>1 or more repetitions</strong> of the preceding RE. a<strong>b+ will match ‘a’ followed by any non-zero number of ‘b’s</strong>; it will not match just ‘a’.</p>

<p>If you are concerned about why <code>ab*</code> is only matching the first <code>a</code>, it technically doesn't. The issue is with how you are using the pattern:
 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.search</code></a> only scans for the first match. If you want to find all matches, look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.findall</code></a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You want it to match <code>a</code> followed by 1 or more <code>b</code>s?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could use the pattern <code>r'(ab*).*(ab*)'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's really unclear what you want. Do you actually want to match a different expression? Or do you want to find all the matches? Or do you only want to find the last match? Often, the real answer is "the regex doesn't do what I hope it would" for which the first step towards a solution is to properly explain what you hope.</span>
