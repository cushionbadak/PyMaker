<p>This is what I did during my free time, but for some reason whenever I try this code, I get everything. The goal for it is to pick a random number from 1 to 6. 
Instead, this is what I get</p>
<pre><code>number = 1,2,3,4,5,6

import random

for i in range(20):
    question= raw_input("Do you want a number from 1 to 6")
    if question == "yes":
        print number
    elif question == "no":
        print "Ok"

<p>The value of <code>number</code> is the tuple <code>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)</code>, so this is working as expected. 
If you want to select a random number from that set, you might try using the <code>random.sample</code> function</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>import random
result = random.sample(numbers, 1)    
print result  # will produce one number from the set
</code></pre>
<p>or, if you know that you're always going to be using a selection from a contiguous range, you can use <code>randint</code></p>

<p>What you are looking for is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.choice</code></a>.</p>
<p>Sample code :</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; number = [1,2,3,4,5]

&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(3): 
        print(random.choice(number)) 
=&gt;  5
    4
    2
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>From python docs :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>random.choice(seq)</strong></p>
<p>Return a random element from the non-empty sequence
  seq. If seq is empty, raises IndexError.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>As for the problem in your code, you are not getting any randomly generated numbers or selecting from the <code>tuple</code>, but are rather just printing the whole <code>tuple</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes it's wrong in your code you just printing list of ints. To get a random number you need to use <code>random.randint</code> function like:</p>
<pre><code>import random
for i in range(20):
    question= raw_input("Do you want a number from 1 to 6")
    if question == "yes":
        print random.randint(1, 6)
    elif question == "no":
        print "Ok"`

<span class="comment-copy">what is the problem you're trying to solve? what is the question you're trying to answer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try to be more specific with your question title</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What did you expect <code>print number</code> to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You think they want the number in a list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">only because that's how the OP specified the problem originally :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I checked the revision history and can't find anything that says so...</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>number = 1,2,3,4,5,6</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">First of all, that's not a list but a tuple, and secondly, I'm talking about "the number" they "want". As in, the <i>output</i>. Your output is one number in a list.</span>
