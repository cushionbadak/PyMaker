<p>I 'm trying to get lines from an sqlite database that contain a certain word in 'A1' column and another in 'A2' column. My code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>a = input("Please insert word")
b = input("Please insert second word")
  ....
c.execute("SELECT * FROM board WHERE A1 LIKE ?" ("%" + a + "%",), "AND A2 LIKE ?" ("%" + b + "%",))
</code></pre>
<p>I 'm getting a TypeError: 'str' object is not callable. I am pretty sure my syntax is wrong but i cannot figure out how the correct one should be. Any help?</p>
</div>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.execute" rel="nofollow noreferrer">execute() method</a> expects two parameters: a single SQL statement string, and a list containing the SQL parameters:</p>
<pre><code>c.execute("SELECT * FROM board WHERE A1 LIKE ? AND A2 LIKE ?",
          ("%" + a + "%", "%" + b + "%"))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's the last line. Should be something like this</p>
<pre><code>c.execute("SELECT * FROM board WHERE A1 LIKE ? % {} % AND A2 LIKE ? % {} %".format(a,b))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">That worked for me, thank you very much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It gives me error sqlite3.OperationalError: near "AND": syntax error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure that's proper sqlite syntax?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's your answer so are YOU sure that's a proper sqlite syntax?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just corrected the python syntax, the rest is on you</span>
