<p>In Python, <code>True != True</code> is <code>False</code>, and <code>False != True</code> should be <code>True</code>. However, shouldn't the result of the evaluation then be <code>True</code>, as well?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is because the two checks are preformed independently. <code>True != True != True</code> is equivalent to <code>True != True and True != True</code>, which evaluates to <code>False</code>, as neither of the operands evaluates to <code>True</code> (in fact, it doesn't even evaluate the second <code>True != True</code> comparison, due to short-circuiting).</p>
<p>The relevant <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., <code>x &lt; y &lt;= z</code> is equivalent to <code>x &lt; y and y &lt;= z</code>, except that <code>y</code> is evaluated only once (but in both cases <code>z</code> is not evaluated at all when <code>x &lt; y</code> is found to be false).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I executed this: print (True != True) print (False != True).And the output I got is False True. I dont get what exactly is your doubt here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The doubt comes from thinking that the conditions are evaluated sequentially and cumulatively, like an arithmetic operation. Instead, this is actually a chain of single, simultaneous checks (chained by an <code>and</code> operation).</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Why is this tagged <code>perl</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sobrique I was wondering about that, myself, so I submitted an edit to have this tag removed. That edit just got accepted, so now that tag is removed</span>
