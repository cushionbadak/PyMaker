<p>I'm sorry if this question seems basic. I'm very new at this (this is my first semester with Python) and I just want to understand what I'm doing wrong. People have already called me "lazy" for not understanding the concept, but I don't, I have no one else to ask, and I just want to learn.</p>
<p>I have a program:</p>
<pre><code>def num4():
    def tp(nums):
        res = []
        for i in  range(len(nums)):
            for j in  range(i+1,len(nums)):
                res.append(nums[i] + nums[j])
        return  res

    nums = [ 1, 5, 7, -2 ]
    print(tp(nums)
</code></pre>
<p>I walked through what it does, marked it up, and expected it to produce this result:</p>
<pre><code>def tp(nums):
    res = []

    for i in  range(len(nums)): 
    # startvalue = len(nums), stopvalue = 0, inc = 1

        for j in  range(i+1,len(nums)): 
    # startvalue = i + 1, stopvalue = len(nums) - 1, inc = 1

            res.append(nums[i] + nums[j])

    return  res

    nums = [ 1, 5, 7, -2 ]
    print(tp(nums))


for i in range(4):
# range(4) = 1, 2, 3, 4

    i = 1:
    for j in range(i + 1, 4):
    # range(1 + 1, 4) = 2, 3
    res = [nums[1] + nums[2]] = 5 + 7 = 12
    res = [nums[1] + nums[3]] = 5 - 2 = 3

    i = 2:
    for j in range(i + 1, 4):
    # range(2+1, 4) = 3
    res = [nums[2] + nums[3]] = 7 - 2 = 5

    i = 3:
    for j in range(i + 1, 4):
    # range(3+1, 4) = n/a
    res = [nums[3] + n/a] = -2

    i = 4
    for j in range(i + 1, 4):
    # range(4+1, 4) = n/a
    res = [nums[4] + n/a] = 1
</code></pre>
<p><strong>PREDICTED OUTPUT</strong>: res = [ 12, 3, 5, -2, 1 ]</p>
<p>Instead, when I did this in a Python interactive session:</p>
<pre><code>from ExamCheck1 import num4
num4()
</code></pre>
<p>It produced this output:
<code>[6, 8, -1, 12, 3, 5]</code></p>
<p>I got the <code>12, 3, 5</code> right, but where did the <code>6, 8, -1</code> part come from? I'm very lost and confused.</p>
<p>Please help. </p>
<p>If you don't want to answer because you think I'm being lazy, please just don't answer; I don't need to be told (again) how lazy I am for not understanding what I'm doing wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>The values you expect from the range function are a bit flawed. There are three possible ways you can use the range function:</p>
<ol>
<li>range(x): Generates an array with values from 0 ~ x-1. So range(4) = [0,1,2,3]</li>
<li>range(x,y): Generates values from x ~ y-1. So range(1,4) = [1,2,3]</li>
<li>range(x,y,z): Generating values from x~y-1 in steps of z. So range(1,10,2) = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]</li>
</ol>
<p>Walk through your code with these values of range and it will make sense to you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code># range(4) = 1, 2, 3, 4</code> --- Try <code>list(range(4))</code> in the interpreter to see what <code>range(4)</code> <i>really</i> does.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Solid answer. For completeness, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation link</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked, and I finally understand! Thank you so much! @SaravanaKumar</span>
