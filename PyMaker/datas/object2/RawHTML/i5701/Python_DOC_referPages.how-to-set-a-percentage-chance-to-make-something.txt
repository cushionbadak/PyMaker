<p>I making a fighting game. Its like there are two players. They have 100 hp and they choose attack value btween 0-100 when they're fighting. After they choose value they should have %(100-value) chance of being successful with this attack. For example if they choose value 60, they have %40 chance to be successful with this attack.Can you please help. Sorry for my bad english.</p>

<p>What you want is to generate a random number between <code>0</code> and <code>100</code> and check if it's greater than your inserted number.</p>
<p>For example, if you enter 50, there's a 50% chance the random number will be greater (or equal), 50% lower. If you enter 10, there's a 90% chance the number will be greater.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html#random.randrange" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.randrange(101)</code></a> to generate a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive. Then it's a simple comparison to your value, and that should be all you need.</p>

<p>Generally, in statistics, a chance is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, so 0.6 represents a 60% chance. Then, if you want to have a 0.6 chance of success, you can determine success or not by picking a random floating point number between 0 and 1 and check if it is smaller than or equal to 0.6.</p>
<p>Intuitively, you can look at it this way:</p>
<pre><code>|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
0                                  0.6                      1
</code></pre>
<p>If you'd pick a random point on this line—your random number between 0 and 1—the chance of it being on the left side of the 0.6 is... 0.6 (60%).</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html#random.uniform" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.uniform</code></a> for this:</p>
<pre><code>import random
success_rate_percentage = 60
success = random.uniform(0, 1) &lt;= success_rate_percentage / 100.0
</code></pre>
<p>Now as a simple check if this is functioning properly:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; success_count = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; for _ in range(100000):
...     if random.uniform(0, 1) &lt;= 0.6
...         success_count += 1
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; success_count
59954
</code></pre>
<p>The expected result is about 0.6 * 100000 = 60000 successes and the actual result is 59954, so that's close enough.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So if they choose <code>0</code>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you don't want to have them choose, no? Maybe you want to choose for them? So <code>import random; print random.random() * 100</code>. Even better <code>import random; print random.randint(1, 100)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So your question is, "how does the <code>random</code> module work"? That's too much to answer in one question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd suggest you try your best to do what you need and come back when you have some specific question. You can take the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random</a> module and run it through a translator, which will help you understand the module in a general sense.</span>
