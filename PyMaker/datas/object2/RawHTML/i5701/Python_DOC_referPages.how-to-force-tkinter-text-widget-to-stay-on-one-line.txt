<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to create an object akin to Label, however I want it to also be selectable for copy-pasting. I have done so using the Text widget:</p>
<pre><code>class CopyLabel (Text):
    def __init__ (self, master, text = '', font = None):
        if font is None:
            super().__init__(master = master, height = 1,
                             borderwidth = 0, width = len(text),
                             bg = master['background'])
        else:
            super().__init__(master = master, height = 1,
                             borderwidth = 0, font = font,
                             width = len(text), bg = master['background'])
        self.insert(1.0, text)
        self.configure(state = 'disabled')
</code></pre>
<p>I end up displaying this widget with a grid. However, I randomly find the last 1 or 2 characters not showing. When investigating this, it seems the Text widget is splitting those characters off to a new line (when selecting the text, it is possible to drag down to see this second line). The biggest problem is the unpredictable nature of this splitting (I tried doing width = len(text) + 2, but I still occasionally get this line splitting behaviour). Is there any way to remedy this behaviour?</p>
<p>EDIT: setting wrap = 'none' fixed the line splitting behaviour, but the text is still getting cutoff. Now I have to scroll horizontally instead of vertically to see the text, but I guess that is a different question from what I posed.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you're experiencing is called <em>wrapping</em> and can be disabled modifying Text widget's <code>wrap</code> option, as in :</p>
<pre><code>self['wrap'] = 'none'
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>self.config(wrap='none')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">maybe <a href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/text.htm#Tkinter.Text.config-method" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wrap="none"</a> - <code>tk.Text(root, wrap='none')</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you have to use <a href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/scrollbar.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Scrollbar</a> to scroll it. Or use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.scrolledtext.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ttk.scrolledtext</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">correction:  ttk.scrolledtext has only vertical scrollbar so you have to use <code>Scrollbar</code> with <code>Text</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If it's one line, why not use an Entry widget? It's specifically designed one single line input.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, I just realized what was causing the problem. I was changing the font for the text. Since not all fonts are the same width, it has been cutting off some texts. The CopyLabel widget works as intended if the font is unchanged.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That fixed the wrapping, but now my displayed texts are getting cutoff instead. Anyway to fix that without making the Text width larger than it needs to be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could use a scrollbar widget, or write a much more complex method to dynamically resize the widget based on its content. That's a separate question and should be researched based on what behavior you want and if you can't find a solution, then you should ask in SO.</span>
