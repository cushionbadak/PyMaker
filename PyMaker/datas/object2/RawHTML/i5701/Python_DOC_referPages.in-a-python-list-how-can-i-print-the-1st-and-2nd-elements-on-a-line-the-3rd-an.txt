<p>I am generating a string and appending it to a list. I am looping that action to make a list of 40 elements. I want to print them like so:</p>
<p>here's my list</p>
<pre><code>list = [ 'first', 'second', 'third', ... 'fortieth' ]
</code></pre>
<p>i tried this</p>
<pre><code>for z in list:
if z % 2 == 0:
    print(list[z], list[z+1])
</code></pre>
<p>and many other variations. i want it to print like this</p>
<pre><code>first second
third fourth
fifth sixth
...
thirty-ninth fortieth
</code></pre>
<p>how can i do this?
thank you for your time</p>

<p>Printing 2 values on a list is as simple as creating a for loop that skips over every other value. When you create a for loop, you can use <code>range(start,stop,interval)</code> to accomplish this. Then you can just fill in the two print statements using the for loop</p>
<p>I hope that this will work for you:</p>
<pre><code>for x in range(0,len(listtest),2):
    print (listtest[x], listtest[x+1])
</code></pre>
<p>replace <code>testlist</code> with your list's name</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Firstly, you shouldn't be using <code>list</code> as a variable name, as its already a built-in function. </p>
<p>Secondly you can get every <em>odd</em> indexed item by slicing <code>[::2]</code>, and every <em>even</em> indexed item with [<code>1::2]</code>, which is show below:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_list = ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'sixth']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(my_list[::2])
['first', 'third', 'fifth']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(my_list[1::2])
['second', 'fourth', 'sixth']
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can just <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip()</code></a> the lists together and print them: </p>
<pre><code>my_list = ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'sixth']

for x, y in zip(my_list[::2], my_list[1::2]):
    print(x, y)
</code></pre>
<p>Which outputs:</p>
<pre><code>first second
third fourth
fifth sixth
</code></pre>

<p>this is pretty straightforward.  you write a for loop.  go through the list.  for every odd number--if line number mod 2 == 1; then, print a newline.  print("\n")</p>
<p>unless there is something special about the list that you aren't telling us.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to write a loop and iterate the list.
Since you have 40 elements it's easy</p>
<pre><code>i=0
while(i&lt;40):
    print(list[i]," ",list[i+1])
    i=i+2
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">seriously? downvote? how is this not clear enough? i will add some extremely obvious code for your satisfaction. of course i have tried things. why would i be asking if i hadn't tried things? do you think this is the kind of feedback i was looking for?  why not just say nothing since you obviously don't know how to answer my question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The down vote is not mine and the rest of your assumptions is also wrong. Have a nice day.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow, @grcHIDDEN, responding like that isn't a great way to get help from strangers. "i will add some extremely obvious code for your satisfaction". You add the code <b>so we can see what you've done</b> and so we can point out <b>what changes you could make</b> without having to write the entire thing <b>for you</b>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you for your clear answer i appreciate your time</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also great answer thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This terrible practice, but also hilarious. Not sure who downvoted you since it works</span>
