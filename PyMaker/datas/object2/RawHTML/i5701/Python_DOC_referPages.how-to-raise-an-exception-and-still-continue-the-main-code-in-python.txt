<p>Given the following simple example:</p>
<pre><code>while True:

    readme = input("Write here something:")

    if readme == "":

        raise Exception("That was empty!")
</code></pre>
<p>(1) How can the main code / loop continue to work after an Exception has been thrown?  (2) And if we simultaneously run another thread, how can we catch the Exception in there?</p>
<p>Edit: is it possible to do this without having a try/except block inside the loop?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes it is possible with try/except.</p>
<p>Try making a function like so:</p>
<pre><code>from inspect import currentframe,getframeinfo
def Raise(ex):

    cf = currentframe()
    #Get the line
    line=cf.f_back.f_lineno
    print('Traceback:\n'+ex+'\nin line '+str(line))
    wait=input('Press Enter to continue excecution.')
</code></pre>
<p>And then call:</p>
<pre><code>myexception('That was empty!)
</code></pre>
<p>For example (from the example):</p>
<pre><code>from inspect import currentframe,getframeinfo

    def Raise(ex):
    cf = currentframe()
    #Get the line
    line=cf.f_back.f_lineno
    print('Traceback:\n'+ex+'\nin line '+str(line))
    wait=input('Press Enter to continue excecution.')

readme = input("Write here something:")
if readme == "":
    Raise("That was empty!")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Without using the try/catch it is not possible in python. When we call a function in python and it raises a exception, the exceptions is propagated to the caller function and it continues.    </p>
<p>If you do not handle the the exception anywhere in the above chain, interpreter just throw it out to the user.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you want your code to continue after an exception was thrown, you need to catch the exception. Go read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I realized I may have to update my question. In the loop, I do not wish to use a try / except block. Is it possible to work around that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please see also part (2) of the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want to raise an exception, not catch it, and have your code continue anway? I'm not sure what your asking for makes any sense.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is more of a theoretical question than a practical one, hence the simplification of the code. I would be interested to know if that is possible to do. I put the question in 2 parts, so you would understand better what I am after. Please read further than just question 1...</span>
