<p>Today stumbled upon Literal String Interpolation, </p>
<pre><code>a=4
b=5
f'{a+b}'
</code></pre>
<p>the above code gives the output 9,
I was trying to put the operation in variable too.</p>
<pre><code>a=4
b='+'
c=5
</code></pre>
<p>Now how can Literal String Interpolation generate the expected output, saw the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/#how-to-denote-f-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> but could not make much out of it.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>eval()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>r = eval(f'{a}{b}{c}')
</code></pre>
<p><strong>However</strong>, use of <code>eval()</code> is usually not recommended, since it will evaluate any string you feed to it. That includes arbitrary code a malicious user might have put in there somehow. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi,  many thanks for the downvote, kindly let me know what was it downvoted for or it was just for testing whether down vote works or not :p</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't need the <code>+</code>, <code>eval(f"{a}{b}{c}")</code> will work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@stybl, yup did see another post on stackoverflow that eval is evil, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2371436/evaluating-a-mathematical-expression-in-a-string" title="evaluating a mathematical expression in a string">stackoverflow.com/questions/2371436/â€¦</a></span>
