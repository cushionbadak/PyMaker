<p>I am using glob to list out all my python files in the home directory by this line of code.
I want to find all .json files too along with py files, but I couldn't found any to scan for multiple file types in one line code. </p>
<pre><code>for file in glob.glob('/home/mohan/**/*.py', recursive=True):
    print(file)
</code></pre>

<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.walk</a>, which looks in subdirectories as well.</p>
<pre><code>import os

for root, dirs, files in os.walk("path/to/directory"):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith((".py", ".json")): # The arg can be a tuple of suffixes to look for
            print(os.path.join(root, file))

<span class="comment-copy">I've closed this as dupe of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4568580/python-glob-multiple-filetypes" title="python glob multiple filetypes">stackoverflow.com/questions/4568580/â€¦</a>, but reopened. I think you should avoid glob in that case because it will scan directories more than once. Better compute the list of files and check patterns.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>os.walk()</code> and filter on a filename-by-filename basis. <code>glob.glob()</code> does not support multiple patterns.</span>
