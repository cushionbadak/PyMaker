<p><strong>Note</strong>:
I can't use third party modules so bs4 and lxml are not an option.<br/></p>
<p>I need to parse HTML with the 
Python 3 std lib. I thought xml.minidom would be the way to go but it doesn't seem to be able to parse invalid XML/HTML without throwing an exception like syntax error.<br/><br/>
Am I missing something within the xml module that can do what I'm looking for?<br/>
<br/>
Am I missing something in the std lib?</p>

<p>Assuming that not being able to use third-party modules is justified, you have a better chance with  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>html.parser</code></a>, which should give you a more low-level control over the parsing process.</p>
<p><code>xml.dom.minidom</code>, I am afraid, generally, is not going to be able to parse a broken document.</p>

<p>if you need to handle broken html/xml, I recommend you to ckech Beautiful Soup 4</p>

<span class="comment-copy">As I said I can't use bs4 or any other third party module</span>
