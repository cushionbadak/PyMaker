<p>I was wondering if there is a C++ "map"-like thing in Python. For example if I have 10^9 items and each one needs to hold one value: True or False (only the "True"-values are meaningful, but in order to check fast and not in O(n^2)), my code is very inefficient:</p>
<pre><code>for k in range(0, numberOfItems):
myList.append([False])
</code></pre>
<p>I can check the value is True or False, but with larger numbers, like 10^9, I get a runtime error because of the list size. It just can't hold that many items. Any help would be appreciated, thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Sure that exist you can use dictionary ! <br/>
See docs for more informations over how it works : <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link to python documentation over dictionary</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Python's dictionaries are like C++ maps.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use a dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you appending <code>[False]</code> instead of just <code>False</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Although if you can't make a list of 10^9 items, you probably wouldn't be able to create a dict, either.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Barmar yeah, since this map simply holds a value of true or false, then you could just check membership in a <code>set</code> anyways.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should give an example (not shown at first posting this type of question) and not just a referal. Please improve your answer.</span>
