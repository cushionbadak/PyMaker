<p>I tried this,</p>
<pre><code>pip install memoize
Requirement already satisfied: memoize
</code></pre>
<p>But every time i run pytest, I get the above error 
<code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'memoize'</code>
and it fails to load the <code>conftest.py</code> file even though it is in my tests folder and it also contains an <code>__init__.py</code> file.</p>
<p>any suggestions what else could be wrong/missing? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The python path could be the issue </p>
<p><code>python -m pytest projectroot</code>/</p>
<p>To fix this you could also set the path using</p>
<pre><code>import sys, os
myPath = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) 
sys.path.insert(0, myPath + '/../')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Could be because of the python path issue have you tried <i>python -m pytest projectrootdir/</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked. Thanks @NareshKumar</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what does the -m stand for? I have issues with pylint as well...<code>unable to import memoize (import-error)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can check <code>python --help</code> for more details on arguments. The issue is with the path variables you might be having different version python/modules and your root project folder is not in the <code>sys.path</code> for python to process it correctly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The above command helped pytest work. but linter raises this <code>Unable to import 'memoize' (import-error)</code> any idea how to avoid this. I tried uninstalling the global version, and installing <code>memoize</code> again. didn't help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you provide your project tree structure? You can also check the following doc <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PYTHONPATH</a> .
