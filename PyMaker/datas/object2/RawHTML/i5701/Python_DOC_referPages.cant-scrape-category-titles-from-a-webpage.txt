<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've written a scraper in python to get different category names from a webpage but it is unable to fetch anything from that page. I'm seriously confused not to be able to figure out where i'm going wrong. Any help would be vastly appreciated.</p>
<p>Here is the link to the webpage: <a href="https://www.therange.co.uk/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">URL</a></p>
<p>Here is what I've tried so far:</p>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

res = requests.get("replace_with_above_url",headers={"User-Agent":"Mozilla/5.0"})
soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text,"lxml")
for items in soup.select('.slide_container .h3.standardTitle'):
    print(items.text)
</code></pre>
<p>Elements within which one such category names I'm after:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="slide_container"&gt;
    &lt;a href="/offers/furniture/" tabindex="0"&gt;
        &lt;picture style="float: left; width: 100%;"&gt;&lt;img style="width:100%" src="/_m4/9/8/1513184943_4413.jpg" data-w="270"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
        &lt;div class="floated-details inverted" style="height: 69px;"&gt;
            &lt;div class="h3 margin-top-sm margin-bottom-sm standardTitle"&gt;
                Furniture Offers                         #This is the name I'm after
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="carouselDesc"&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

headers = {
    'accept':'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8',

</code></pre>
<p>Try this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a user-agent is not enough because headers are the most important part
  of scrapping.if you miss any header then server ll treat you as a bot.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>"html.parser"</code></a> instead of <code>"lxml"</code></p>
<pre><code>soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text,"html.parser")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">are you getting the right html in res.text?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seem that server doesn't want you to scrape the data :) Your request returns you not the page you actually see in your browser, but block-page with the following content <code>"As you were browsing www.therange.co.uk something about your browser made us think you were a bot. There are a few reasons this might happen..."</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tried with selenium but the end result is as you have mentioned @sir Andersson.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One more thing: as you are getting the same response what I'm getting so the blocking process is not meant to my IP address only;rather, it is applicable for all.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For me it works fine with Selenium... Did you try Headless PhantomJS browser?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are just awesome @Tailor Devendra. Your solution worked finally. Gonna accept it  in a  while. I would like to know something though. You skipped few parameters along with cookies to add to the headers according to what i can see in the devtools. Moreover, you have added an extra parameter <code>referer</code> in the header. Could you please tell my why so that i can take into consideration in future. Thanks. Again, your solution did the trick flawlessly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How come this answer solves the issue?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I assumed the variable<code>res.text</code> contains the above html and calculated further. Can you paste the html you are getting in <code>res.text</code>?</span>
