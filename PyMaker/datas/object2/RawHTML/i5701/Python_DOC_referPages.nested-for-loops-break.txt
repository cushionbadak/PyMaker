<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This seems quite simple but I can't get it to work. I'm using <strong>Python 3</strong>.</p>
<p>I have a nested for loop</p>
<pre><code>for x in list:
    ch_id_dic[i]='channel_id'
    ch_id_dic2= dict((v,k) for k,v in ch_id_dic.items())
    for y in list_2:
        ch_id_dic[j]='description'
        ch_id_dic2= dict((v,k) for k,v in ch_id_dic.items())
        break
</code></pre>
<p>After the break statment it goes through the second element of list but then in the nested for loop it goes to the first element again. I want it to go to the second.</p>
<p>Can someone please help me?</p>
<p>Thanks...</p>

<h2>Use <code>zip</code>.</h2>
<p>You need to iterate through both lists at the same time. The <code>zip(list1,list2)</code> function takes two lists of equal size and turns them into a single list by doing something like <code>[(list1[index],list2[index]) for index in range(len(list1))]</code>. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>break</code> statements end the current loop. In your case, as you noticed, it stops the nested loop and continues with the next iteration of the external loop.</p>
<p>It sounds like you are trying to keep the index of the outer loop to match the inner, so track the index of the outer loop with the <code>enumerate</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>for idx, x in enuerate(list):
    ch_id_dic[i] = 'channel_id'
    ch_id_dic2 = dict((v,k) for k,v in ch_id_dic.items())
    for y in range(idx, len(list_2)):
        ch_id_dic[j] = 'description'
        ch_id_dic2 = dict((v,k) for k,v in ch_id_dic.items())
        break
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to use the old value of y at some point, just use <code>list_2[y]</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It sounds like you want to iterate through both lists in lockstep.  Maybe using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> function: <code>for x, y in zip(list1, list2)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, I see. Didn't notice that the flag automatically made a comment. Thanks for feedback, Patrick.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using the zip function worked! Thanks!</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@BearBrown, if I understand it correctly, the goal is not to break out of both loops..</span>
