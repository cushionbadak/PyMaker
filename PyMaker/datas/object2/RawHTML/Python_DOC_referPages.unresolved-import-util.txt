<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Extensive searching on Google, Reddit, and this site was fruitless, so hopefully someone here can help me out. The code</p>
<pre><code>import util
</code></pre>
<p>gives the error <code>unresolved import 'util'</code>. <code>util.py</code> is a module in the same folder. For reference, here is my hierarchy:</p>
<pre><code>\Projects
    |-\adventure
        |-\src
            |-__init__.py
            |-main.py
            |-util.py
</code></pre>
<p>and this is my VSCode's info:</p>
<pre><code>Version: 1.32.2 (user setup)

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>What I believe is happening is that VSCode is running the <code>main.py</code> from a current working directory that is not <code>/Projects</code> or any of its sub directories. So when you try to <code>import util</code> or <code>from adventure import util</code>, it cannot find the file. A quick and easy fix would be to append the path to <code>/src</code> to the <code>sys.path</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append('/Projects/adventure/src')
import util
</code></pre>
<p>or whatever the <em>absolute path</em> to <code>/src</code> may be. A bit cleaner might be to append your <code>/Projects</code> directory, and then import from adventure, so that you don't have to append extra directories if you want to include modules from other packages in your Projects folder.</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append('/Projects') # whatever the absolute path to /Projects is
from adventure import util
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Another possibility involves updating the VSCode configuration file to specify a modified <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable, to specify the path to import the project from. You can either include the following in the <code>launch.json</code> under your configuration:</p>
<pre><code>"env": {
    "PYTHONPATH": "/path/to/src/:${PYTHONPATH}"
}
</code></pre>
<p>or create an <code>.env</code> file to specify the same:</p>
<pre><code>PYTHONPATH=/path/to/src/:${PYTHONPATH}
</code></pre>
<p>These were obtained from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_environment-variable-definitions-file" rel="nofollow noreferrer">visualstudio docs</a>. Note that you may have to change <code>:</code> to <code>;</code> and <code>/</code> to <code>\\</code> on windows.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>from adventure import util</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>from adventure.src import util</code>? :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>import .util</code> most likely.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Those all then get the <code>unresolved import</code> error, unfortunately.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"unresolved import" isn't a Python error. What's throwing that error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That didn't work, unfortunately. Could it have something to do with the location of <code>python.exe</code>? I installed it into my <code>/Documents</code> folder, and the <code>/Projects</code> folder is located inside the same folder as all of the installation files (<code>/Python</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DCoded it shouldn't really. I do have another idea though- I'll update my post</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DCoded just to be sure, you did write your absolute path using <code>\\ instead of /</code> in the first attempt right? Since you're on windows, you're path delimiters are double backslashes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I tried using both <code>\\ and /</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Creating the <code>.env</code> file with the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> specified seems to have worked, although I didn't include the <code>:${PYTHONPATH}</code> at the end. Thank you.</span>
