<p>I'm using Spyder 3.2.4 (Python 3.6). Spyder doesn't detect changes in imported python files. For example:</p>
<p><em>test2.py:</em></p>
<pre><code>def func():
    return 5
</code></pre>
<p><em>test1.py:</em></p>
<pre><code>import test2

a = test2.func()
print(a)
</code></pre>
<p>When I wrote those classes, and saved them (in the same working directory), and ran <em>test1.py</em> the output was <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>BUT when I change the function in <em>test2.py</em>, to like:</p>
<pre><code>def func():
    return 10
</code></pre>
<p>Save it, and then run <em>python1.py</em>, I still get <code>5</code>. Only when I save, exit the IDE, and return, I will get the changed code (<code>10</code>). </p>
<p>This behavior is going on since I started using Spyder (few months by now), and it's super annoying. Help would be appreciated. </p>

<p>What you are experiencing is a Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#the-module-cache" rel="nofollow noreferrer">feature</a>. Modules are initialized when first imported and kept in a cache. Each subsequent import uses the cache, so the module code is not run again.</p>
<p>What in most cases is an eminently reasonable economy, is rather annoying when developing. You can force python to reload a module using <code>importlib.reload</code>.</p>

<p>(<em>Spyder maintainer here</em>) This is a <a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/5877" rel="nofollow noreferrer">know issue</a> and it'll fixed in our <strong>3.2.5</strong> version, to be released on December/2017.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Not sure this is spyder related. You could try and use <code>importlib.reload</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I'm using Intellij IDE with the python plugin it doesn't happen, so I'm pretty sure it is Spyder related.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What I meant is that this is a python feature. If you import a module, change it in the background and then import again python will not pick up the changes. You either have to restart the interpreter or you can use <code>importlib.reload</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">wow thanks. It works now. I didn't know about it. In intellij it happens automatically? answer as an answer to the question, so I'll be able to accept it.</span>
