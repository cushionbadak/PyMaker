<p>I am trying to capture the <code>starttime</code>, <code>stoptime</code>, <code>tripduration</code>, <code>from_station_id</code>, <code>to_station_id</code>, <code>gender</code>, <code>birthyear</code> from the following data.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>I just want to be able to have the regex identify these items from the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you really really really want a regex then you can use the following one:</p>
<pre><code>([^,]*)(?=,|$)
</code></pre>

<p>Good luck and let me know if you need some explanations.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you are using <code>csv</code> there is no need for regex to solve this problem as the data is comma separated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the source of the data? Is it in a file, a string, or what?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is in a .csv file. I have to only select those values and extract those values from each of the rows that meet the conditions that were given.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code> module</a> in the standard library is the best way to read CSV files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It must be written using regex, its a requirement.</span>
