<p>Is there a way to actually take a <strong><em>well formatted</em></strong> input and execute it at an appropriate time?</p>
<p>Something like:</p>
<pre><code>num = 5
command = input()
# do something with command
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if i enter <code>"print(num)"</code> as input, it should output </p>
<pre><code>5
</code></pre>
<p>And not just python, I would love to have solution to this problem in C, C++ or Java as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you suggest actually works as is:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x=1
&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(input())
print(x)
1
</code></pre>
<p>Another method you can have a look at is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">exec</a> method (and above that is a detailed description for eval).</p>
<p>Depending on what you are going for this might be a bad idea though. Have a look at the <code>local</code> and <code>global</code> parameters to restrict the environment.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The input to <code>eval</code> or <code>exec</code> has to be not only formatted correctly, it <b>must</b> come from a trusted source. <code>eval</code> and <code>exec</code> should generally be avoided because they can be a security risk. For details, please see <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Eval really is dangerous</a> by SO veteran Ned Batchelder. Also note that  <code>eval</code> / <code>exec</code> are <i>slow</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"a well formatted input" is not a sensible presumption in the real world. Treat every input as bad, unless you can show it is good.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Excellent link,  PM 2Ring. Exactly what I was looking for. It not only answered my question, not only stated the risks, but also gave me ideas to avoid such risks. Thanks again!</span>
