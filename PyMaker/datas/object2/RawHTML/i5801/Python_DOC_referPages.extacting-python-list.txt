<p>I have a pandas data frame which has strings in it like this </p>
<pre><code>ID value
1  2
2  25,35
3  1,25,3,40
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to count the number of times each value occurs.
The values are strings not integers or floats</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try this, using string ascessor, <code>split</code>, <code>stack</code> and <code>value_counts</code>:</p>
<pre><code>df.value.str.split(',', expand=True).stack().value_counts()
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>25    2
2     1
1     1
3     1
35    1
40    1
dtype: int64
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Pass all the values to a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Counter</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>counter = Counter()
for value in values:
     counter[value] += 1

<span class="comment-copy">@MaxU.... something about "great minds.." :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I refrained from posting this answer although I had it almost 4 minutes ago... seeing the downvotes pile up on this question. I was afraid people were white knighting it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's that badge for the turnaround? "Reverseal" Oh forgot it.  20 upvotes. :)   Not enough of a Pandas audience these days.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Someone please tell me. Why do people down vote.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@pythonninja: they often down-vote questions that show no evidence of prior effort from the original poster. Did you show your own code attempt in your question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No I didnt know..I am new so from now on I will.</span>
