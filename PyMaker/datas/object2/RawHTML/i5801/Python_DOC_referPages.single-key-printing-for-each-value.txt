<p>I am using python to run a for loop to print out every value in a specific URL, but each value is printing to a new dictionary with the same key instead of inserting multiple values into one dictionary.</p>
<p>How can I get the all the values for a specific key to be inserted into a single unique key?</p>
<pre><code>kernelLinks = []

for values in output:
  links = links + ([("https://www.kaggle.com" + (values["scriptUrl"]))])

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
method = {}
dictionary = []

for url in links: 
    driver.get(url)
    driver.switch_to_frame(driver.find_element_by_tag_name("iframe"))
    data = driver.page_source
    data2 = BeautifulSoup(data, "lxml")

    for a in data2.find_all('span', class_="n"):
        data2 = BeautifulSoup(data, "lxml")
        dictionary = {}
        kernel = url
        method = a.text
        dictionary[kernel] = method
        print(dictionary)

<p>I think the relevant part of your question is:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You may want to use another data-structure to hold the different values.
For example a <em>set</em> if you're only interested what different values there are, but not in duplicates. (If you want to keep track all the values, switch to a <em>list</em> and use <em>append</em> instead of <em>add</em>.) This answer demonstrates how you could keep track of css classes assigned to different html elements on a page you want to parse. It assumes you somehow already obtained the elements and their classes.</p>
<pre><code>items = [
    ('span', 'pretty'),
    ('div', 'listing'),
    ('div', 'header'),
    ('span', 'ugly'),
    ('div', 'footer'),
]

data = dict()
for elem, css_class in items:
    classes = data.setdefault(elem, set())
    classes.add(css_class)

print data

<p>This speculative answer may get you going. Apart from that please have a look at the comments above, especially at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve</a>, as already mentioned by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1084416/peter-wood">@peter-wood</a> in his comment.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>dictionary1</code>? Where is <code>url</code> defined? It looks like <code>url</code> is coming from the previous <code>for</code> loop which has already run to completion so you'll just get the last value of <code>url</code>. Or, is the second <code>for</code> loop actually indented to be inside the first?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to Stack Overflow. Read up on how to create a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>. Most of your code is unrelated to the essence of your problem. Try to write a little bit of code to test your understanding of loops, as you recreate a new dictionary every time through. Also, have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b><code>defaultdict</code></b></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please provide a bit more context about your variables, and also the desired output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My apologies all, I have updated the question. I am trying to change the current key (kaggle url) to a unique that contains all the values that are currently being printed separately.</span>
