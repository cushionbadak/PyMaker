<p>Owing to some reason,I must use "win32com" this module to output my Dataframe from another appication (But this module seems to be only in python2).</p>
<p>However , I want to do some calculate in python3 with this Dataframe(output by python2).</p>
<p>How can I send the Dataframe from python2 to python3 in memory? (Except to output the data to the file)</p>
<hr/>
<p>Supplementary explanation 1:
My os is Win10 64bit (both contain python2 and python3)
In short , I want to know how can I pass the Data(produced by python2) to python3. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Supplementary explanation 2:
I have a A python script and it need to run in python2.
A python script will generated some data(maybe json , dataframe ..)
And then I want pass this data to B python script
B python script must run in python3.</p>
<p>My os is win10 64bits(both have python2 and 3).
I am a new to python , I have tried "out the data to the file ,then B.py read the file". However this I/O way is too slow , so I want pass data in memory , how can I do that?
(My English is not very good, please entertain me )</p>

<p>JSON is a convenient option.  </p>
<pre><code>import json
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What OS are you on? What are the requirements? Why do you need to do this? What have you already tried?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you can send arbitrary data via a socket or stream, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/generated/pandas.read_parquet.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>parquet</code></a> might be the most suited data format</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just want pass the data from python2 to python3 . I have tried "output the data to file" , but this I/O bound way is too slow .  My os is Win10 64bit (contain python2 and python3).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Seems like a good idea , however how can I pass "json" from python2 to python3 ?    tks for your reply = )</span>
<span class="comment-copy">json can be used to serialize data which can then be written to a flle.  your other program can then read that file and recreate the object</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know that . However written to a file is an I/O bound way. (My data is big , so this way will work very slow)Is there anyway that I can pass this data except output the file?</span>
