<p>Here I'm using <code>imapblib</code> and <code>email</code> to retrieve a certain email message based on certain criteria (i.e. who it's from and the subject).</p>
<pre><code>import imaplib
import email

FROM_EMAIL  = "##########@gmail.com"
FROM_PWD    = "##########"
SMTP_SERVER = "imap.gmail.com"

mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL(SMTP_SERVER)
mail.login(FROM_EMAIL,FROM_PWD)
mail.select("INBOX")
result, data2 = mail.search(None,'(FROM "####" SUBJECT "####")')
ids = data2[0]
id_list = ids.split()
latest_email_id = id_list[-1]
result, email_data = mail.fetch(latest_email_id, "(RFC822)")

raw_email = email_data[0][1]
raw_email_string = raw_email.decode('utf-8')
email_message = email.message_from_string(raw_email_string)
</code></pre>
<p>In the email, using gmail on my desktop, there is a link that appears like this (please note, the # character represents sensitive information):</p>
<pre><code># This is how the link is supposed to appear
https://inreach.garmin.com/textmessage/txtmsg?extId=e3e7d4c2-fab4-43ad-93de-f9dedca8280#####=##########%40gmail.com
</code></pre>
<p>When printing the email text as python has retrieved it, I get this bad link:</p>
<pre><code>email_text = list(email_message.walk())[1].get_payload()
print(email_text) # Note(I am not printing the whole email for privacy reasons)

# The link as python has retrieved it appears like this:

https://inreach.garmin.com/textmessage/txtmsg?extId=3De3e7d4c2-fab4-43ad-93=de-f9dedca8280#####=3D##########%40gmail.com
</code></pre>
<p>Python is somehow adding an <code>=</code> character between <code>93</code> and <code>de</code> and it is also adding several <code>3D</code> characters.</p>
<p>What is python doing?  Ideas on how to fix this?</p>

<p>What you're seeing is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoted-printable" rel="nofollow noreferrer">quoted-printable encoding</a>. It's one way of encoding arbitrary bytes into ASCII text for transmission through e.g. email. Among the consequences of this encoding are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <code>'='</code> character in your message gets encoded into <code>'=3D'</code> (because 0x3d is the character code for <code>'='</code>).</li>
<li>Lines are wrapped at 76 characters by inserting the sequence <code>'=\n'</code> (basically an escaped newline which the decoder will strip out). I bet one of these newlines got inserted in the middle of your link.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can convert the encoded text back to the original bytes using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/quopri.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>quopri</code> module</a> from the standard library. Some parts of Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">email handling library</a> may also do this for you.</p>
