<p>So I have a dictionary, with keys and values, and the values are letters. I want to sort the dictionary so that it prints alphabetically according to the values, but I just can't figure out how to go about it.</p>
<p>For example, I have this dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>dict = {5 : 'B', 7 : 'A', 9 : 'C'}
</code></pre>
<p>How do I get this to be sorted so that it prints out as follows?:</p>
<pre><code>{7 : 'A', 5 : 'B', 9 : 'C'}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Dicts are unsorted, if you need something in a certain order for sure, use a list. Also, you can't duplicate keys.</p>
<p>to make a list:</p>
<pre><code>your_list=['B','A','C']
#yay, now sort
your_list.sort()
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">That output is impossible, you can only have each key once. <code>dict</code> (don't name dictionaries <code>dict</code>) only contains one key-value pair.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>dict</code> objects are inherently unordered - it doesn't make sense to say "a sorted dict"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your dictionary itself is invalid.There can only be one key with the value <code>1</code> not three of them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry everyone. it was a typo. I made it so the keys are all different.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm a newbie, im sorry. Basically, i just want the values to be in alphabetical order, and have no idea on how to go about this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay. How would I go about changing this to a list, and then sorting by the values, aka the letters?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are other ordered data structures in Python besides lists (for example, a closer fit to a dictionary but with order might be an... <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OrderedDict</a>?)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@j.izzy I updated to show the list part</span>
