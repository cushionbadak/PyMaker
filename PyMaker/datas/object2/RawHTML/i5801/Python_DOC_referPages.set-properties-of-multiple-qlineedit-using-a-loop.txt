<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was wondering if it is possible to set multiple <code>setFixedHeight()</code> properties using a for loop:</p>
<pre><code>for num in range(1, 6):
    self.LineEdit[num].setFixedHeight()
</code></pre>
<p>currently I have twelve QLineEdit boxes</p>
<p>LineEdit1, LineEdit2, ... , LineEdit12 and I'm hoping to do this with less code. I tried the above method, and it did not iterate through the LineEdit boxes as I had expected. Would <code>self.LineEdit[num]</code> only work for a list?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>for this task you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>getattr()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(1,13):
    getattr(self, "LineEdit{}".format(i)).setFixedHeight(10)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You may use <code>findChildren()</code> function.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre><code>for ctl in self.findChildren(QtGui.QLineEdit):
    ctl.setFixedHeight()
</code></pre>
<p>Please note this will call <code>setFixedHeight()</code> on all Line Edits.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I found a different way to do it as well by creating a list using <code>getattr</code> and iterating through the list, but your method is by far cleaner. Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would like to have more control over what range of Line Edits are getting the <code>setFixedHeight()</code> attribute applied. Setting them like this might be useful in the future where I don't require so much control, I keep this in mind.</span>
