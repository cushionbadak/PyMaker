<p>Didn't know how to correctly write the title, so i will try to explain it here. I am making a game, similar to tic tac toe. The play field is 4x4 and i am saving it as an array. I want to make changes in the array during the game, but it will not print out the array each time, rather it makes changes statically. 
Lets say at the beginning i print out the whole field and under it the user is asked to type a position. He gives it and the changes are being done in the first printed playfield, without calling it again in the shell. Kinda sloppy explanation, sorry about that.</p>
<pre><code>play_field = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]

def print_playfield():
   for rows in play_field:
       print(*['{:&lt;4}'.format(each) for each in rows])
</code></pre>
<p>This is the function, which will display the playfield.I've done it with tkinter already, wanna try it without.</p>
