<p>I have coded a flask application on server.
I run it like below :-</p>
<pre><code>export FLASK_APP=mypyhthonfile
nohup flask run --host=host-ip --port=port-number
</code></pre>
<p>The python script has logger statements like:</p>
<pre><code>Logger.info("this is a log")
</code></pre>
<p>The logger statements are printed in both the logger file and nohup.out</p>
<p>What is the way to avoid printing logger statements in nohup.out ?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to have your logger in lower level than root logger:</p>
<p>In this example I set root logger to logging.WARNING (30) level and my test_logger is set to logging.DEBUG (10) so the root logger ( which nohup is listening to ) will not print anything (only string that you printed or have higher logging levels than 30) and there are logs that has more levels than logger's level in example.log.</p>
<pre><code>import logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='example.log', level=logging.WARNING)
test_logger = logging.getLogger('test')
test_logger.setLevel(level=logging.DEBUG)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You can disable logging to standard error but it's not clear from your problem statement if that's what you <i>actually</i> want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want that the logger.info() statements(in python script) should not be written to nohup.out</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Configure it to log to a file. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tripleee I have already done that and the issue is that logs are stored to both <code>nohup.out</code> and <code>python log file</code>; when it should be stored in only python log file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for answer. I will check and let you know</span>
