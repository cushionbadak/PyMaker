<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I try to using request.get with '@' in params, but in output I have '%40' How I can decode this dict?</p>
<p>Using Python3</p>
<pre><code>import requests

payload = {'OPERATION-NAME': 'findItemsByProduct','productId.@type':'ReferenceID'}

req = requests.post(url, params=payload)

print(req.url)
</code></pre>
<p>The output is - 'url?productId.%40type=ReferenceID'</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use "data" argument instead of params. You should also specify the header, in this case json and then convert the payload dict to json using json.dumps().</p>
<pre><code>import requests
import json


payload = {'productId.@type':'ReferenceID'}

req = requests.post(url, headers={'Content-Type': 'application/JSON'}, data=json.dumps(payload))

print(req.url)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Maybe <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8628152/url-decode-with-python-3">this</a> is what you're looking for?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I checked this too, does not work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.unquote" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>urllib.parse.unquote</code></a>: <code>unquote("url?productId.%40type=ReferenceID")</code> returns <code>'url?productId.@type=ReferenceID'</code>. What's wrong about that?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Heya, the comment section isn't for discussing new problems that arise. If you've solved it partially and are getting new exceptions, it's time to open a new question (after doing proper research!) :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see you answered OP, but didn't provide an explanation. Please include some context in your answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's does not work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I forgot to include the header, try again and let me know. Make sure you have a valid url. BTW what you get is not the request (req) it's the response so you should rename req by resp.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">TypeError: request() got an unexpected keyword argument 'header'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What python are you using? Pyhton2 / Python3, What requests version??</span>
