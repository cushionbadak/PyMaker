<p>I'm trying to count the number of times a person presses a button a certain number of times.</p>
<pre><code>import turtle         

if random.randint(1,2) == 2:
     turtle.listen()
     turtle.onkey(number() ,'s')

else:
    pass

def number():
   global shots
   shots += 1 
</code></pre>
<p>shots was declared earlier.</p>
<p>That's what I've done but I need to set some type of time limit, so the user can only press it for say 4 seconds then if shots are bigger than a number it's do something. </p>
<p>Is there any way to do this, thank you </p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle#turtle.ontimer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>turtle.ontimer</code></a> function to implement a timer. In the <code>timer</code> function I increment the global time variable and call <code>turtle.ontimer(timer, t=100)</code> which automatically calls <code>timer</code> again after the specified timer <code>t</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import turtle


turtle.listen()

def number():
   global shots
   shots += 1
   print('Shots', shots)


def timer():
    global time
    time += .1  # Increase the global time variable.
    print(round(time, 1))
    if time &lt; 2:  # 2 seconds.
       # Call `timer` function again after 100 ms.
       turtle.ontimer(timer, t=100)
    else:
       print('Time is up.')
       # Do something.

shots = 0
time = -0.1  # -0.1 because the `timer` adds .1 immediately.

timer()
turtle.onkey(number, 's')
turtle.mainloop()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Already you need to write <code>shots += 1</code> (you forgot the sign <code>=</code>). Then,  were does <code>turtle</code> come from? If it's a user-defined object, tell us a bit more about it. If it comes from a module, include a line that imports this module.</span>
