<p>I am making a text adventure game in Python 3 and I am trying to use a random code found in one part of the game and used as a password for the final part of the game but I don't know how to make the random generated code the password. I have the random number generator. How do I make the number that is generated the password.</p>
<pre><code>import random
def code():
     numbers = random.sample(range(10), 4)
     print(''.join(map(str, numbers)))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Make your function not print, but return the code:</p>
<pre><code>def code():
    numbers = random.sample(range(10), 4)
    return ''.join(map(str, numbers))
</code></pre>
<p>and in your program, store it to a variable, so that you can both print and query for it:</p>
<pre><code># ...
password = code()
print(password)
# ...
check = input('Enter password:\n')
if check == password:
    # yeah
</code></pre>
</div>
