<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have two lists as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    a = [[1,128,"11:18:23.456",2,0,0,"P"],[2,1345,"22:18:23.456",2,1,0,"Q"],[3,1365,"24:18:23.456",1,0,0,"N"]]
    b = [[1,128,"11:18:23.456",2,0,0,"P"],[2,1345,"22:18:23.456",2,1,0,"Q"],[2,1345,"22:18:23.456",2,1,0,"Q"]]
</code></pre>
<p>I need to merge them (and also sort them based on the second entry in each list (i.e. 128,1345,1365) in such a way that I get the following merged lists:</p>
<pre><code>    c_before_sort = [[1,128,"11:18:23.456",2,0,0,"P"],[2,1345,"22:18:23.456",2,1,0,"Q"],[3,1365,"24:18:23.456",1,0,0,"N"],[1,128,"11:18:23.456",2,0,0,"P"],[2,1345,"22:18:23.456",2,1,0,"Q"],[2,1345,"22:18:23.456",2,1,0,"Q"]]
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>    c_after_sort = [[1,128,"11:18:23.456",2,0,0,"P"],[1,128,"11:18:23.456",2,0,0,"P"],[2,1345,"22:18:23.456",2,1,0,"Q"],[2,1345,"22:18:23.456",2,1,0,"Q"],[2,1345,"22:18:23.456",2,1,0,"Q"],[3,1365,"24:18:23.456",1,0,0,"N"]]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Well this seems easy enough:</p>
<pre><code>c = a[:]
c.extend(b)
c.sort(key=lambda lst: lst[2])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just merge <code>+</code> the lists together, and sort based on the second element of each list with <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/operator.html#operator.itemgetter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>operator.itemgetter()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from operator import itemgetter

b = [[1,128,"11:18:23.456",2,0,0,"P"],[2,1345,"22:18:23.456",2,1,0,"Q"],[2,1345,"22:18:23.456",2,1,0,"Q"]]

c_before_sort = a + b

c_after_sort = sorted(c_before_sort, key = itemgetter(1))
print(c_after_sort)
# [[1, 128, '11:18:23.456', 2, 0, 0, 'P'], [1, 128, '11:18:23.456', 2, 0, 0, 'P'], [2, 1345, '22:18:23.456', 2, 1, 0, 'Q'], [2, 1345, '22:18:23.456', 2, 1, 0, 'Q'], [2, 1345, '22:18:23.456', 2, 1, 0, 'Q'], [3, 1365, '24:18:23.456', 1, 0, 0, 'N']]
