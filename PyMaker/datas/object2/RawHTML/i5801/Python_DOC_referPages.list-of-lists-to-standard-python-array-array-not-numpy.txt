<p>I want to convert a list of lists to a standard Python array.array. Let's take good ol' [[1.0, 2.0][3.0, 4.0]] as an example. Answers to similar Q seem to all be in terms of NumPy. I am doing something to be used by folks who are very unlikely to import numpy.</p>

<p>This is not possible, as <code>array.array</code> arrays are 1-dimensional. You can't even make a nested array, as <code>array.array</code> arrays only hold primitives.</p>
<p>You should probably read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>array</code> module docs</a> and think about whether <code>array.array</code> arrays are actually suitable for your use case, as you seem to be expecting more NumPy-like behavior from them than they actually provide.</p>
