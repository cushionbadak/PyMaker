<p>
I want it to spit out the correct values, like 3 and 4, totaling 7.
<br/>
But, it always prints out 5 and 5, totaling 10 and I don't know why...  </p>

<p>I guess you are not using Python 3, cause raw_input is just renamed input() in Python 3. When I tried running your code with input(), it had a bunch of problems because you are comparing a string value (input() returns a string) to an integer value (120 for example). Try fixing this for the time being and keep us posted with your new results. :)</p>

<p>raw_input() and input() handle things differently, so when I used raw_input() instead of input() It changed the code enough to fail me out. 
Why it did that I do not know, but it did.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">if you figured it out, you may as well delete your question...</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>"'raw_input()' and 'input()' apparently handle things differently. "</i> - Well in Python 2 they are. In Python 3, <code>raw_input</code> was renamed <code>input</code> and the old <code>input</code> function was removed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">instead of nested if/else, why not use <code>elif</code>?  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#if</a></span>
