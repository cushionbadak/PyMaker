<p>Hi, I am trying to append four variables (score, gender, class and initials) into a CSV file so it displays as so:</p>
<pre><code>with open ('untitled.csv','w') as file_out:
    file_out.write(score)
    file_out.write(real_player_class)
    file_out.write(current_player_gender)
    file_out.write(current_player_initials)

df_test = pd.read_csv('untitled.csv')
df_test
</code></pre>
<p>
I would like the result to look like this in a Dataframe:</p>
<pre><code>score gender class initials
</code></pre>
<p>with the stats underneath them, like this:</p>
<pre><code>score gender class initials
1        M  senior   YTU
</code></pre>
<p>
Currently, in my code, this is what the dataframe looks like (in a dataframe):
    0seniorMYTU </p>
<p>Is there a way to solve this? How do I append the score, gender, class and initials variables into their respective columns?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You need commas between values and newlines between rows. You can write them manually or use the  csv module for convince. </p>
