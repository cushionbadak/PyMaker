<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a code which takes a user's input which is supposed to be a first and last name. My code then takes that input and searches a csv for projects and hours that the input name is associated to. The problem I'm running into is if I misspell or don't capitalize the first letter of each name the code will not work. Is there a function or a way out there where if the user inputs the first 3 letters right or something similar the code will automatically assume the correct spelling and change the input accordingly? I'm a very novice coder so any help would be great. </p>
<p>Here's my code for reference:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

# I've used full name to avoid duplicate first names in report 
full_name = input('Enter your full name: ')

with open('Report1.csv') as csvfile:
    hour_summation = {}
    read_csv = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')
    for row in read_csv:
            if ' '.join((row[0], row[1])) == full_name.strip():
                hour_summation[row[2]] = hour_summation.get(row[2], 0) + int(float(row[3]))
print('This is {} full hours report:'.format(full_name))
for k, v in hour_summation.items():
    print(k + ': ' + str(v) + ' hours')
</code></pre>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=lower#str.lower" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.lower</code></a> on both the user input and the value from the csv to ignore case.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=lower#str.startswith" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.startswith</code></a> to match the user input against the beginning of a value from the csv. You could also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#membership-test-details" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>in</code></a> to detemrine if the user input is in a value from the csv.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If the number of possible user names isn't too large, then create a list of them, normalize all by calling <code>lower()</code> on it (same normalization for a name to search) and take a look at <code>difflib.SequenceMatcher</code>, especially <code>ratio()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could look at fuzzy matching. <a href="https://marcobonzanini.com/2015/02/25/fuzzy-string-matching-in-python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">marcobonzanini.com/2015/02/25/fuzzy-string-matching-in-python</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">make all the strings lowercase before comparison should make things a lot easier, e.g. <code>full_name = input('Enter your full name: ').strip().lower()</code>, <code>' '.join((row[0], row[1])).lower()</code>, etc.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">This is great. I was able to use the lower() function. I'm still learning how to implement the startswith.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@stevenmiller You will probably want something like <code>if value_from_csv.startswith(user_input):</code></span>
