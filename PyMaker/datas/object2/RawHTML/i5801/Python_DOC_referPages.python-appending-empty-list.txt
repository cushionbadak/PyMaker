<p>I am very new to Python and trying to learn by trial-and-error, so my question may sound naive for the community.</p>
<p>Let's say I have two empty lists with only the first element defined:</p>
<pre><code>a = [[]]*20
a[0] = 0
b = [[]]*20
b[0] = 1
</code></pre>
<p>I want to use a for loop for creating the other elements of the lists:</p>
<pre><code>x = 20
for i in range(1,x):
    a[i] = b[i-1],
    b[i] = a[i-1]+b[i-1]
</code></pre>
<p>What I obtain is the following error:<code>TypeError: can only concatenate tuple (not "int") to tuple</code>.
Basically I am trying to reproduce the fibonacci series (a famous starting point in Python tutorial), but I would like to experiment other ways of obtaining the same output.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>The problem is on this line:</p>
<pre><code>a[i] = b[i-1],
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the comma at the end? That makes python think you're dealing in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tuples</a>. Remove it and the error will be gone.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You have an extraneous comma at the end of the first line of the loop, which turns it into a tuple.</span>
