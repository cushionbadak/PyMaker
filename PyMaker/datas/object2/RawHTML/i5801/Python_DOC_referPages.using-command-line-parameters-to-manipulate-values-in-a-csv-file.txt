<p>I am given a variety of .csv files and for each one I need to identify the keys associated with the longest list; and print that key. As well as the values that only appear in the last column of the csv file, and print that value. I am encouraged to use command line parameters, which I am new to so I'm having a hard time with this. Here is an example of a csv file given:<br/>
Grasshopper,Grass<br/>
Lizard,Grasshopper<br/>
Hawk,Grasshopper,Lizard,Rabbit,Mouse,Snake<br/>
Rabbit,Grass<br/>
Snake,Mouse<br/>
Mouse,Grass  </p>
<p>So the key with the longest list I would be trying to print is the Hawk.
This is the code I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>    import sys
    import csv
    if len(sys.argv) != "":
        inf = open(sys.argv[0], "r")
        outf = open(sys.argv[1], "w")

        words = 0
        maxvalue = 0

        line = inf.readline()
        for line in data:
            while line != "":
               words = words + len(line.split())

               maxvalue = maxvalue + words
               if words &gt; value:
                   maxline = words

              # Read the next line from the file.
              line = inf.readline()

       outf.write(str(maxvalue))
</code></pre>
<p>But with my little knowledge of command line parameters it doesn't work as I am given an index error, and I'm unsure of how to fix it.
Prior to this code I have opened/read the files. I'm using <strong>python3</strong>, any help would be much appreciated!!
Thank you!</p>

<p>You need to change your <code>if</code> condition to:</p>
<pre><code>if sys.argv[1:]:
</code></pre>
<p><code>[1:]</code> means 'every element from <code>sys.argv</code> except the first'. <code>sys.argv[1:]</code> will be an empty list if there are no commandline arguments, which evaluates as <code>False</code>. A non-empty list evaluates as <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>The first element of <code>sys.argv</code> is the file name (or <code>''</code> if you're in the REPL) so </p>
<pre><code>if sys.argv:
</code></pre>
<p>will always evaluate as <code>True</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Try this in the REPL</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.argv
['']
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool(sys.argv)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.argv[1:]
[]
&gt;&gt;&gt; bool(sys.argv[1:])
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; if sys.argv:
...     print('aaa')
...
aaa
&gt;&gt;&gt; if sys.argv[1:]:
...     print('aaa')
...

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! That seemed to work in terms of getting rid of the error message. I'm not sure what I would call on to print? also, is the outf write function necessary? or is It possible to get the correct input by just including a read statement? Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem, glad it worked for you. Given the solution worked, you should mark my answer as 'accepted'.  To print I would use the builtin <code>print</code> function. It prints to the stdout stream, meaning the text will come up in your terminal.  Regarding <code>inf</code> and <code>outf</code>: If you want to write to a file, yes you need the <code>outf.write</code>. But you should access files using the <code>with</code> statement, this is safer because you don't need to remember to close the file (which you have forgotten to do):  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a></span>
