<p>Using spyder 3.2.4 with python.</p>
<p>When I call i function (in another file) lets call it my_func() from my main script, it uses the "old version" of that function. Clarification:</p>
<p>If i change my_func and save that file, the new version of the function is used if called from my main script, BUT only if I run the entire main script.</p>
<p>If i just run the lines with my_func (using run cell or run selected lines) the OLD version of my_func (before the changes was mad) is used.</p>
<p>I though my_func had to be "reimported" (from myOtherFile import my_func), so I try to run those lines as well, but the old version of the function (not changed) is still used.</p>
<p>Did I misunderstand something or is this a really, really serious bug? If i close down spyder and restart it it works (it uses the new version of the function) but that's an unacceptable solution.</p>

<p>This behavior has to do with how the (I)Python interpreter handles imports.</p>
<p>You can find a detailed explanation (with possible solutions) here: <a href="https://support.enthought.com/hc/en-us/articles/204469240-Jupyter-IPython-After-editing-a-module-changes-are-not-effective-without-kernel-restart" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://support.enthought.com/hc/en-us/articles/204469240-Jupyter-IPython-After-editing-a-module-changes-are-not-effective-without-kernel-restart</a></p>
<p>Short answer:<br/>
- either restart the kernel<br/>
- or use importlib.reload (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload</a>)<br/>
- or use IPython's autoreload extension (<a href="http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/extensions/autoreload.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/extensions/autoreload.html</a>)</p>

<p>(<em>Spyder maintainer here</em>) This is not a bug, it's the way Python works. However, the normal behavior can be improved by making our IPython consoles to load the <code>%autoreload</code> IPython magic. With that change, after saving a file you'll immediately get the code on it reloaded in your console.</p>
<p>We'll do this in our <strong>3.2.5</strong> version (to be released on December 2017).</p>
