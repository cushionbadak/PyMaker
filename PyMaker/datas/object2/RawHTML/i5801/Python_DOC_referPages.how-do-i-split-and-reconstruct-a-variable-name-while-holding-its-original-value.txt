<p>Is it possible to split variables that have already been assigned values, and re-piece them back together to hold those same previous values?</p>
<p>For Example:</p>
<pre><code>URLs.QA.Signin = 'https://qa.test.com'
TestEnvironment = 'QA'
CurrentURL = 'URLs.' + TestEnvironment + '.Signin'
print(CurrentURL)
</code></pre>
<p>Outputs as: 'URLs.QA.Signin'</p>
<p>but I would like it to:</p>
<p>Output as: '<a href="https://qa.test.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://qa.test.com</a>'</p>
<p>The purpose is so I can plug in any value to my 'TestEnvironment' variable and thus access any of my massive list of URL's with ease =P</p>
<p>I am green with Python. Your time and efforts are greatly appreciated! =)</p>

<p>Based upon evanrelf's answer, I tried and loved the following code!:</p>
<h1>This is exactly what i'm looking for, I might be over complicating it, any suggestions to clean up the code?</h1>
<pre><code>urls = {}
environment = 'qa'
district = 'pleasanthill'
url = environment + district
urls[url] = 'https://' + environment + '.' + district + '.test.com'
print(urls[url])
</code></pre>
<p>Output is: <a href="https://qa.pleasanthill.test.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://qa.pleasanthill.test.com</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would recommend you look into Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionaries</a>.</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>urls = {}
urls['qa'] = 'https://qa.test.com'

test_environment = 'qa'
print(urls[test_environment])
// =&gt; https://qa.test.com
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I believe to my comprehension that you are trying to input a string and get a new string (the url) back. The simplest answer that I can understand is to use a dictionary. An example of this is by simply doing</p>
<pre><code>URLS = {'sheep' : 'wool.com', 'cows' : 'beef.com'}
</code></pre>
<p>either this or by using two arrays and referencing a common index, but who wants to do that :p</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi llja - So I looked at the potential duplicate: "How do I create a variable number of variables" and it could very well be a duplicate. But for me it is difficult to understand that post. I think if nothing else this post is a bit more simplistic for those who are beginners. Your thoughts? =) (I appreciate your due dilligence to keep the posts nice and clean! =P)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much for the example, and the reference to learn dictionaries, I have been staring at and testing dictionary code for the last few hours! =)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welcome! I don't know exactly how you're organizing these URLs, but you might also want to check out nested dictionaries (a dictionary within a dictionary). That way you could say something like <code>urls['qa']['pleasanthill']</code>. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/16333441/1664444">stackoverflow.com/a/16333441/1664444</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I love this idea as well, this is certainly getting me thinking! =) (Yeah no kidding referenceing index's can get confusing really fast LOL =P)</span>
