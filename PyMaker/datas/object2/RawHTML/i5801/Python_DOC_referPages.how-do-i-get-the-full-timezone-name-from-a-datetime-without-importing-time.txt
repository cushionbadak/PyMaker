<p>I'm trying to display my full time zone along with my current local time.</p>
<pre><code>print "Your current time is {0} {1} ".format(datetime.datetime.now().time(), time.tzname[0])
</code></pre>
<p>And the result would look something like:</p>
<pre><code>Your current time is 08:35:45.328000 Pacific Standard Time 
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is I have to import the Time library (sorry if I call it wrong, I'm coming from C#) along with the Datetime library.</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
import time
</code></pre>
<p>I've looked into the <code>naive</code> and <code>aware</code> states of time, but still can't seem to get the desired result.</p>
<p>Is there a way to get the full timezone name (i.e.: Pacific Standard Time) from Datetime without having to import Time? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The example for writing your own local timezone <code>tzinfo</code> class uses (scroll down one page from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.tzinfo.fromutc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>) pulls the <code>tzname</code> from <code>time.tzname</code>, so Python doesn't have a better built-in solution to suggest.</p>
<p>You could copy that example <code>LocalTimezone</code> implementation, which would allow the use of the <code>%Z</code> format code for <code>strftime</code> on an aware <code>datetime</code> instance using the <code>LocalTimezone</code>, but that's the best you can do with the built-ins. On a naive <code>datetime</code> the <code>tzname</code> is the empty string, so you <em>need</em> an aware <code>datetime</code> for this to work.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The <code>time</code> module doesn't do anything for you here. Are you perhaps looking for the <code>pytz</code> third-party module?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShadowRanger It helps me get the timezone name in the code time.tzname[0] and it returns "Pacific Standard Time".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah. You're checking the local timezone name independent of a <code>datetime</code> instance. That works, though it doesn't extrapolate to the scenario where you've got a saved <code>datetime</code> from "somewhere" and need to display the associated timezone. It doesn't look like that information is made available for naive <code>datetime</code>s, but the cost of importing <code>time</code> is trivial (<code>datetime</code> imports is during its own import, so <code>import time</code> just pulls the cached copy loaded at the same time as <code>datetime</code>). Why do you want to avoid it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShadowRanger just a don't-repeat-yourself practice. Datetime should already have its capability to display time and its info, especially a date should naturally be "aware" of what timezone it's in.</span>
