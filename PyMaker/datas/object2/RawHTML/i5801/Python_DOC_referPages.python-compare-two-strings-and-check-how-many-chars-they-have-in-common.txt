<p>I'm just wondering how I can check how many chars two string have in common.
For example if I have "car" and "cars", the result should be 3. </p>
<p>Anybody a clue?</p>
<p>Cheers and thanks in advance</p>

<p>Here's a solution using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Counter</code></a>.  We make a <code>Counter</code> for each of the words, then find the intersection of those <code>Counter</code>s.  That itself is a <code>Counter</code>, and we can just sum the values to find the number of shared characters</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

def shared_chars(s1, s2):
    return sum((Counter(s1) &amp; Counter(s2)).values())

print(shared_chars('car', 'carts'))
</code></pre>
<p>will print </p>
<pre><code>3
</code></pre>
<p>In case of <code>Counter</code>, intersection is the minimum of corresponding counts.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; Counter('abbb') &amp; Counter('bcc')
Counter({'b': 1})
</code></pre>

<p>Since you didn't write any code, I won't either. But basically this:</p>
<p>-convert strings to list</p>
<p>-use set to get letters they have in common</p>
<p>-get length of your set</p>
<p>Biggest hazard here would be if you wanted to count repeating letters</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Something like this </p>
<pre><code>count = 0

for letter in set(string1):
  count += string2.count(letter)

print(count)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">like in any order or in specific spots, ie car, rac = 3 as well? what about repeats</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you know how to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43605490/python-iterate-over-string">Iterate over a string in Python</a>? That will let you go character by character.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Iterate though the first string, add 1 if you find the current character in the second string. Return result ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@lPlant yes, car and rac should be 3 as well</span>
