<p>How do you split a list by space? With the code below, it reads a file with 4 lines of 7 numbers separated by spaces. When it takes the file and then splits it, it splits it by number so if i print item[0], 5 will print instead of 50. here is the code</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    filename = input("Enter the name of the file: ")
    infile = open(filename, "r")
    for i in range(4):
        data = infile.readline()
        print(data)
        item = data.split()
        print(data[0])

main()
</code></pre>
<p>the file looks like this </p>
<p>50 60 15 100 60 15 40 /n
100 145 20 150 145 20 45 /n
50 245 25 120 245 25 50 /n
100 360 30 180 360 30 55 /n</p>

<p>Split takes as argument the character you want to split your string with.</p>
<p>I invite you to read the documentation of methods you are using. :)</p>
<p>EDIT : By the way, readline returns a <strong>string</strong>, not a **list **.
However, split does return a list. </p>

<p>Try this once you have opened that file.</p>

<p>There's not a lot wrong with what you are doing, except that you are printing the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Instead of</p>
<pre><code>print(data[0])
</code></pre>
<p>use</p>
<pre><code>print(item[0])
</code></pre>
<p><code>data[0]</code> is the first character of the string you read from file. You split this string into a variable called <code>item</code> so that's what you should print.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Durr. <code>item[0]</code> is the first entry in the result list of the split. <code>data[0]</code>is the first character of the string you are splitting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, you should do that first, from <code>split()</code> docs: "If sep is not specified or is None, a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh lol, thanks mate. I guess I learned a lesson today. Never take anything for granted. :</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, yes, but your answer doesn't answer the question/problem the OP has.</span>
