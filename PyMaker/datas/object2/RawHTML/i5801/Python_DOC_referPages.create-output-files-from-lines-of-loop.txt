<p>I have list like this:</p>
<pre><code>test_list = ['test1','test2','test3']
</code></pre>
<p>I want to create from each element of the array a separate txt file and write content to that like in below:</p>
<pre><code>for test in test_list:
    print (test, outfile=testdir/test + '.txt')
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously this code doesn't work. I would like to know how can I do this?</p>

<p>This will help you </p>
<pre><code>test_list = ['test1','test2','test3']

for test in test_list:
    f = open('{}.txt'.format(test),'wb') #
    f.write(test)
    f.close()

<p>I thing it will help you.</p>
<pre><code>test_list = ['test1','test2','test3']
for l in test_list:
    with open('{}.txt'.format(l), 'a') as s:
         s.write(l)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to write something you can use same as above.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>outfile</code> (which should be <code>file</code>) must be a Python's <i>file object</i>. <b>Please read the docs before asking questions and even attempting to write code.</b> Quote from <code>help(print)</code>: "file:  a <i>file-like object</i> (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ForceBru. I know. just wanted to show that what I need :). But I don't know how to create this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't know how to open files?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know how to open multiple file. Because this was just example it can be 10000 files</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure that you really want to keep 10000 files opened <i>at the same time</i>???</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It won't on Python 3.x: <code>TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah , but he has mentioned 2.7 also</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which was definitely a mistake as <code>print(stuff, arg=stuff)</code> works in Python 3.x only.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ForceBru not necessarily, <code>from __future__ import print_function</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga, however, the OP's code doesn't have this line. Tagging with both Python 3.x and Python 2.7 is strange anyway. 2 out of 3 answers here don't work in Python 3.x, so using both tags is clearly confusing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is the correct method for Python 3.x as per the docs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@dijksterhuis, this code doesn't work in Python 3.x</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ForceBru it will if you change <code>wb</code> to <code>w+</code>. I was talking about the use of <code>with open</code> in terms of correct methods.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't work as <code>s.write</code> returns an <i>integer</i>: <code>AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'close'</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you are using the <code>with open</code> syntax, you shouldn't need to call the <code>close()</code> method afterwards. See @user2614596 answer above</span>
<span class="comment-copy">O yeah It's My mistak, I have correct now.</span>
