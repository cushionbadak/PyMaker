<p>I'm trying to parse a given string of custom format date into epoch time with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>time_tuple = time.strptime('Tue Dec 05 13:01:48 PST 2017', '%a %b %d %X %Z %Y')
time_epoch = time.mktime(time_tuple)
</code></pre>
<p>The given date format is as shown in the code. The problem I'm facing is when the code is compile I keep getting error saying:</p>
<pre><code> ValueError: time data 'Tue Dec 05 13:01:48 PST 2017' does not match format '%a %b %d %X %Z %Y'
</code></pre>
<p>From what I can see, the format seems to be exactly as specified according to: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html</a></p>
<p>What seem's to be wrong?</p>
<p>Edit: 
I have tried using datetime instead of time as well, but didn't work</p>
<pre><code>time_tuple = datetime.strptime('Tue Dec 05 13:01:48 PST 2017', '%a %b %d %X %Z %Y')
</code></pre>
<p>Based on the comments below, it seems like the timezone field(%Z) is causing the problem. It seems like that field is based on the timezone the code is ran, and not the timezone the input string gives.</p>

<p>You are using a different time zone than those described in the docs, however, if you change the time zone, you can try this:</p>
<pre><code>import time
time_tuple = time.strptime('Tue Dec 05 13:01:48 EST 2017', '%a %b %d %X %Z %Y')
time_epoch = time.mktime(time_tuple)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It is locale-dependent, so maybe you are using a non-English locale which means the English abbreviations are wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But <code>time_tuple = time.strptime('Tue Dec 05 13:01:48 EST 2017', '%a %b %d %X %Z %Y')</code> throws the exception. I can reproduce it locally.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey, I tried EST, same error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Very odd, I ran this using both Python2 and Python3 and it worked fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure even sure where to start on this one. What version of Python 3? But for sure: <code>ValueError: time data 'Tue Dec 05 13:01:48 EST 2017' does not match format '%a %b %d %X %Z %Y'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've narrowed it down to the timezone %Z argument. I am running into the same issue. Based on the docs, it seems like this should work. I'm running Windows 10, Python 3.6.0.</span>
