<p>I think my question sounds kinda stupid but I'm pretty new to python programming. </p>
<p>I just want to have a text variable which gets a string from a .txt file at an FTP server.</p>
<p>So in conclusion: There is a .txt File stored at an FTP server and I want to have the content of this file stored in an variable...</p>
<p>This is what I have so far... Can anybody help me? I use Python 3.6.3 :) thanks in advance!</p>
<pre><code>from ftplib import FTP

ftp = FTP('1bk2t.ddns.net')
ftp.login(user='User', passwd = 'Password')

ftp.cwd('/path/')

filename = 'filename.txt'

ftp.retrbinary("RETR " + filename, open(filename, 'wb').write)
ftp.quit()

var = localfile.read
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to download a text file contents to memory, without using any temporary file, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html#ftplib.FTP.retrlines" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>retrlines</code> like</a>:</p>
<pre><code>contents = ""
def collectLines(s):
    global contents
    contents += s + "\n"

ftp.retrlines("RETR " + filename, collectLines)
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Or use an array:</p>
<pre><code>lines = []
ftp.retrlines("RETR " + filename, lines.append)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you :) The first method wouldn't work for me. Don't really know the reason why? The array method worked without any problem at all so I used that one for my project :) really really thank you, you made my day :)</span>
