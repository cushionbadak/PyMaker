<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a database composed of XML, JSON and CSV files. Those are generated from several pieces of software.</p>
<p>I have a list of thousands of <strong>NAMES</strong> that are supposed to be <strong>UNIQUE NAMES</strong>. So I used the <em>set()</em> format to have them as unique. The problem is that when people used the softwares, some of them (probably by mistake) added an space char after their surname. Hence I'm having trouble to pass this data to a MySQL database as I'm about to use the UNIQUE_NAMES as Primary Key for my db and somehow the MSQLdb recognize both <em>'Name1'</em> and <em>'Name1 '</em> as the same key.</p>
<p><strong>I know very little about DB, and ppl say that Names are not a very useful key. Still there's a purpose to have them with different names, or even nicknames.</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to have suggestions for what I could do to fix this issue.</p>
<p>I was wondering if popping the space character would be a good option, but the names are <em>"NAME SURNAME"</em> and it will be <em>"NAMESURNAME"</em> after popping. Another option I was thinking was to somehow pop the entire <em>"NAME SURNAME"</em> if the last character IS spacecharacter but I could lose some of the <em>UNIQUE_NAMES</em> that made this mistake and used the software only once. </p>
<p>I appreciate any effort for solving my issue</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> 
As you guys signed my question as "too broad" I'm giving more info about the problem.</p>
<p>In my list of names I have some entries like that</p>
<pre><code>mylist = ["John Doe", "Jones Does", "Jones K. Doesnt, "John Doe "...]
</code></pre>
<p>Those names repeat many times, everytime they use the softwares I'm working with, the name of the user is computed in a LOG file.</p>
<p>so I asked Python to give me a set() of UNIQUENAMES.</p>
<pre><code>unique_names = set(mylist)
set(mylist)
"John Doe", "Jones Does", "Jones K. Doesnt, "John Doe "
</code></pre>
<p>John Doe was appearing twice in my unique_names set() as "John Doe" != "John Doe " is True.</p>
<p>I'd like to know how to take the last space character out of the many names in my list.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I will suggest using <code>rstrip()</code></p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt;&gt; "    xyz     ".rstrip()
    '    xyz'
</code></pre>
<p>See the docs here <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rstrip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Docs</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please specify exactly what you would like answered. "Solving your issue" is too broad, If you would like to know how to remove the spaces in all surnames (as I am guessing that is what you really want) then showing us how they were defined and even some sample code for how you tried to remove the spaces would be useful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">use RegEx to Pop Spaces not between two Strings/Chars,but last one</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why dont you just call <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#string.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>strip()</code></a> on the name to remove the whitespace before you use it as the key?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AK47 - I didnt expect I could do it with a simple method like rstrip(). I'm learning more everyday. Thanks ppl for the answers.</span>
