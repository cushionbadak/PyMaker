<p>I am trying to break the line by commas and merge each word with each other. The file is in csv format and looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>babydoll,baby doll    
cami,camisole,cani    
halter,halter top
</code></pre>
<p>The code I'm currently using:</p>
<pre><code>import collections
file = 'C:\\Users\\Shashank\\Documents\\Codes\\new.csv'
new_set = set()
with open (file, 'r') as f:
     s = f.read().split(",")
     print (s, end = "\n")
</code></pre>
<p>Output SHOULD BE:</p>
<pre><code>['"babydoll baby doll', 'baby doll babydoll'"\n"'cami camisole', 'camisole cami', 'cani cami camisole'"\n"'halter halter top', 'halter top halter"\n']
</code></pre>
<p>Output which I got:</p>
<pre><code>['"babydoll', 'baby doll"\n"cami', 'camisole', 'cani"\n"halter', 'halter top"\n']
</code></pre>
<p>I want to create words by adding the word which is next to by splitting <code>","</code>. For example: I have a string of words in row 1 <code>t1,t2,t3</code>, 
words should be:</p>
<pre><code>t1 + t2, t1+3, t2 + t1, t3 + t1, t3 + t1
</code></pre>
<p>I already posted the ideal output at the top</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is not clear exactly what you are trying to do is but I suggest you take a look at Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html?highlight=permutations#itertools.permutations" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.permutations()</code></a> function.</p>
<p>For each line of your CSV file, split the line on commas and then pass the resulting list to this function to give you all unique pairs:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import permutations            

output = []  

with open('new.csv', 'r') as f_input:
    for row in  f_input.read().splitlines():
        for p in permutations(row.split(','), 2):
            output.append(' '.join(p))

print(output)            
</code></pre>
<p>For the example you have given, this would create a list containing:</p>
<pre><code>['babydoll baby doll', 'baby doll babydoll', 'cami camisole', 'cami cani', 'camisole cami', 'camisole cani', 'cani cami', 'cani camisole', 'halter halter top', 'halter top halter']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the edit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Cut him slack guys, new user. He has the code in the post, it was all commented.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShashankSahu Is that output correct? How are you getting it, is there some logic to it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Regardless of the formatting, I don't understand what is actually being asked. E.g. it's unclear what the intended transformation of input to output actually is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Probably itertools.permutations since for "a,b" he wants "a b" and "b a".</span>
