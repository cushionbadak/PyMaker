<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python 3.6 when entering the code</p>
<pre><code>var = 1
var1 = input("Hey var = ",(var),"Bye : ")
</code></pre>
<p>for some reason it comes out with an error message</p>
<pre><code>    var1 = input("Hey var = ",(var),"Bye : ")
TypeError: input expected at most 1 arguments got 1/2/3/4/5/6+
</code></pre>
<p>Does anyone know how to fix this so it runs like:</p>
<pre><code>Hey var = 1 Bye : (where you enter text)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>input</code> expects a string as an argument so you can't pass it multiple args like with <code>print</code>. Instead you can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#custom-string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">format</a> the string before you pass it to <code>input</code>:</p>
<pre><code>var = 1
var1 = input(f"Hey var = {var} Bye : ")
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>f</code> before the string is short for format and is new in Python 3.6, you can read more about it <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Sorry, I might not answer your question fully but you can't have more than one argument in <code>input()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>var = 1
var1 = input("Enter something:")
print(f"Hey {var} Bye : {var1}")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>For some reason"</i> - because you're passing more than the one argument it expects, as the message tells you. Maybe make the prompt string first? <code>input('Hey var = {} Bye :'.format(var))</code>, for example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Awesome thanks. bphi. Can you make that an answer so i cant close this. Also what is the "f" for at the start?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe that f before "Hey ..." is a typo.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JosephRyle you believe wrong - <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If u can, could you tell me what the "f" is for</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matt see my comment above, or just <i>run it and see</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, Python 3.6. That explains it.</span>
