<p>Can someone show me a few lines of code on how to add one day to datetime?</p>
<p>Like if you had some initial date: </p>
<pre><code>start_date = datetime.date(1847, 3, 30)
</code></pre>
<p>and simply wanted to change it to (1847, 3, 31)</p>
<p>and then (1847, 4, 1)</p>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>I'm new to Python and just trying to wrap my head around this import.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>startdate + datetime.timedelta(days=1) 
</code></pre>
<p>will give you the answer</p>
