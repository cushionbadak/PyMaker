<p>I'm newbie in python. Now I'm working with python related project. I saw following code while I am searching in google related to project.</p>
<pre><code>image = face_recognition.load_image_file("{}")
</code></pre>
<p>What does <code>"{}"</code> do inside <code>load_image_file()</code> function? Also, When and where should I use it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's hard to answer, without knowing more of how this method <code>load_image_file</code> works.  But here are 2 educated guesses which might be accurate:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>{}</code> would be an empty <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionary</a>.  Dictionaries are very important and useful in Python and work with key:value pairs.  For instance, the following would be a more useful dictionary than the empty one given:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>phone_nums = {'home': '867-5309', 'work': '555-1212'}</code> would create a dictionary that has 2 keys (<code>'home'</code> and <code>'work'</code>), which are associated with the 2 phone numbers.  For instance, <code>phone_nums['home']</code> would yield <code>867-5309</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>"{}"</code> would be a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSON representation</a> of an empty "Python dictionary". I put Python dictionary in quotes because a key aspect of the JSON representation is that it can "talk" across different languages.  You can write an object to a JSON structure in Python, then open it up in Javascript, or many other languages.  (I mention Javascript because that is where JSON originally comes from.)</p></li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>But back to your question of what it's doing in that method.  If I were to guess, I'd say that the method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looks for a string that is in a JSON representation.</li>
<li>Looks for some relevant key name in that representation, such as something like <code>'filename': 'C:\\Users\\my_file.jpeg'</code>.

<ul>
<li>If it cannot find the <code>'filename'</code> keyword, then it uses a default path.

<ul>
<li>In this case, that's what's happening, and what the author of that snippet of code wanted.  However, s/he couldn't simply pass <code>null</code> or an empty string, if indeed there was some requirement of a JSON representation of an object/dictionary.  That's all entirely conjecture, though.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>According to documentation:</p>
<pre><code>face_recognition.api.load_image_file(file, mode='RGB')[source]
Loads an image file (.jpg, .png, etc) into a numpy array

Parameters: 
file – image file name or file object to load
mode – format to convert the image to. Only ‘RGB’ (8-bit RGB, 3 channels) and ‘L’ (black and white) are supported.
Returns:    
image contents as numpy array
</code></pre>

<p>So you need to pas image path or object. <code>"{}"</code> sims incomplete code to me.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Right now, it is just a string that contains <code>{}</code> it depends on what your framework is doing with it. At the same time, dictionary's are defined with <code>{}</code>. Say <code>a = {}</code> will create a <code>dict object</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>{}</code> is also used in string formatting, to define a <code>set</code> or a <code>dict</code>... so many different meanings depending on the case...</span>
