<p>I practice python recently. for a few days my script has stopped, because I'm struggling on a problem.
I want to sort the items by both values which has in common. like an chain. as you can see lower.</p>
<p>what I have:</p>
<pre><code>dic= {'A': [62, 17], 'B': [59, 60], 'C': [60, 61], 'D': [57, 58], 'E': [61, 62], 'F': [58, 59]}
</code></pre>
<p>what I want:</p>
<pre><code>dic={'A': [62, 17], 'E': [31, 62],'C': [60, 31],'B': [3, 60],'F': [58, 3],'D': [57, 58]}
</code></pre>
<p>to see clearly:</p>
<pre><code>'A': [62, 17]

'E': [*31*, 62]

'C': [60, *31*]

'B': [3, 60]

'F': [58, 3]

'D': [57, 58]
</code></pre>
<p>there is a simple method to sort them ? if the topic already exists, 
can you send me the link. i haven't found it.
thank you in advance.
nb. in all case, I know the first and the last value of the chain (17 and 57)</p>

<p>Given what others have said about the order of a dictionary and violating the posters desire to have a dictionary, I return a sorted list.
I used the accepted answer at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012185/in-python-how-do-i-index-a-list-with-another-list">In Python, how do I index a list with another list?</a></p>
<pre><code>d= {'A': [62, 17], 'B': [59, 60], 'C': [60, 61], 'D': [57, 58], 'E': [61, 62], 'F': [58, 59]}
myList = [max(value) for key,value in d.items()]
print(myList)
myIndex = sorted(range(len(myList)),key=lambda x:myList[x],reverse=True)
L = [(key,value) for key,value in d.items()]
[L[i] for i in myIndex]

<p>in fact i don't need a new dictionary. but a ordered list by the common value of the item.
it must be look like that:
list=[17,62,32,60,3,58,57]</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can't sort dictionaries. Dictionaries are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">unordered key-value pairs</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have NO idea what rule you're using to sort that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But this is somehow more than sorting. Why do the values of <code>'B'</code> change?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should note that this is impossible in general (if I understand correctly what you're asking). Before anyone can provide a useful answer, you need to tell us more about these dictionaries. Is a unique sorting guaranteed? What happens if there are duplicates? This is a complex and fiddly problem; you need to tell us what assumptions we can make.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bilkokuya Yeah, I guess. If a dictionary contains only one element, you could <i>technically</i> say it's sorted. But in my opinion, that's really a stretch. If a data structure is sorted, then it's elements are put in a certain order. But a data structure with one element can only be put in one particular order, therefore you can't sort it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>[(key,value) for key,value in d.items()]</code> ==&gt; <code>list(d.items())</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">great ! thanks a lot ! that's exactly what I wanted. thanx</span>
