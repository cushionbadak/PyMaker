<p>I am able to search inside the text using the following condition:</p>
<pre><code>if search in text:
    print("Found")
else:
    print("Not Found")
</code></pre>
<p>But what I really need is to get all the news text related to let us say "Germany" starting from "germany's gabriel denies report ..." right upto "the post of finance minister" in case germany is found inside text.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to accomplish this feat?
A Thousand thanks in advance for all your answers.</p>

<p>It's ez but you should read about regex(regular expressions) cause i don't know the whole data structure:</p>
<pre><code>import re
search = input("Insert keyword")
text ="............."
if re.search(r'%s(.*?)\n\n'%(search),text,re.DOTALL) == None:
    print("Sorry did't found")
else:
    news = re.search(r'%s(.*?)\n\n'%(search),text,re.DOTALL).group()
    print(news)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of searching for <code>"Germany"</code>, search for <code>"German"</code> instead, to cover both cases. You may also need to convert everything to lowercase/uppercase to search sub strings of any case. </p>
<p>You can first get all of the substring locations with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.finditer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.finditer()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import re

search="German"

text = """germany's gabriel denies report he is eyeing finmin postberlin 
(reuters) - german foreign minister sigmar gabriel on saturday denied 
a report that said the social democrat, whose party has agreed to enter 
talks with chancellor angela merkel's conservatives on forming a coalition, 
was eyeing the post of finance minister."""

# converted to lowercase to making searching easier
sub_locs = [s.start() for s in re.finditer(search.lower(), text.lower())]
print(sub_locs)
</code></pre>
<p>Which will give:</p>
<pre><code>[0, 75]  
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can slice and add sub strings in <code>text</code> with respect to the indices from <code>sub_locs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>substrings = []
for start, end in zip(sub_locs[:-1], sub_locs[1:]):
    substrings.append(text[start:end])

# Get last substring
substrings.append(text[end:])

print("GERMAN SUBSTRINGS:")
for i, substr in enumerate(substrings):
    print("{0} -&gt; {1}\n".format(i + 1, substr))
</code></pre>
<p>Which outputs:</p>
<pre><code>GERMAN SUBSTRINGS

<span class="comment-copy">Is it correct to restate this as "I need to get each paragraph where <code>Germany</code> appears in the text"? If so, maybe you can just split your string by <code>"\n\n"</code> and get the elements that match? Or the regex-based answer below.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">let me try please.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry just edited mixed python :D</span>
