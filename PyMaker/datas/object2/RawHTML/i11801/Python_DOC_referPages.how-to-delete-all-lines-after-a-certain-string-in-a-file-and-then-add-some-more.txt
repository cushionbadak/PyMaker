<p>I want to delete all the lines in a file smart.txt and then add some strings of my own. smart.txt contains alot of lines.</p>
<p>I tried</p>
<pre><code>import sys
import os

output=[]
f= open(smart.txt, 'r')
for line in f:
 output.append(line)
 if '*** P R O P E R T I E S ***' in line: break
f=open(smart.txt, 'w')
[f.write(data) for data in output]
f.write('*** Inclusions ***\n ')
f.write('*** Permanent  ***\n ')
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>I am getting an error</p>
<pre><code>f= open(smart.txt, 'r')
NameError: name 'smart' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>cannot figure out because smart.txt is present in the same directory.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to use <code>'smart.txt'</code> instead of <code>smart.txt</code> when you're opening the file.
So you would change <code>f= open(smart.txt, 'r')</code> to <code>f= open('smart.txt', 'r')</code>.</p>
<p>Also you should use <code>with open('smart.txt', 'r') as f</code> to automatically close the file when you are done with it.</p>
