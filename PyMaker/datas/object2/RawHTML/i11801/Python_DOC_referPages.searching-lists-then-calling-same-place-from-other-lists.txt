<p>I wish for my program to search resident and if it a specific value it will print the same placed data from other lists. For example in this situation I would want it to print; </p>
<p>"Name is Alan, age is 7 and they do not live in place",</p>
<p>as well as,</p>
<p>"Name is Margaret, age is 66 and they do not live in place"</p>
<pre><code>name = ["Alan", "Susan", "Margaret"]
age = [7, 34, 66]
resident = [0, 1, 0]

if resident = 0:
    print ("name is {}, age is {} and they do not live in place".format(name[], age[]))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for person, ages, residency in zip(name,age,resident):
    if residency == 0:
        print("name is {0}, age is {1} and they do not live in place".format(person, ages))
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow"><code>zip</code></a> takes multiple lists and returns a list of tuples. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>zip(name, age, resident)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [('Alan', 7, 0), ('Susan', 34, 1), ('Margaret', 66, 0)]
</code></pre>
<p>Iterating over each tuple is then very easy. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Consider also the use of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow"><code>enumerate</code></a>, which will provide the index and item from the iterated list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i,x in enumerate(resident):
        if x == 0:
            print("name is {0}, age is {1} and they do not live in place".format(name[i], age[i]))


name is Alan, age is 7 and they do not live in place
name is Margaret, age is 66 and they do not live in place
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the commonly used <code>%s</code> string replacement:</p>
<pre><code>name = ["Alan", "Susan", "Margaret"]
age = [7, 34, 66]
resident = [0, 1, 0]

if resident[0] == 0:print ("name is %s, age is %s and they do not live in place"%(name[0],age[0]))
</code></pre>
