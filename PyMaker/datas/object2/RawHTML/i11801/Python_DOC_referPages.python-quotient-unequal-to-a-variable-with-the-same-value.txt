<p>Am working on a small math-checker using Python and everything works well except of divisions. 
Problem: The quotient with two decimals (2/3 = 0.67), float, is equal to an input (0.67). But the if-statement I use to compare a user's input with the result says it isn't equal. </p>
<p>Assumption: the problem is related to float. </p>
<p>My code:</p>
<pre><code>result = float(value0 / value1)
result = round(result,2)

value3 = input("Number 1")
value3 = float(value3)

if result != value3:
    print "Wrong!"
    print result
elif result == value:
    print "Right!"
</code></pre>
<p>Of course I could create a function with a different approach, but I am curious to understand why it doesn't work.</p>
<p>If there's a similar thread, please post the link and close this one. Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>when checking floats for equality <strong>always</strong> use</p>
<pre><code>equal_threshold = 1e-5
if abs(result-value)&lt;equal_threshold:

<span class="comment-copy">I suggest using the <code>decimal </code> module instead. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Rick: Thanks for the link. kindall: I refer to the rounded result of 2/3 with two decimals. So I know that there's a difference between 0.666666... (or 2/3) and 0.67.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, Joran. That's what I need.</span>
