<p>I am trying to define a simple function which checks if what the user placed into the arguments equal the letter B (No reason. Just made it B.) This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>def letter_check_B(letter):
    letter = str(letter)
    if letter == 'B':
        print("You entered B")
    else:
        print("You did not enter B")
</code></pre>
<p>However, when using the above code, by typing in:  </p>
<pre><code> letter_check_B(B)
</code></pre>
<p>I get an error stating:  </p>
<pre><code>NameError: name 'B' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>How would I go about to fix this without changing how the overall code works. I want to be able to make this code work by placing the letter into the argument (if that is possible).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can't use a plain <code>B</code> as a <em>value</em> in Python. The syntax will <em>always</em> see that as a variable reference. Since you haven't ever assigned anything to the name <code>B</code>, you get a <code>NameError</code> exception.</p>
<p>The <code>str()</code> function can only work on values; it'll work on an integer for example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; str(1)
'1'
</code></pre>
<p>You could create a string value with a string literal expression:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'B'
'B'
</code></pre>
<p>Passing that to the <code>str()</code> function is a no-op (the same string value is returned again):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; str('B')
'B'
</code></pre>
<p>but it'd make your function work nonetheless:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; letter_check_B('B')
You entered B
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <em>any</em> method you'd use to get user input, would return a value <em>anyway</em>. The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input()</code> function</a> for example, returns an object (value) of type <code>str</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; input('Enter a letter: ')
Enter a letter: B
'B'
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(_)  # what is the type of the value produced by the last expression?
&lt;class 'str'&gt;
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>B</code> is a <em>name</em> (the Python word for a variable); and <code>'B'</code> is a string with one character.</p>
<p>Since you didn't define <code>B</code>, Python is telling you that you are trying to pass a name that isn't defined.</p>
<p>Note the quotes <code>'B'</code> make a difference here. You need to pass a <em>string</em>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>letter_check_B('B')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Okay. Thanks for your answer. However, due to my actual code allowing both the use of letters and numbers to be inputted (which does different things), is there a way for a letter to be placed in without the speech marks? Also I do not want to use a global variable and assign the user input to that variable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Yuxie: the <i>user</i> of your program doesn't use quotes to enter a letter. They are not writing code. Look closely at my use of <code>input()</code>; there are no quotes around the <code>B</code> entered.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Yuxie: instead, your code will have to see if what was entered could possibly be a number. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/354038">How do I check if a string is a number (float) in Python?</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/379906">Parse String to Float or Int</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright. So i'm taking there are no way to do everything I am trying to do in just one definition, and that I must first ask for the input before using it in my defined function. And yes. I have already worked on a code which utilises ''.isdigit() and int() to parse a string to an int. Thanks for your answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Yuxie: That depends on what you are trying to do. Of course you can pass any value to your function as long as the conversion to a string will work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for the answer. Is there a way to just allow the user to type in B without the ' '? Maybe using input()?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just use input, like this: <code>user_letter = input('Please enter a letter: ')</code>, and the user can type <code>B</code> (without quotes); and it will be stored in <code>user_letter</code> as a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">okay. Thanks for the answer. I'll go about to try implement that instead.</span>
