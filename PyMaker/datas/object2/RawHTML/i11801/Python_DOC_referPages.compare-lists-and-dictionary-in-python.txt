<p>My query is to fetch each item in the list compare with the key of the dictionary and fetch its value.</p>

<p>The error I am facing is the element from the list is:</p>

key from dictionary: 'a,b'

<p>give try-except a shot and bypass any mismatches without generating an error. Use the search functionality of dictionaries - myDictionary[KeyToSearchFor] ouputs the value, if any.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">First snippet is not a valid Python code... And <code>a,b == ["a", "b"]</code> is false, why should it match? String can never be equal to list, why should it be? <code>a,b == ','.join(['a', 'b'])</code> may be true, but since you are not doing this conversion yourself, why Python should guess that's what you want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rogalski, actually it is a python code but jus a test snippet and could you pl explain what i am doing wrong more clearly</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have no idea why you are using a loop to look up items in a dictionary. Perhaps consult <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SurajDavey you seem to not understand what <code>dict</code> is. It is a hash table. That means you can search for keys like <code>d[key]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CPanda I get that, but still  not able to hash it because of difference mentioned in my question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note - it's generally not a good idea to have a generic <code>except</code> statement, as it can mask over other problems in the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I do agree but you could certainly expand it so that it doesn't mask other problems. But yes...you are 100% correct sir</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Signal Can you explain the down vote?</span>
