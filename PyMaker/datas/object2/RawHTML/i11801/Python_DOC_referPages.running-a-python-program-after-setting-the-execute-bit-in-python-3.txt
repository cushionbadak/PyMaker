<p>I was going through <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/set-up#download-google-python-exercises" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google's Python instructions</a> and it quotes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The commands above are the simplest way to run python programs. If the
  "execute bit" is set on a .py file, it can be run by name without
  having to type "python" first. Set the execute bit with the "chmod"
  command like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where it proceeds to give me this code to run on my terminal: </p>
<pre><code>~/google-python-exercises$ chmod +x hello.py
~/google-python-exercises$ ./hello.py   ## now can run it as ./hello.py
Hello World
</code></pre>
<p>However when I type in <code>./hello.py</code>, I get: </p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4IpGp.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4IpGp.png"/></a></p>
<p>So is this something to do with me using <strong>Python 3</strong> when this could be a command for <strong>Python 2</strong>?  </p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>I just realised that this can only be run on a Linux/Mac. How does one go about doing this on a Windows? </p>

<p>You need to associate the file extension with Python properly. This should happen by default if you install system wide (which requires administrator privileges), but if you're using a third party distribution, it's not guaranteed, and it may require a reboot even so.</p>
<p>For more details running Python on Windows, see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html" rel="nofollow">Python on Windows docs</a>. It looks like if you omitted the launcher from your Python install, it won't have registered the file extensions; it may be worth reinstalling properly to fix that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you can't get file extension associations working, just run:</p>
<pre><code>python hello.py
</code></pre>
<p>or starting with 3.3 and later, you can use:</p>
<pre><code>py hello.py
</code></pre>
<p>which lets you provide an argument to <code>py.exe</code> to change which installed version of Python to use (if desired).</p>
<p>You wouldn't use <code>./hello.py</code> on Windows at all, because that's the wrong directory separator (Windows sometimes allows forward slashes, but in DOS prompts, that looks like trying to launch a program named <code>.</code> with the switch <code>/hello.py</code>). You'd use plain <code>hello.py</code> (Windows always searches the current working directory) or <code>.\hello.py</code> if you want to be explicit.</p>

<p>Do you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)" rel="nofollow">shebang</a> as the first line in <code>hello.py</code>?</p>
<p>something like:
<code>#!/usr/bin/env python3</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>python hello.py</code> assuming the python path is in your environment variables</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JamesBuck Yeah, I'm aware of executing the program in that manner, but I just wanted to know how to simply execute it with a <code>./hello.py</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then search for <code>Default Programs</code> in windows and then associate the .py extension with python.exe.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SharanDuggirala: Well, just to be clear, <code>./hello.py</code> is never going to work (because it looks like trying to launch a program named <code>.</code> with the switch <code>/hello.py</code>. On Windows, you'd just do <code>hello.py</code> or <code>.\hello.py</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But I have downloaded and installed <i>python</i> from the official website.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SharanDuggirala: If you didn't install Python for the system, only per-user, then it won't have installed the launcher or registered the file associations. You'd need to run the installer as an Administrator and install the launcher to register the associations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just typing in <code>hello.py</code> worked thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OP is running on Windows, shebang lines don't do much there (though with the 3.3+ launcher, they're read to determine the default version of Python to launch for that script).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oops, you are right @ShadowRanger. I'm not familiar with how it works on windows.</span>
