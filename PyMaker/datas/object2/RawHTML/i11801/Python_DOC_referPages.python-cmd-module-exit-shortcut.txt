<p>Using python <code>cmd</code> module, I would like to be able to quit the command line application using Ctrl+D. However, default behavior prints <code>^D</code> instead of quitting the application.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html" rel="nofollow">Reading the documentation</a>, I can't seem to find a way to do it. Any hints ?</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html" rel="nofollow">doc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An end-of-file on input is passed back as the string 'EOF'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which means that <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> is dispatched to the <code>do_EOF()</code> method. So to give a way to exit your interpreter, make sure to implement <code>do_EOF()</code> and have it return <code>True</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def do_EOF(self, line):
    return True
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Sorry for the late comment. When I type <code>Ctrl+D</code> it just prints <code>^D</code>. Using <code>Ctrl+C</code> exits the application, but without calling do_EOF. Any hints ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Overdrivr: Have you overriden any of <code>Cmd</code>'s methods? If yes, you'd need to post the relevant code; if not, <code>Ctrl+D</code> should work after you add the above <code>do_EOF</code> method to your <code>Cmd</code> subclass (I've just tested it myself and it works).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good point, hitting Ctrl+D should raise a KeyboardInterrupt or SystemExit exception is this correct ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Overdrivr: <code>EOFError</code>, I guess. But this is catched and handled by <code>cmd</code> anyway (by dispatching to <code>do_EOF()</code>).</span>
