<p>I am comfortable with Java naming conventions where you are free to name your methods as long as it starts with lowercase so <code>methodForTest()</code> is acceptable. </p>
<p>However, Python (PyCharm IDE) complains for this way and it requires all lowercase.</p>
<p>Why? Can I disable this so I can use uppercase in method naming?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python has <em>no such limitation</em>.</p>
<p>Python identifiers must start with an underscore or letter (upper or lowercase), followed by any number of underscores, digits or letters (again, upper or lowercase, doesn't matter); this means an ALL_UPPERCASE name is perfectly valid Python. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="noreferrer"><em>Identifiers and keywords</em></a> section in the reference documentation; Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="noreferrer">expanded on this by allowing a wider range of Unicode</a>.</p>
<p>However, the widely adopted <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008" rel="noreferrer">PEP 8 Python styleguide</a> does have this to say on <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-names" rel="noreferrer">naming functions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a <em>convention</em> however, not a syntactic requirement. Perhaps your IDE has a linter installed that warns when you break this convention. You can, if you so wish, ignore it. I note that <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2013/02/long-awaited-pep-8-checks-on-the-fly-improved-doctest-support-and-more-in-pycharm-2-7/" rel="noreferrer">PyCharm implements such a check</a>, for example.</p>
<p>In PyCharm, you can click on the warning icon and tell PyCharm to ignore the class of errors:</p>
<p><img alt="PyCharm *Ignore errors like this* option" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oDyNv.png"/></p>
<p>Also see the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2016.1/suppressing-inspections.html?origin=old_help" rel="noreferrer">PyCharm documentation on suppressing inspections</a>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python is really permissive (too much maybe) and let's you do almost whatever you want.</p>
<p>You can name your classes, methods, variables, the way you want. You can access every variable of an instance, there is not public / private concept.</p>
<p>Pycharm / IntelliJ is just warning you but does not FORCE you to follow PEP8, however, this is Python, not Java, and PEP8 should be followed as much as possible.</p>
<p>Python is all about <strong><em>readability over fanciness</em></strong>, for example:</p>
<pre><code>[x for x if a_list if x == 1]
</code></pre>
<p>is preferable to</p>
<pre><code>map(lambda x: x == 1, a_list)
</code></pre>
<p>as well as</p>
<pre><code>class MySuperAwesomeClass:
    pass

def my_super_function():
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>is preferable to</p>
<pre><code>class my_super_awesome_class:
    pass

def mySuperFunction()
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>This way, especially in a team of developers or in an open source project with multiple contributors, there is a kind of convention which everybody follows to make others life 
easier.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can create a method with an uppercase letter. You are just getting a warning because it goes against the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8</a> style guide.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's completely allowed. It's just discouraged, like naming a java method <code>method_for_test</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And yes, of course you can configure it.</span>
