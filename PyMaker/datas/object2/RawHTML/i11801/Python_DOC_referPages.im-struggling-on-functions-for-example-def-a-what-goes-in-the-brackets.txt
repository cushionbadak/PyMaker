<p>I'm new to programming and I recently started Python (3) in school. I'm having trouble understanding Functions. I've read some examples of Functions for example: def a (...). I understand "def" defines the functions and a names it, but I don't know what goes in the brackets, I heard its a parameter but when I Google it this comes up:</p>
<p>What is a parameter in computing? In computer programming, a parameter is a special kind of variable, used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine. These pieces of data are called arguments.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Arguments, parameters, or input variables go within the brackets. These can be thought of as pieces of data you pass to a function for use within that function.</p>
<p>For (a very basic) example: </p>
<pre><code>def plus_five(num):
    my_other_number = num + 5
    return my_other_number
</code></pre>
<p>This function would take in a number and <strong>within the scope of this function</strong> that number would be known as <code>num</code>. A new variable that exists only within this function would be created, named <code>my_other_number</code>, initialized to the value of the input <code>num</code> plus 5. </p>
<p>The function then returns the value of <code>my_other_number</code>.</p>
<p>In usage it would look something like:</p>
<pre><code>my_num = 10
returned_number = plus_five(my_num)
print(my_num)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 10
print(returned_number)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 15
</code></pre>
<p>Think of an argument like you would the variable of a mathematical function:</p>
<pre><code>f(x) = x+5
f(10) = 10+5 = 15
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try with an actual simple example:</p>
<pre><code>def sumthis(a,b):
    return a+b

c = sumthis(3,2)
print(c)
</code></pre>
<p>, a function to sum two numbers. The result (print sends stuff to the console so you are able to see) is: 5</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Functions in programming are similar to functions in algebra. In algebra, functions are represented as <code>f(x)</code>. In programming, they are defined using code but the representation is the same.<br/>
So if <code>f(x) = x^2</code> in algebra, in python, it will be:</p>
<pre><code>def f(x):
    return x**2
</code></pre>
<p>And in algebra, <code>f(2) = 4</code>. So, in python <code>f(2)</code> will return 4.</p>

<p>What will probably help you the most is using google in a slightly different manner. Try searching for definitions of things such as:</p>
<pre><code>define: programming argument
define: programming parameter
</code></pre>
<p>these two examples, when searched on google, each line separately, will show you a definition of each term. Any time you use "define" first on google, it will search a definition of the term or phrase that follows.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please start with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Tutorial</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks but can you tell me what an argument or a parameter does? Whenever I google it the definition contains other programming terms which I am not aware of.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've just added a quick little example that hopefully should explain somewhat what an argument is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot! So is this it summarized? 'plus_five' is the name of the function and 'num' is the name of the variable? Oh and also did you make a mistake on the second program because you typed 'my_num' instead of 'num' or are they two completely different programs?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you are correct about the name of the function and the name of the passed in variable. However, the names do not have to match. <code>num</code> in function declaration is just what that data will be called will within that function. That data is called <code>my_num</code> in the main area. It can be a bit tricky, but they both reference the same thing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So it's an input variable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Programmer 2 Exactly! You input 3 and 5 to the function. In this case it will be returned the sum of both numbers to a third variable you might call output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">We haven't learn anything about f(2) in Maths yet, does it basically square the number? Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You haven't learned functions in algebra yet? <code>f(2)</code> basically replaces <code>x</code> with <code>2</code> in <code>f(x)</code> and since <code>f(x)</code> returns square of <code>x</code>, <code>f(2)</code> will return square of 2. If <code>f(x) = x^3</code>, then it will return cube, and so on depending on what <code>f(x)</code> is defined as.</span>
