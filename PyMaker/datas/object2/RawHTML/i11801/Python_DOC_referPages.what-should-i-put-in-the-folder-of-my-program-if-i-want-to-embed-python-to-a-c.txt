<p>I wrote a program with Qt and I embedded a <code>.py</code> file in it to do some work.</p>
<p>On my computer which has the Python interpreter installed, the program can run correctly, but when I run it on my roommate's PC, which has <strong>NO</strong> Python interpreter installed, the program crashed. </p>
<p>The part which is written with Qt runs well but when I push a button to call <code>.py</code> to do some work, the program crashes.</p>
<p>I think the problem is that I haven't put the std library and some other key files of Python into the folder of my program, but I have no idea what files should I pack into it.</p>
<p>So if the problem is really what I thought, what should I do to solve it? </p>
<p>Namely, <strong>which files of Python should be packaged into a program to run on the PC with no Python interpreter ?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>------------update------------------<br/>
As for the code of Python, it's just a hello-world for test and learning. I copy the whole Python34 folder into the program and the question has been solved:). Though it may not be a right way, it works.</p>

<p>Python's documentation has a reference manual for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html#c-api-index" rel="nofollow">C/C++ API</a>.
The file I believe you're referring to is <code>Python.h</code>, though I'm no expert on this. It's considerably easier to embed C than C++, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> gives some of the more simple examples. As far as I know, you shouldn't need to worry about the interpreter for compiling to an executable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just required that your users have Python installed.  Also, be wary of packaging it with your project - there might be licensing issues.</span>
