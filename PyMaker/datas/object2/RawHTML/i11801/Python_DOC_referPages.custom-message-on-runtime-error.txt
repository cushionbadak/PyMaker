<p>Is it possible to add a Custom Message globally on runtime-erros? I would like to have a time-stamp as this would help figuring out if a file eventually was written by that execution process.</p>

<p>Replacing <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.excepthook" rel="nofollow"><code>sys.excepthook</code></a> with an appropriate function will allow you to do whatever you like upon every occurrence of an uncaught exception.</p>

<p>Take a look at the Python docs (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">2</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">3</a>) on handling exceptions. You can catch the RuntimeError and print the original message along with a custom timestamp.

<p>Ignacio's solution is also great if you'd like to set the message globally.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean when the RuntimeError exception is raised? If so can't you just catch that at the top level of your process and do whatever you want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thats what i was looking for, are there any downsides doing that?</span>
