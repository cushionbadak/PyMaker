<p>I'm a beginner in Python and I'm reading from a file with the content:</p>

<p>As you can see it's almost a json-file but with additional characters like: [\ .</p>
<p><strong>Task</strong>: Formate content of the file so I can access separate quotes and print out random quotes. </p>
<p>I could try something like this</p>
<pre><code>jsonfile = open(INPUT, "r")
jsonobject = json.load(jsonfile)
someString = "\n\"{quotes}\"\n".format(quotes=jsonobject["quotes"])
</code></pre>
<p>which will get rid of {quotes:} from the string. Though additional unwanted characters remain and I have tried using <code>string.replace</code> separately and in a loop but it doesn't give me the result I want.</p>
<p>Example: <code>holder = someString.replace("[\]", '')</code></p>
<p>After the formatting is done I guess I should use a loop and try the random module with <code>random.string</code>?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have valid JSON data <em>already</em>. <code>\"</code> is an escaped quote (so it is part of the string value), and <code>[...]</code> is a JSON <em>array</em> (analogous to a Python list).</p>

<p>In the above demo I used the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow"><code>random.choice()</code> function</a> to pick one of the quotes from the list at random.</p>
<p>The only thing missing is Marvin's lullaby, my favourite of all Marvin's utterings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the world has gone to bed<br/>
  Darkness won't engulf my head<br/>
  I can see by infra-red<br/>
  How I hate the night</p>
<p>Now I lay me down to sleep<br/>
  Try to count electric sheep<br/>
  Sweet dream wishes you can keep<br/>
  How I hate the night</p>

<p>This should work as is.</p>
<pre><code>import json
import random
file = open(&lt;path to your file&gt;,'r')
i = json.load(file)
#print a random quote
print i['quotes'][int(random.randrange(0,len(i['quotes'])-1))]

<span class="comment-copy">Actually... that is valid json that gives you a dict with a list of quotes. For instance, <code>data["quotes"][0]</code> is <code>"I could calculate your ch ance of survival, but you won't like it."</code>. You get those ` \ ` escape characters because the json strings have embeded strings.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">BTW, its great to see that you have quotes from some of the world's greatest literature.</span>
