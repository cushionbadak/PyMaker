<p>I have a simple python script that gets the text of a tweet. </p>
<p>However, emojis are somehow encoded, so they look like this in the output \xf0\x9f\x90\xa3.</p>
<p>Is there a way to find out what emoji this is from this output?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Odds are it's UTF-8 encoded (along with the rest of the data, it's just that ASCII text happens to be be rendered identically in ASCII and UTF-8).</p>
<p>If you have a <code>bytes</code> like <code>b'\xf0\x9f\x90\xa3'</code>, you'd just do:</p>
<pre><code>b = b'\xf0\x9f\x90\xa3'
txt = b.decode('utf-8')
</code></pre>
<p>If you received it as a <code>str</code>, this is probably a mistaken decoding as <code>latin-1</code> or some other code page, so just undo it and redo with UTF-8:</p>
<pre><code>b = '\xf0\x9f\x90\xa3'
txt = b.encode('latin-1').decode('utf-8')
# If it's not latin-1, could be sys.getdefaultencoding()
</code></pre>
<p>Which gets an ordinal of 0x1f423 (my computer can't display it, or I'd have added it here), which is in the correct range for most of the emoji. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36335848/decoding-emojis-from-tweets-in-python-3/36336015#comment60293884_36335848">As noted in the comments</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html" rel="nofollow"><code>unicodedata</code></a> reports the character as a <a href="http://emojipedia.org/hatching-chick/" rel="nofollow"><code>HATCHING CHICK</code></a>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>import unicodedata; print(unicodedata.name(b"\xf0\x9f\x90\xa3".decode('utf-8')))</code> says <code>HATCHING CHICK</code>. Ist's hard to say more without knowing what exactly your script doing...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mata It sounds like he's getting the text of a tweet and the emojis are being displayed as <code>\xf0\x9f\x90\xa3</code>, so it sounds like he wants to know what emoji that actually is...</span>
