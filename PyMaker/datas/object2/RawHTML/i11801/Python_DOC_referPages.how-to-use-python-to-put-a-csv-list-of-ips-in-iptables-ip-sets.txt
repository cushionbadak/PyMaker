<p>I would like to use <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/client9/ipcat/master/datacenters.csv" rel="nofollow">this CSV file</a> to block all IPs from the list. The entries in the CSV file are IP ranges. How do I seperate the IP ranges from text, and add those IP ranges to the <code>iptables</code> with the rule to drop all connections with those IPs.</p>
<p>Btw, I think this is better to use for large ip ranges, <a href="http://ipset.netfilter.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://ipset.netfilter.org/index.html</a> </p>

<p>You will need python <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netaddr" rel="nofollow">netaddr</a> module for that</p>
<pre><code>import netaddr

with open('ipranges.txt','r') as f:
    for line in f:
        startip,endip=line.split(',')[:2]
        print 'iptables -I INPUT -s {} -j DROP'.format(netaddr.iprange_to_cidrs(startip, endip)[0])
</code></pre>

<p>maybe take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html</a> to manipulate your ip addresses. ipaddress.summarize_address_range(first, last) could be nice to generate the iptables rule.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">so I download the csv file, change the file extension from csv to txt, and then I execute that script en every IP range in that file will be added to the IP Tables?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Firstly, you need to install netaddr module. Then lauch a script - just change filename to the actual file you have. It will print out a bunch of netfilter rules. Then you just pass them to bash.</span>
