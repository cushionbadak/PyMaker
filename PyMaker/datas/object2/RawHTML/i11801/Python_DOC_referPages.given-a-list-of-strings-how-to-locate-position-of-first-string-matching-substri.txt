<p>I have the body of an email parsed into a list of strings (each line is a string). Emails that are replies will have a section along the bottom that is repeating the prior email and begin with " &gt; ", like this....</p>
<pre><code>Hi Dude,

This is just an example.

&gt; The prior email text
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like to run some text analytics on the message using NLP, but would like to drop the junk at the bottom first. I imagine what I want to use is the <strong>re</strong> module, find the following line via regex:</p>
<pre><code>On Fri, Apr 1, 2016 at 10:14 AM, Some Dude (somedude@example.com)
</code></pre>
<p>And once I have the location, slice the list to that position. But I'm having trouble locating the position of that line. There's probably sexier ways to write this, but here's what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>pattern = r'\AOn +([A-Z]+[a-z]{2}), +([A-Z]+[a-z]{2}) +([1-31])'
indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(text) if re.search(pattern, x)]
</code></pre>
<p>I presume my issue is in my regex pattern (which does appear valid and does match the line in places like <a href="https://www.regex101.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.regex101.com/</a>, but I'm stuck there as indices is returning an empty set <code>[]</code>. In the example text provided above, I'd like it to return 4 (the 5th line).</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>enumerate(text)</code> is an iterator over characters of <code>text</code>. Since you want to find the line number, you'll have to iterate over lines. For example, you could split <code>text</code> into individual lines using <code>str.split('\n')</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [i for i, x in enumerate(text.split('\n')) if x and re.search(pattern, x)]
[4]
</code></pre>
<p>Considering that you only need to find the first matching line, it's possible to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow"><code>next</code></a> and a generator expression like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; next(i for i, x in enumerate(text.split('\n')) if x and re.search(pattern, x))
4
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>To get the rest of the text you could concatenate the "remainder" of the iterator:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; it = enumerate(text.split('\n'))
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(i for i, x in it if x and re.search(pattern, x))
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; '\n'.join(x for _, x in it)
'\n&gt; The prior email text\n'
</code></pre>
<p>or alter the regular expression to match the whole line:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; match = re.search(r'On +([A-Z]+[a-z]{2}), +([A-Z]+[a-z]{2}) +([1-31]).*?\n', text)
&gt;&gt;&gt; text[match.end():] # Don't forget to check if match is None
'\n&gt; The prior email text\n'
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>You'd avoid using regex, especially if all you need to find is the position of the <code>&gt;</code> character.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; text[text.index('&gt;'):]
'&gt; The prior email text\n'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would tackle this problem different. Iterate over all the lines. </p>
<p>Start with <code>junk_begins = -1</code><br/>
When you see a line starting with <code>&gt;</code> (no need for a regex, just use <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_startswith.htm" rel="nofollow">startsWith</a>), set <code>junk_begins</code> to the current line <code>if junk_begins == -1</code>.<br/>
When you see a line starting WITHOUT <code>&gt;</code>, set <code>junk_begins</code> back to <code>-1</code></p>
<p>After looping through all the lines, you will have <code>junk_begins</code> pointing to the line number of the first line where every line afterwards starts with <code>&gt;</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>No regex required. Before you make the list(consume the iterator, I mean) filter it,</p>
<pre><code>cleaned = [line for line in source if not line.lstrip().startswith("&gt;")]
</code></pre>
<p>See if it woks.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This works, but as a follow-up, how would I slice the original body text given the specific line number determined here given that text is just a single string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tim_schaaf: edited.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So, this definitely works, I just had to adjust the start of count for the empty row.</span>
