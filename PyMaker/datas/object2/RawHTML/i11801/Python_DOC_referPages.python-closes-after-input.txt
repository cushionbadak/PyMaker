<p>I'm brand new to python! My programs keep closing immediately after I input some data. So for example, I run this:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
  kilometers = eval(input("How many kilometers do you want to convert to miles?"))
  miles = kilometers * 0.62
  print(kilometers, "kilometers is", miles, "miles!")
main()
</code></pre>
<p>And after I put in a number, the program shuts down without displaying an answer. It works just fine on my school's computers. How can I fix this?</p>

<p>You've probably used Python 3 on your school's computers. On Python 2 <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input</code></a> already does <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow"><code>eval</code></a> on the input that user entered where as on Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input</code></a> just returns a string that needs to be converted to number in one way or another.</p>
<p>If you want to convert the example to work on Python 2 I'd suggest that you use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#raw_input" rel="nofollow"><code>raw_input</code></a> that returns the user input as a string and convert it to number with <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#float" rel="nofollow"><code>float</code></a>. You also need to either use <code>print</code> statement or import <code>print</code> function from <code>__future__</code> as I've done in the following example:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function

def main():
    kilometers = float(raw_input("How many kilometers do you want to convert to miles?"))
    miles = kilometers * 0.62

    print(kilometers, "kilometers is", miles, "miles!")

main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your program exits immediately after input. You can block it simply with a "raw_input()" at the end. If you're using Python 2.7 (as opposed to 3.x) you should use raw_input() instead of input(). Using eval is a bit strange here, so let's use a float. Finally as this is tagged Python 2.7, I made the print use a formatted string because it feels more 2.7-like:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
  kilometers = float(raw_input("How many kilometers do you want to convert to miles? "))
  miles = kilometers * 0.62
  print "%f kilometers is %f miles!" % (kilometers, miles)
main()
raw_input()
</code></pre>
<p>Now your program will exit after you hit Enter!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why use <code>eval</code> when you're not expecting an expression? Have you the put the same input on your computer as you have on the school computer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">like i said, I'm brand new at this. I literally just picked up a book on it two days ago. This is the same code i put into python at my school and it works, but on my laptop, the program just closes immediately</span>
