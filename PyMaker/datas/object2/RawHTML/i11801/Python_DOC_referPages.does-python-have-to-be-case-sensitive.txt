<p>When a user inputs a command using:</p>
<pre><code>input()
</code></pre>
<p>Is it possible within python to make it so that <strong>the case</strong> in which they enter the command <strong>does not</strong> matter?</p>
<p>eg:</p>
<pre><code>print("Do you Shout? Look? Continue?")
action1 = input()
if action1 == "Continue":
</code></pre>
<p>Can I make it so that if they enter "continue" (in lower case) this section of code will still work? Thanks in advance for responses!</p>

<p>I would suggest sticking with a single case when checking. So you should use "continue". Keep it all using a single case (in this case lower case), by using either <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower" rel="nofollow">lower()</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.upper" rel="nofollow">upper()</a> to control the casing, to ensure your conditions are matched exactly as you expect. </p>
<pre><code>print("Do you Shout? Look? Continue?")
action1 = input()
if action1.lower() == "continue":
    # do things
</code></pre>
</div>
