<p>I'm unable to figure out why I am getting an infinite loop ??</p>
<p>Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code># LAB  -   FIND SUM OF NUMBERS   1-10,  20-37,  35-89
sum = 0
i = 0
sum += i
for i in range(1,11):
    print('sum from 1-10 is ' ,sum)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This will do what you want:</p>
<pre><code>mysum = 0 
for i in range(1,11):
    mysum += i

print('sum from 1-10 is ' ,mysum)
</code></pre>
<p>Also possible:</p>
<pre><code>mysum = sum(range(11))
print('sum from 1-10 is ' , mysum)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're getting the loop wrong.</p>
<p>Here's a pythonic way of summing number between 1 and 10:</p>
<pre><code>sum(range(11))
sum(range(20,38))
sum(range(35,90))
</code></pre>
<p>edited: according to @bereal and @l4mpi comments</p>
<p>Here's a less pythonic way of achieving the same:</p>
<pre><code>mysum = 0
for i in range(1,11):
    mysum += i
print mysum
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You're not getting infinite loop but your code simply doesn't do what it should.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you sum addition is outside of the loop but must be inside</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How are you deciding on what range to sum?  Your homework assignment has 3 ranges.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You shouldn't overwrite the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code></a> built-in.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matthias you are right. edited</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why not just <code>sum(range(1, 11))</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or even <code>sum(range(11))</code> - the <code>0</code> doesn't matter for the sum.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@l4mpi right ! Just giving him a hint for the <code>20-37</code> and <code>35-89</code>.</span>
