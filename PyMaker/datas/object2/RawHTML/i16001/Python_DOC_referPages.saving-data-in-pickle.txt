<p>I am using python to code and I have read online to use the pickle method to save games but I don't know how it works. I am trying to save my top score into a txt document so next time access the program the top score is saved.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>OK, quick example. Say you have your top scores saved in a dict:</p>
<pre><code>top_scores = {10000: "Joey", 8000: "Mary", 6000: "Tommy", 4000: "Susie", 2000: "Bobby"}
</code></pre>
<p>All you do to pickle it to disk is:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

with open("top_scores.pickle", "wb") as scores:
    pickle.dump(top_scores, scores)
</code></pre>
<p>If you later want to unpickle the data, simply do this:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

with open("top_scores.pickle", "rb") as scores:
    top_scores = pickle.load(scores)
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, there's much more you can do, but this should get you started.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes but I don't know what sterilization is</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it's <code>serialization</code>. Read about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization" rel="nofollow noreferrer">on Wikipedia</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so would I do <code>pickle.dump(top_score)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I LOLd at "yes but I don't know what sterilization is"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry forgot to copy. <b>This error</b> <code>line 354, in &lt;module&gt;     pickle.dump(top_score, score) io.UnsupportedOperation: write</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am confused were to put this code <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/view/poglq29jg0tsivl/wah.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">my code:</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Lioninn22 you need to switch the <code>"rb"</code> and <code>"wb"</code> parameters. You need to open the file in write-binary mode (<code>wb</code>) for writing using <code>pickle.dump()</code>, and in read-binary mode (<code>rb</code>) for reading using <code>pickle.load()</code>. Also, make sure your top scores are actually stored in a variable called <code>top_score</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when I do that i get this error <code>with QUIT("top_score.pickle", "wb") as scores: TypeError: 'int' object is not callable</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Lioninn22 why are you using <code>with QUIT(...)</code>?</span>
