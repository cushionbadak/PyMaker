<p>I need a data structure to store the following data (I am using a dictionary to represent it): </p>
<pre><code>{  {1:{2:3.4,  3:5.6,  4:7.8}},
   {2:{3:6.4,  4:66.6, 5:64.8}} ,
   {3:{4:33.4, 5:5.46, 6:72.8}} 
} 
</code></pre>
<p>How do I represent such data in Python? </p>
<p>Currently I have this data in lists:</p>
<pre><code>A = [[3.4,5.6,7.8], [6.4,66.6,64.8], [33.4,5.46,72.8]]
</code></pre>
<p>representing the value for each key. For example, the first list in <code>A</code> contains value for Item1 with respective Item2, Item3, Item4 (which again need to be a key(nested)). Same way the second list representing the value for Item2 with respect to Item3, Item4, Item5.</p>
<p>I am new to Python, so I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.</p>

<p>What you're showing there is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-set" rel="nofollow"><code>set</code></a> of 1-item dictionaries - which can't exist in Python, because the elements of sets must be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable" rel="nofollow">hashable</a>, and dictionaries aren't. However, a dictionary of dictionaries is perfectly straightforward to create:</p>
<pre><code>{
    1: {2: 3.4, 3: 5.6, 4: 7.8},
    2: {3: 6.4, 4: 66.6, 5: 64.8},
    3: {4: 33.4, 5: 5.46, 6: 72.8}
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the individual items in the outer dictionary aren't enclosed in braces.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What you've shown isn't a dictionary of dictionaries, it's a <i>set</i> of dictionaries of dictionaries.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or, if you really did want the top level to be a sequence of 1-element dictionaries of dictionaries, you could put them in a list instead of a set… or a <code>sortedcollection.SortedCollection</code> or a <code>sortedcontainers.SortedList</code> or anything else that doesn't require immutable/hashable elements… but yeah, this is probably what the OP wants.</span>
