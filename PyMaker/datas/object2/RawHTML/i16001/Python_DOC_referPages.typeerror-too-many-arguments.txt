<p>When running this code it appears with an error that there are too many arguments in line 8. I'm unsure on how to fix it.</p>
<pre><code>#Defining a function to raise the first to the power of the second.
def power_value(x,y):

##Testing 'power_value' function
#Getting the users inputs
x = int(input("What is the first number?\n"))
y = int(input("What power would you like to raise",x,"to?\n"))

#Printing the result
print (x,"to the power of",y,"is:",power_value(x,y))

<p>Resulting in a TypeError...</p>
<pre><code>     Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>The issue is that the python input() function was only ready to accept one parameter - the prompt string, but you passed in three. To solve this issue, you just need to combine all three pieces into one.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>%</code> operator to format string:</p>
<pre><code>y = int(input("What power would you like to raise %d to?\n" %x,))
</code></pre>
<p>Or use the new way:</p>
<pre><code>y = int(input("What power would you like to raise {0} to?\n".format(x)))
</code></pre>
<p>You can find the document <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Change your <code>y</code> input line to </p>
<pre><code>y = int(input("What power would you like to raise" + str(x) + "to?\n"))
</code></pre>
<p>So you will concatenate the three substrings into a single string.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you need to specify <code>x</code> variable :</p>
<p>using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow">format</a></p>
<pre><code>y = int(input("What power would you like to raise {}to?\n".format(x)))
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>y = int(input("What power would you like to raise %d to?\n"%x)))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>input</code> accepts <strong>one</strong> argument which it prints to the screen. You can read about <code>input()</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">here</a>
In your case you are providing 3 arguments to it -&gt;</p>
<ol>
<li>The String <code>"What power would you like to raise"</code></li>
<li>The integer <code>x</code></li>
<li>The String <code>"to?\n"</code></li>
</ol>
<p>You can combine these three things together like this and form one argument </p>
<pre><code>y = int(input("What power would you like to raise"+str(x)+"to?\n"))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, it just I'm not to sure on how the '%' operator works</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes I have used comas to separate them when it should be like that. Thanks :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, it shouldn't be like that. Use <code>format</code> as others suggested.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matthias "it shouldn't"? Why is that? It works fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It works, but it lacks flexibility. With <code>format</code> you can control the result much better. Additionally: In your example you're missing the blanks around the number. Using a format-string you would see it at once.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please provide more context to the answer. Moreover, i still see syntax errors in the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oops, updated the answer now</span>
