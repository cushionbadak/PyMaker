<p>So I was playing around with <code>dir()</code> function. I ran a simple <code>dir(builtins)</code> function which gave me a list of defined names. What was unexpected is when I ran this just to fool around:</p>
<pre><code>dir('\nbuiltins')
</code></pre>
<p>This gave a me a entirely different list of names. Can someone explain what is going on? :) thanks!</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir" rel="nofollow"><code>dir</code></a> returns names of attributes of the given object.</p>
<p><code>'\nbuiltins'</code> is a string literal. So you get attribute names of the string object.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I see, so any string literal I type in the <code>dir</code> function will give me the same list. Basically its returning me all of the attributes/methods I can perform on a string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bLunt, You're right. Likewise you will get same list for <code>dir([])</code>, <code>dir([1])</code>, <code>dir([1] + [2, 3, 4])</code>, .... ; which all return attribute names for <code>list</code>.</span>
