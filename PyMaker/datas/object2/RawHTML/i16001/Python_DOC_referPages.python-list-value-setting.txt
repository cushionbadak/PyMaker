<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm creating a program where an input object is checked to see if it is present in a list.  If it is then it gets the position number and then uses that to determine the response from another list.
Is it possible to have variables in a list like so:</p>
<pre><code>list[1] = "Some text"
list[2] = "Some more text"
list[3] = "Even more text"
</code></pre>
<p>So that one very long list isn't needed (it also makes it easier to find term values)</p>
<p>If you are aware with arrays in Small Basic, you'll know what I mean.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>With a Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow">dict</a>, you can do something along these lines.</p>
<p>First, have all you lines of text in a multiline block:</p>
<pre><code>constants='''\
Some text
Some more text
Even more text'''
</code></pre>
<p>Then use a dict comprehension to create a mapping betweens the lines of text and a number:</p>
<pre><code>to_test={line:i for i, line in enumerate(constants.splitlines(), 1)}

&gt;&gt;&gt; to_test
{'Some more text': 2, 'Some text': 1, 'Even more text': 3}
</code></pre>
<p>Then you test membership of some test:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Some text' in to_test
True
</code></pre>
<p>And find the associated integer with the text:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; to_test['Some text']
1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In addition to dawg's answer, if you really want a python list, you should do it as such:</p>
<pre><code>l = ["Some text", "Some more text", "Even more text"]
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you can use it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "Some text" in l
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; l.index("Some text")
0
</code></pre>
<p>You could also build <code>l</code> this way, but it is less "pythonic":</p>
<pre><code>l = []
l.insert(0, "Some text")
l.insert(1, "Some more text")
l.insert(2, "Some more text")
</code></pre>
<p>Also remember that python indexing is <code>0</code> based!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@SLawson I think you are right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems I was hunting for the dict object</span>
