<p>Basically i wrote this code ..</p>
<pre><code>import sympy
number = 5.62527e-11;
f = sympy.Symbol('f');
answer = sympy.solve(Eq(f,number),f);
print(answer);
</code></pre>
<p>and as expected the answer is "5.62527e-11"</p>
<p>but when i change "5.62527e-11" to "5.62527e-67" and run the same code ...i am getting 
[0.0] as output which is awkward ...it is working for "e-11" but fails for "e-67" can someone please exp-lain why this is happening ..and can someone show me the solution ...i need a solution for this problem</p>
<p>Note : the above code is just a piece of the actual code ...and i have to run it in the same way ...so can anyone please help me dealing with that number ?</p>
<p>thanks in advance</p>

<p>The limitation of floating point numbers is that they are only accurate to a certain about of decimal places. I was curious about your question myself and found <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html</a></p>

<p>Use a symbol instead of the number (and substitute it in at the end if necessary):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympy import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; number = Symbol('5.62527e-11')
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = sympy.Symbol('f');
&gt;&gt;&gt; sympy.solve(Eq(f,number),f)
[5.62527e-11]
