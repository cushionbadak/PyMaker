<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to interface with some existing code that saves a configuration, and expects a file path that is of type 'path.path'.  The code is expecting that the file path is returned from a pygtk browser window (via another function).  I want to call the save_config function elsewhere in my code with a file path based on different inputs, constructed from string elements.</p>
<p>When I try to run the code, I am able to construct the file path correctly, but it is a string type, and the save function expects a 'path.path' type.</p>
<p>Is there a way to convert a string to a path type?  I've tried searching, but could only find the reverse case (path to string).  I also tried using <code>os.path.join()</code>, but that returns a string as well.</p>
<p>edit: This is python 2.7, if that makes a difference.</p>

<p>Maybe that answer worked for python 2.7, if you are on Python 3 I like:</p>
<pre><code>import os

p = "my/path/to/file.py"
os.path.normpath(p)
'my\\path\\to\\file.py'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If <code>path.path</code> represents a type, you can probably create an instance of that type with something like:</p>
<pre><code>string_path = "/path/to/some/file"
the_path = path.path(string_path)
save_config(the_path()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since python 3.4:</p>
<pre><code>from pathlib import Path
str_path = "my_path"
path = Path(str_path)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>path.path</code>? Sounds like a class that is defined by the code you are using; it's not a standard type or class. Prior to Python 3.4, there was no standard for paths; functions operating on paths just used the string representation. Python 3.4 introduced the <code>pathlib</code> module, which provides proper objects to represent paths.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I run <code>type(file_path)</code>, I get <code>&lt;class 'path.path'&gt;</code> as a response.  There is a <code>from path import path</code> line at the top of my file.  I'm assuming this is just <code>os.path</code>, but I'm new to this, and the guy who wrote this tool left the company.</span>
