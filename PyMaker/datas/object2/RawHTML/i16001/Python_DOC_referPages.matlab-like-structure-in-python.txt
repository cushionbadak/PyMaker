<p>I'm new to Python. I would like to use MATLAB-like structure in python. I already see several solutions in stackoverflow using dictionary, such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23611197/matlab-structure-in-python">this</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14922586/matlab-struct-array-to-python">this</a>. However, I feel like the dummy object approach in the code below is more MATLAB-like and more natural to use since we don't need the double quotes for names of attributes. The use case for me is sololy to wrap several objects together in a casual way, such that some of the functions don't need to have a long list of arguments. For example, the last function below only has two arguments rather than 6. </p>
<p>My question is: now I have to define the dummy class Structure in my script. Is it necessary? If many of my scripts need to use it, I will have to put it somewhere that all my functions can access. Is there a built-in "dummy class" already existed I can just use?</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

class Structure:
  pass

def construct_network():
  net = Structure()
  net.n = 100;
  net.Weights = np.random.rand(net.n, net.n)
  net.biases = np.random.rand(net.n, 1)
  return net

def a_function_operate_on_two_nets(net1, net2):
  # Use the net1 and net2 here.
</code></pre>

<p>python3.3 added <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.SimpleNamespace" rel="nofollow"><code>types.SimpleNamespace</code></a> which is what you're looking for.  For earlier versions of python, you may have to rely on something built for a similar (close enough) task -- e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.Namespace" rel="nofollow"><code>argparse.Namespace</code></a>.</p>
<p>And, of course there is always <code>collections.namedtuple</code> if you actually want something <em>structured</em> (which is usually preferred to something unstructured).</p>

<p>You created this structure in a file. For example put that code in struct.py
then in another python script just write <code>from struct.py import Structure</code>
or if you created other structures you can import all that clases using <code>from struct.py import *</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Look into <code>namedtuple</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Interesting. You answered both my current question and some questions I will likely ask in the future :)</span>
