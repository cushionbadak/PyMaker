<p>I am not able to kill process bound to 8000 port, due to which I am not able to start HTTP server. This is in reference to question
 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25955988/start-http-https-server-python-m-simplehttpserver/25956220#25956220">Start HTTP/HTTPS server, python -m SimpleHTTPServer</a></p>
<pre><code>C:\&gt;taskkill /f /pid 4
ERROR: The process with PID 4 could not be terminated.
Reason: Access is denied.

<p>Even killing by below is not working which I found somewhere. </p>
<pre><code>C:\&gt;taskkill /f /s localhost /pid 4
ERROR: The process with PID 4 could not be terminated.
Reason: Access Denied.

<p>PID 4 is system process, what might be running on there, how do I stop it, why are other ports is a similar fashion listening. </p>
<pre><code>C:\&gt;netstat -ab

<p>As per python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> the <code>http.server</code> module can also be invoked directly using the <code>-m</code> switch of the interpreter with a port number argument. Similar to the previous example, this serves the files relative to the current directory.</p>
<pre><code>python -m http.server 8000
</code></pre>
<p>In case your port 8000 is already is being used just change it to another no. </p>
<pre><code>python -m http.server 5000
</code></pre>
<p>It's not a good idea to arbitrarily just kill processes and more over system processes.  </p>

<p>if you're in Windows this might help you, the port 80 is usually being used by this service: "World Wide Web Publishing Service", open "Services" in the Control Panel and stop it</p>

<p>Don't do this - there is a reason why you are not able to kill it, because you didn't start it. Instead pass another port number:</p>
<p>For Python 3:</p>
<pre><code>python -m http.server 8080
</code></pre>
<p>For Python 2:</p>
<pre><code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, logined as administrator only</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes able to start on another port, but still curious what might be running on that port and it that case also I should be able to kill that.</span>
