<p>I am trying to install scipy in cygwin (Win8-64) using easy_install and I have such kind of error:</p>

<p>I can't figure it out by my owin what is wrong. Help will be appresiated here.</p>
<p>I also wonder if the successful installation of scipy will result in installation libraries for python2.7 or for python3 both of which I have in me PC (I need both)?</p>
<p>Any help? 
Thanks in advance!</p>
<hr/>
<p>After help of @abarnert:</p>
<p><strong>What I have done so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>install all FORTRAN libraries via setup.exe (libgfortranlib, gcc-fortran, etc)</li>
<li>pip2.7 install scipy</li>
<li>pip3.2 install scipy</li>
</ul>
<p>No problems were met during this type of installations.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The error at the end seems pretty clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>error: Blas (<a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/" rel="nofollow">http://www.netlib.org/blas/</a>) libraries not found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it even tells you how to solve the error. What do you want someone here to tell you beyond that?</p>
<p>There may be a BLAS library as part of Cygwin's setup app. If not, go to the URL linked in the error message and download BLAS yourself.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Meanwhile, even though this is a completely separate question, I'll answer it:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It depends on which <code>easy_install</code> you're running. The simplest thing to do is not try to guess or figure it out, just explicitly use <code>easy_install-2.7</code> and <code>easy_install-3.4</code> (or whichever version).</p>
<p>However, you probably shouldn't be using <code>easy_install</code> in the first place. Use <code>pip</code> instead unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, as recommended by both the <a href="https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/current.html" rel="nofollow">Python Packaging User Guide</a> and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html" rel="nofollow">official Python docs</a>.</p>
