<p>Ive to run awk from the python. When I run the script from the terminal, gives the desired output but showing error when 
executing from inside the python.</p>
<pre><code>runAwk = '''awk '{printf $1}{for(i=2;i&lt;=NF;i++)printf "|"$i}{printf "\n"}' final.txt'''

os.system(runAwk)
</code></pre>
<p>gives the error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>awk: line 1: runaway string constant " ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when I surfed from the web, I found that awk can not be used with os module and there are not much contents. I am confused how to proceed ahead.</p>

<p>The <code>\n</code> in your <code>runAwk</code> string is being interpreted by Python as a literal newline character, rather than being passed through to <code>awk</code> as the two characters <code>\</code> and <code>n</code>. If you use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#index-16" rel="nofollow">raw string</a> instead, by preceding the opening triple-quotes with an <code>r</code>:</p>
<pre><code>runAwk = r'''awk '{printf $1}{for(i=2;i&lt;=NF;i++)printf "|"$i}{printf "\n"}' final.txt'''
</code></pre>
<p>... then Python won't treat <code>\n</code> as meaning "newline", and <code>awk</code> will see the string you intended.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@simonzack although the error was caused by <code>\n</code> being treated specially by Python, that's some way from being a duplicate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@simonzack: how could you say that my post is duplicate? If I've known that the error was caused due to absence of "r" string, I didn't have post this question. How could you've searched for the solution if you were a newbie and faced the same problem.  Please correct your bogus statement.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ZeroPiraeus Judging by your rep, you probably have seen this question be posted dozens of times on stackoverflow. Do you really want every question like this be answered by 10 competing answers instead of being marked as duplicate?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@nancyli I wanted to point you in the right direction, and you meet me with aggression. Fix your attitude problem and read a programming book.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for the prompt answer. Can you please elaborate this "raw string" concept you mention here. How does this help in executing the awk script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@nancyli: see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/2081640">What exactly do "u" and "r" string flags do in Python, and what are raw string literals?</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@nancyli the link provided by Martijn is worth reading, as is the link in my answer. I've also expanded my answer a little.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ZeroPiraeus,@Martjin Pieters thank you everyone for the help.</span>
