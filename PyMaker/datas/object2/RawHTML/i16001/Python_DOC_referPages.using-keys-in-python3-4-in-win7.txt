<p>I'm reading <em>Natural Language Processing with Python</em> by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, Edward Loper.
And in this book, they use python2.4 or 2.5, but I could get python3.4.1 and python3.3 and python2.7.1. So I can1t use keys().</p>
<p>Please tell me how to use python2.4 or 2.5, or how to make "keys()" on myself.
I know the concept of function so I will make keys() with some hints, please help me!</p>

<p>If you are trying to use a book designed for Python 2.4 or 2.5, you can use Python 2.7 and not have any problems.</p>
<p>Python 3 <code>dict.keys()</code> exists and works just fine. It returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dictionary-view-objects" rel="nofollow">dictionary view object</a> rather than a list like in Python 2, so all you have to do to get the same result is call <code>list(somedict.keys())</code>.</p>
<p>However, you'll have other problems translating the Python 2 code to Python 3, and I strongly advice you to stick with a Python 2.x interpreter.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Python 3 has <code>dict.keys()</code>. What makes you think it doesn't?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And you can use Python 2.7, instead of 2.4 or 2.5. Just about everything that works in 2.4 and 2.5 will work just fine in 2.7.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much for your answer and advice!I'm going to master Natural Language Processing, not python3.4.1.So I　will recieve your advice to use python2.7.Some other functions has another work from the book, if I can do as on the book, it's very happy.Very nice advice,　Regard</span>
<span class="comment-copy">dict.keys() had worked!Thank you! But .keys() had worked too! What a amaging! I am noob!</span>
