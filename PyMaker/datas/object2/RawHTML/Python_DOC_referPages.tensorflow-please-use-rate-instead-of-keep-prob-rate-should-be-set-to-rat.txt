<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I get this warning most of the time when i define a model using Keras. It seems to somehow come from tensorflow though:</p>
<pre><code>WARNING:tensorflow:From C:\Users\lenik\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\lib\site-packages\keras\backend\tensorflow_backend.py:3445: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
</code></pre>
<p>Is this warning something to worry about?
If yes, how do i solve this problem?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Tensorflow is telling you that the argument <code>keep_prob</code> is deprecated and that it has been replaced by the argument <code>rate</code>. </p>
<p>Now, to achieve the same behavior you have now and remove the warning, you need to replace every occurrence of the <code>keep_prob</code> argument with <code>rate</code> argument, and pass the value <code>1-keep_prob</code>.</p>
