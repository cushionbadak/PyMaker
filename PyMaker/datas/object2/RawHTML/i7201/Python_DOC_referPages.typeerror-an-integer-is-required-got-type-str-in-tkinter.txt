<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I'm programming an app, which lets you store the info you provide to a listbox, which can be also used to print the data somewhere. (Create a txt with it stored.) I also tried all the advice from previous users posts, but couldn't find my case. Any help appreciated.</p>
<p>For some reason im getting the error you see in the title.</p>
<p>Here's my code:</p>

    itemList.delete(dataSelect)

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're getting that error because your Print function tries to open a file in this format. The open function in os accepts filename, mode, buffer in that order.  This is what you have in your script:</p>
<pre><code>f = open('items.txt', dataDirectory, 'ab+')
</code></pre>
<p>You are passing (file name, path, mode).  Instead, you should do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>f = open(dataDirectory+'/items.txt', mode='a')
</code></pre>
<p>BTW, you will still have errors with how you are writing.  I'd suggest you read the documentation for os items and their use in Python 3.  Go to your terminal and run this:  </p>
<pre><code>import os
help(os)
</code></pre>
<p>Also, read this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">article</a>, it will help you with migrating code from python 2 to 3 and will help you spot potential issues with migrations.  THe paragraph particularly interesting in your case is this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of this dichotomy you also need to be careful about opening
  files. Unless you have been working on Windows, there is a chance you
  have not always bothered to add the b mode when opening a binary file
  (e.g., rb for binary reading). Under Python 3, binary files and text
  files are clearly distinct and mutually incompatible; see the io
  module for details. Therefore, you must make a decision of whether a
  file will be used for binary access (allowing binary data to be read
  and/or written) or textual access (allowing text data to be read
  and/or written). You should also use io.open() for opening files
  instead of the built-in open() function as the io module is consistent
  from Python 2 to 3 while the built-in open() function is not (in
  Python 3 it’s actually io.open()). Do not bother with the outdated
  practice of using codecs.open() as that’s only necessary for keeping
  compatibility with Python 2.5.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">give us the full error please. Also please include enough code so that we can reproduce your error, this gives a different error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">TypeError: an integer is required (got type str)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean like the full Traceback, everything that's output. And please provide code so that it can be reproduced</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Before it said it's mostly code xD</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Yoshix that's what we want to see...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Required argument 'flags' not found. I tried making a seperate function for these two, even creating an existing file, but none works. Just gives a non ending sequence of errors.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Correct. As mentioned you are going to have to refactor that whole print function. It looks like you are trying to use the old 2.7 way of opening and writing to a file.  Read the migration article I provided and figure out what needs to be updated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Seems like I can't find my problem there. :( Btw, I never used Python2, just sometimes come up with my own Python3 functions haha.</span>
