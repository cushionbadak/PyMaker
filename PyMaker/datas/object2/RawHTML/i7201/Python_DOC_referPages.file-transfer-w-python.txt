<p>I am trying to make a program that will:
Copy &amp; Paste a Directory and place it, and it's contents into a new location. I do not think my code is right for this, I think it is simple just moving the file to a totally different location</p>
<pre><code>import os
import shutil
login = os.getlogin()

SOURCE_FILE_DEKSTOP =  '/Users/%s/Desktop' % (login)
DST_FILE_WD = 'Users/%s/WorkDocs' % (login)

shutil.move(SOURCE_FILE_DEKSTOP, DST_FILE_WD)
</code></pre>
<p>I am getting this error as well</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "/Users/gomcrai/pythings/fileTransfer.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;

<p>If you genuinely want to copy, rather than move, then <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copytree" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="shutil.copytree">shutil.copytree</a> is a better bet. <code>move</code> will, well, move the entry, deleting the original.</p>
<p>You're getting an error because Macs have access control lists on the folders that it thinks should always be there, and <code>Desktop</code> is one of those, since it's used to store all the files visible on your desktop. Since <code>shutil.move</code> is trying to delete that, it's meeting the ACL and being denied.</p>
<p><code>ls -ale /Users/gomcrai/Desktop</code> should show you the ACL, displaying something like: <code>0: group:everyone deny delete</code></p>
<p>If you'd like to <em>cut</em> and paste rather than <em>copy</em> and paste the directory, you could either use <code>os.listdir</code> or <code>os.walk</code> and find files and folders inside <code>Desktop/</code> and move all of those, or use <code>shutil.copytree</code> on <code>Desktop</code> and then remove everything inside <code>Desktop</code> while leaving that folder alone.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So...do you have permission to move that file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am a Domain Admin, and the account im doing this on is set to local admin, so I should have the ability to do this. OS = Mac, incase anyone needed to know</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I definitely want to copy being we have infosec policies here where we have to retain the info on the orginal device for 2 weeks minimum.  Thank you very much !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I also want it to overwrite the Destination Folder if there is one already in there I re adjusted my code to create a folder inside my destination but if it already exists I want it to just overwrite it @Simon Fraser</span>
