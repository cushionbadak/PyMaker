<p>I am trying to construct a python lambda function from either a single parameter or a list, and am unsure what syntax to use to build the lambda:</p>
<pre><code>def check_classes_filter(*class):
    return lambda x: isinstance(x, class) and isinstance(x, class[1]...)
</code></pre>
<p>The lambda should check if x is an instance of any number of classes that is passed to the function (either one or many).</p>
<p>Is there a general way to build functions from an arbitrary number of parameters in python, maybe as a kind of comprehension? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could loop over your <code>classes</code> args using <code>all</code>.</p>
<pre><code>def check_classes_filter(*classes):
    return lambda x: all(isinstance(x, c) for c in classes)

&gt;&gt;&gt; fun = check_classes_filter(str)
&gt;&gt;&gt; fun('hello')
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; fun = check_classes_filter(int, str)
&gt;&gt;&gt; fun('hello')
False
</code></pre>
<p>Although I'd prefer just passing in a <code>list</code> of classes</p>
<pre><code>def check_classes_filter(classes):
    return lambda x: all(isinstance(x, c) for c in classes)
</code></pre>
<p>and calling the function as</p>
<pre><code>check_classes_filter([int, str])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to check that an object is an instance of any listed class, you don't need to define anything:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance('test', int)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance('test', str)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance('test', (int, str))
True
</code></pre>
<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>isinstance</code> documentation</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other such
  tuples), return true if object is an instance of any of the types.</p>

<p>In your question, you mention <code>if x is an instance of any number of classes that is passed to the function (either one or many)</code>, it would mean that you should <code>or</code> instead of <code>and</code> in your boolean logic. If you want to check that an object is an instance of every listed classes, see the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45487502/6419007">answer with <code>all</code></a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you want to make a lambda function for this as opposed to an actual function that can handle an arbitrarily long list of objects?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, it's really part of a bigger function that needs to pass a lambda function as a parameter into another function, and I didn't want to change the source code of the function that accepts the lambda.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I wanted to use <code>and</code> instead of <code>or</code>, otherwise I would have just used the built in functionality. Thanks for your response though, I should have made it more clear.</span>
