<p>I am trying to create a Python command-line app, which supports both interactive (currently using Cmd) and inline modes (like Python's <code>python -c</code>). Is there a good way to do it without duplicating the 'line parsing' code?</p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#cmd.Cmd.onecmd" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Cmd.onecmd</code></a> method:</p>

<p>Interpret the argument as though it had been typed in response to the prompt.</p>
