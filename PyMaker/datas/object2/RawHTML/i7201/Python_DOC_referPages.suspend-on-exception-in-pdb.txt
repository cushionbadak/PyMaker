<p>Is there a way to set a dynamic breakpoint***, suspend on exception, in pdb?</p>
<p>***dynamic in the sense of not tied to any line number</p>
<p>In pycharm (pydev), this is possible and is a nice feature, but often times, I have to use pdb due to limitations of the pycharm debugger (no jump functionality and/or the machine doesn't have pycharm).</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're looking for <code>postmortem</code> mode:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    code_that_may_raise_exception()
except Exception:
    import pdb; pdb.post_mortem()
</code></pre>
<p>This will break on exception and drop you into a debugger right where it is being raised from</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#pdbcommand-break" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Er, yes, but they don't include this feature.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"If a second argument is present, it is an expression which must evaluate to true before the breakpoint is honored."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes i have read the docs thoroughly. I'm not asking how to set a breakpoint or breakpoint expression. I'm asking how to, regardless of the line number, break if the line will throw an exception.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah but sadly the exception has already occurred and the code exits. What I'm looking for is to jump over the exception once it happens. REPL in the python shell can handle exceptions just fine without tossing the memory. This is the behavior I'm seeking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried this?  It drops me into a debugger right at the <code>raise</code> statement</span>
