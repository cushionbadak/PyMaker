<p>I want to be able to make calls to both <a href="https://github.com/bitsoex/bitso-py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this Python 2 API</a> and <a href="https://github.com/veox/python3-krakenex" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this Python 3 API</a> from the same code.</p>
<p>There is a Python 2 version of the latter API but its surface is too small. No Python 3 version of the former.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/cporting.html#cporting-howto" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this document</a> that seems to suggest the only way to make them compatible is by manually making several changes to the code, which, since I learned python a couple of days ago, is likely to lead to a host of errors and problems.</p>
<p>Other ideas to access both APIs together also welcome.</p>
<p>Much appreciated.</p>

<p>That bitso-py library is just a Python wrapper for a REST API. If the library is not compatible with Python 3, you can make the relevant REST calls directly using something like the <code>requests</code> library.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you're new to Python, i recommend you learning and using Python3. Python2 is a legacy and its support will end soon. There will be only Python3 in the next years. Howver you can port your python2 code to python3 (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just skimmed the contents of the first one, but it doesn't look all that difficult to port to python3, other then replacing <code>print</code> statements and the "shebang" of the files, I didn't see anything particular different in syntax. If you do have errors after the switch, research it, or open a new question about it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. I'm probably worrying unnecessarily before the fact. I'll just try porting the old module(s).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. I'm new to coding. The other API's website says "The Kraken team has provided a basic PHP library for interfacing with the Kraken REST API." and "Use this library class to make calls to the Kraken REST API with a PHP client." (<a href="https://www.kraken.com/help/api" rel="nofollow noreferrer">kraken.com/help/api</a>) Does that mean I can just use the requests library you mention to make calls to both from Python? Why is there talk of PHP? Does it mean I need to use PHP directly instead of Python? Apologies for the generalized confusion.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well I was looking at the Bitso one, which is <a href="https://bitso.com/api_info/#error-codes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fully documented</a>. Ignore any talk of PHP, you just make the calls directly to their HTTP endpoints. <code>requests</code> is an easy-to-use HTTP library.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I'll try what you're saying and or porting the code to make it compatible as suggested above. Is there a way for me to put this question on hold or deleting it in a way such that I can re-instate it later without writing a new question if needed?</span>
