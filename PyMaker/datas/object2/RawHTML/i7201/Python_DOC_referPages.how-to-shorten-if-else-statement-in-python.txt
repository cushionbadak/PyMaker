<p>I'd like to shorten my <code>if, elif, else</code> statement, Here's what it looks :</p>
<pre><code>transparency == False
if transparency == 'true':
    transparency = True
elif transparency == 'false':
    transparency = False
else:
    transparency = True
</code></pre>
<p>And here's what I tried :</p>
<pre><code>transparency == False
transparency == 'true' ? True: False #boolean type
</code></pre>
<p>I thought it'd work like the javascript shorthand, am I wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are overcomplicating things. The value is <code>False</code> only if originally equal to <code>'false'</code>, <code>True</code> for <em>anything else</em>:</p>
<pre><code>transparency = transparency != 'false'
</code></pre>
<p>You otherwise got your Javascript syntax mixed up with Python; the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="noreferrer">Python conditional expression syntax</a> is spelled</p>
<pre><code>&lt;true_expr&gt; if &lt;test&gt; else &lt;false_expr&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Basically, if <code>transparency</code> is anything other than <code>'false'</code>, it's going to be <code>True</code>. Soâ€¦</p>
<pre><code>transparency = transparency != 'false'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I knew I was overcomplicating things that's why I was wondering how I could do it in one line :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"'id like to shorten my if, else if, else statement," You broke his concept by assuming his logic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is the logic OP's code expresses. The result is exactly the same.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RoyHolzem The answer is a one liner that works in all context, it does respect my logic.</span>
