<p>The python logging library allows to log based on different levels:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-levels" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-levels</a>
But I would like to use it to log based on custom tags,  for example "show_intermediate_results" or "display_waypoints_in_the_code" or "report_time_for_each_module" and so on...
Those tags cannot be measured in a severity ladder, during development i would sometimes want to see them and sometimes not depending on what i am developing/debugging at the moment.
So the question is if I can use the logging library to do that?
Btw, i DO want to use the library and not write something by myself because i want it to be thread safe.</p>

<p>As per <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#filter-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a>, you can use <code>logging.Filter</code> objects with <code>Logger</code> and <code>Handler</code> instances</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for more sophisticated filtering than is provided by levels.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure that will help me because I am more interested in controlling the <i>console</i> printing. A different logger may help to direct output to different log file.</span>
