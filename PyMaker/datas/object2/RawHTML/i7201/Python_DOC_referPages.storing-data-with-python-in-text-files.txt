<p>Similar questions have been asked but none quite like this.</p>
<p>I need to save 2 pieces of information in a text file, the username and their associated health integer. Now I need to be able to look into the file and see the user and then see what value is connected with it. Writing it the first time I plan to use open('text.txt', 'a') to append the new user and integers to the end of the txt file.</p>
<p>my main problem is this, How do I figure out which value is connected to a user string? If they're on the same line can I do something like read the only the number in that line?</p>
<p>What are your guys' suggestions? If none of this works, I guess I'll need to move over to json.</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3277503/how-do-i-read-a-file-line-by-line-into-a-list">This</a> may be what you're looking for.  I'd suggest reading one line at a time to parse through the text file.</p>
<p>Another method would be to read the entire txt and separate strings using something like  <code>text_data.split("\n")</code>, which should work if the data is separated by line (denoted by '\n').</p>

<p>You're probably looking for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">configparser</a> which is designed for just that!</p>
<p><strong>Construct a new configuration</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import configparser
&gt;&gt;&gt; config = configparser.ConfigParser()
&gt;&gt;&gt; config.sections()
[]
&gt;&gt;&gt; config['Players'] = {
...     "ti7": 999,
...     "example": 50
... }
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('example.cfg', 'w') as fh:
...     config.write(fh)  # write directly to file handler
...
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Now read it back</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import configparser
&gt;&gt;&gt; config = configparser.ConfigParser()
&gt;&gt;&gt; config.read("example.cfg")
['example.cfg']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(dict(config["Players"]))
{'ti7': '999', 'example': '50'}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Inspecting the written file</strong></p>
<pre><code>% cat example.cfg
[Players]
ti7 = 999
example = 50
</code></pre>

<p>If you already have a text config written in the form <code>key value</code> in each line, you can probably parse your config file as follows:</p>
<pre><code>user_healths = {}                              # start empty dictionary
with open("text.txt", 'r') as fh:              # open file for reading
    for line in fh.read().strip().split('\n'): # list lines, ignore last empty
        user, health = line.split(maxsplit=1)  # "a b c" -&gt; ["a", "b c"]
        user_healths[user] = int(health)       # ValueError if not number
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this will make the user's health the last value listed in <code>text.txt</code> if it appears multiple times, which may be what you want if you always append to the file</p>
<pre><code>% cat text.txt
user1 100
user2 150
user1 200
</code></pre>
<p>Parsing <code>text.txt</code> above:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(user_healths)
{'user1': 200, 'user2': 150}
</code></pre>
</div>
