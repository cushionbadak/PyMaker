<p>I just want to ask that like taking random number from: <code>Random.randint(a, b)</code></p>
<p>I just want to ask that how to take random string just like <code>randint</code> but this time with random string. Is there anyway?</p>

<p>This is a little game which request from you to enter 6 names and then the game will guess a number between those 6 numbers you have entered but it always gaves me an error.  want to do it with random string. </p>

<p><strong>Hello M. Husnain,</strong></p>
<h1>Chr() Function</h1>
<p><strong>chr(i)</strong><br/>
Return the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer i. For example, chr(97) returns the string 'a', while chr(8364) returns the string 'â‚¬'. This is the inverse of ord().  </p>
<p>The valid range for the argument is from 0 through 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF in base 16). ValueError will be raised if i is outside that range.</p>

<p>Try this below code,</p>

<p>I hope my answer is helpful.<br/>
If any query so comment please.</p>

<p>You can do it using random.randint :</p>
<pre><code>my_string = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
index = random.randint(0,25)
letter = my_string[index]
</code></pre>
<p>You  just have to loop over that to build strings from letters</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try this,</p>
<pre><code>import string
alpha = string.ascii_uppercase
num = string.digits
''.join(random.choice(alpha + num) for _ in range(5)) #number you want
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of saving the names into different variables I'd propose a list containing the names entered. It could look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>name_list = []
print('Please enter the first name in letters')
name_list.append(input())
print('Please enter the second name in letters')
name_list.append(input())
...
</code></pre>
<p>You can then randomly select a list item using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random.choice</a> e.g.</p>
<pre><code>import random
secretname = random.choice(name_list)

<h1>Update:</h1>
<p>For the specific case you described, you can simply create a list of characters containing all of the characters you allow. then you can use this, to create a word of length <code>X</code> (replace with actual length:</p>
<pre><code>base_chars = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', '1', '2', '3' ]
word_length = 10 #change this to the desired word length
[random.choice(base_chars) for _ in range(word_length)]
</code></pre>
<h1>Original:</h1>
<h3>Random string - define your characters</h3>
<p>You should first decide what kind of characters you want to use.
For example, if you want to use ASCII chars from 0 to 127 or maybe just a-z and A-Z. Also consider digits, space etc. So you should first decide the set of characters you want to select randomly from.</p>
<h3>Selecting a character randomly</h3>
<p>If you would like to use 0 to 127 range in the ASCII table, you can use this:</p>
<p><code>char = chr(random.randint(0, 127))</code></p>
<h3>Generating a random word</h3>
<p>Now, to create a word, you should first decide the size of it. This can also be randomize. For example, we will randomly choose a size of a word (with limited range):</p>
<pre><code>rand_str = ""
for _ in range(10):
     rand_str += chr(random.randint(0, 127))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">There are many problems in your code... no need to use <code>str</code> around <code>input()</code>, your name variables are being deleted right after the input by doing <code>name1=a</code> etc... you are not using <code>random.randint</code> right at all.... I suggest you attempt smaller pieces to see if they even work before joining them all to a program. If you have specific questions free free to open more detailed question about the actual errors, but with <i>minimal</i> examples</span>
