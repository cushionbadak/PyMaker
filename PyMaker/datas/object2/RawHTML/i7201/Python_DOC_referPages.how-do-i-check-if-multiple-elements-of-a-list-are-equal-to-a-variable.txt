<p>I am trying to make a shuffled playing card deck and in order to do so I have to check if the generated card is equal to the previous ones. So far I have tried this:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(51):
a=card()
while(deck[:i]==a):
    a=card()
deck[i]=a
</code></pre>
<p>card is the function that generates a random card
I think that the problem is in the [:i]
P.S. The list already has 52 elements and they are all set as "Empty"</p>

<p>To answer your question, you can do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(51):
    a = card()
    while a in deck:
        a = card()
    deck[i] = a
</code></pre>
<p>You can test for membership using <code>a in deck</code> because you said that deck is initialized to empty, so you don't have to check up to the i'th element, as the elements after i definitely won't contain a. </p>
<p>However, there is a better way to create a shuffled deck of cards: use <code>random.shuffle</code> as ctj232 said. </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.shuffle(l)
&gt;&gt;&gt; l
[3, 5, 4, 2, 1]
</code></pre>
<p>Make a list that represents all 52 cards in order, making your own class or just integers, then use the <code>random</code> library to shuffle them. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also do something like: </p>
<pre><code>    import random

    cards = [  i for i in range(52)]
    curentPosition = [  i for i in range(52)]
    nextPosition = [  i for i in range(52)]

    print('Positions before shufle:\n',curentPosition)

    for i in cards:
        randomPos = random.choice(nextPosition)
        curentPosition[i] = randomPos
        nextPosition.remove(randomPos)


    print('Positions after shufle\n',curentPosition)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using <code>random.shuffle</code> is absolutely the best way to solve your issue as the other answer has explained, but to answer your original question:</p>
<p>To check if multiple elements of a list are equal to a variable, you can use the <code>variable in list</code> syntax:</p>
<pre><code>my_list = [51,47,2,29,6]
if 51 in my_list:
    print("51 is already selected")
else:
    print("51 isn't in my_list")
</code></pre>
<p>To apply this to your existing code:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(51):
    a=card()
    while(a in deck):
        a=card()
    deck[i]=a
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not build a list of all cards, then call <code>random.shuffle</code> on the list representing the deck?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So I create the list using two while loops (one for numbers and one for suits) and then how do I use random.shuffle?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Once you have a list of everything, let's say you called it <code>deck</code>, just use <code>random.shuffle(deck)</code>. You can look at the docs for that too here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/random.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This solves the same problem OP is facing but doesn't answer his particular question. At the very least answer the question and offer the alternative afterwards.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Don You're right, I'll add that in too</span>
