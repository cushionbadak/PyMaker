<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>How can I remove duplicates lines without keeping one like that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>blabla<br/>
  potato<br/>
  blabla</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>potato</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> to count how often the lines appear, then filter for lines that appear only once.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lines="""blabla
... potato
... blabla""".splitlines()
&gt;&gt;&gt; counts = collections.Counter(lines)
&gt;&gt;&gt; [line for line in lines if counts[line] == 1]
['potato']
</code></pre>
<p>This is faster than using <code>lines.count</code> for each line, although this should barely matter unless the number of lines is <em>very</em> high.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try this:</p>
<pre><code>lines = ["blabla", "potato", "blabla"]

final_lines = [i for i in lines if lines.count(i) == 1]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Which programming language do you want to achieve this in?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No matter but I prefer python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This means that your question is #1 - too broad and #2 - prone to opinion-based answers (whichever favorite language people have). Please see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">How to ask</a> from StackOverflow documentation. I will add a Python tag so you can get a decent answer.</span>
