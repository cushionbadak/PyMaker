<p>I have a list of strings in which there are a lot of repeated items. I would like to make a new list in which all items are present but there is only one occurrence of each item.</p>
<p>input:</p>
<pre><code>mylist = ["hg", "yt", "hg", "tr", "yt"]
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>newlist = ["hg", "yt", "tr"]
</code></pre>
<p>I actually have tried this code but did not return what I want:</p>
<pre><code>newlist = []
for i in range(len(mylist)):
    if mylist[i+1] == mylist[i]:
        newlist.append(mylist[i])
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can simply use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set</a>:</p>
<pre><code>newlist = set(mylist)
</code></pre>
<p>Or, to retrieve exactly a <code>list</code>, but is can be useless depending what you are doing with:</p>
<pre><code>nexlist = list(set(mylist))    
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">ls = list(set(mylist))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is only appropriate if ordering is not significant.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is not asked to keep it ordered. But I added more explanations if it is the wanted behavior.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">irder is not important</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tiger-222 eh? <code>set</code>s are not ordered in Python 3.6, not even as an implementation detail, your thinking of <code>dict</code>s</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow, it seems I mixed informations in my brain. Thank you for the update.</span>
