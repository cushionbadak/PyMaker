<p>I have Anaconda 3.7 installed on Windows. It works in Jupyter but not in Spyder.
This code:</p>
<pre><code>import holoviews as hv
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
output_notebook ()
flora = pd.read_csv ('iris.csv')
hv.extension('bokeh')
frequencies, edges = np.histogram(flora['petal width'], bins = 5)
print(frequencies, edges)
hv.Histogram(frequencies, edges, label = 'Histogram')
</code></pre>
<p>returns only values:</p>
<pre><code>[49  8 41 29 23] [0.1  0.58 1.06 1.54 2.02 2.5 ]
WARNING:root:Histogram: Histogram edges should be supplied as a tuple along with the values, passing the edges will be deprecated in holoviews 2.0.
</code></pre>
<p>Is it possible to see histogram in Spyder?</p>

<p>(<em>Spyder maintainer here</em>) Holoviews produces content to be rendered in a web browser and Spyder consoles are not able to display that content at the moment, sorry.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can use <code>matplotlib</code> to plot the histogram. Read <a href="https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bazingaa thank you for your answer. I know that <code>matplotlib</code> could draw it. I'm just trying to understand how to use PyViz in Spyder.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It might be helpful to rename this question to being about displaying any HoloViews output in Spyder, as I don't think it's specifically an issue with histograms.</span>
