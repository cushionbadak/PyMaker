<p>I would like to run a node package by a python script. Specifically, I am running Python 3 on AWS lambda and I need to execute a <code>newman</code> command (<code>newman</code> is the CLI version of the postman app).</p>
<p>I have this working locally because I have <code>newman</code> installed globally (so I can execute the script through a python <code>subprocess</code>.</p>
<p>What is the ideal way of packaging up the <code>newman</code> package and all of its dependencies?  </p>

<p>The answer to this question is fairly straightforward (albeit it can appear to be a bit odd because of the nature of combining python with js).</p>

<p>If a <em>node</em> package is absolutely necessary to your python lambda, take the time to set up a proper npm virtual env in a directory of your choice (for me, I created <code>executables/node</code>) first for the package manager to do the manual labor of gathering dependencies (use <code>npm init</code> for this). Be sure to do a thorough review of using a node lambda in addition to a python lambda before you do this.</p>
<p>Once the env is there, install the packages that you need (for my case <code>newman</code>) with <code>npm install</code>.</p>
<p>Within the directory that you chose to work in, you will see all of the dependencies and the desired node package thrown into the <code>node_modules</code> directory. From there, force the python code to call the package from within the directory. Voila... You have yourself a node package working within a Python AWS lambda context.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you need <code>newman</code> specifically, can't you use a Python HTTP client?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>newman</code> is a API testing framework. It has dump truck loads more features than the python HTTP client has.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean <i>"the"</i> client? There are many Python tools. And if you want to use a Node tool specifically, why not write a Node lambda? This seems like an XY problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is what the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python http client</a> is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd absolutely love to debate why this question earned a down vote. Its extremely practical and common that an application developed in one language would need to rely on an application written in another, different language.</span>
