<p>I'm not sure if this is already on here, if so I'm sorry.</p>
<p>I am trying to put the output of a variable, a string in this case into another variables "name" if its called that, but using <code>exec</code> is not ideal and I don't want to put it all into an exec function.</p>
<p>Is there any way to do what I am attempting to do in this code?</p>
<pre><code>world = world[(x,y)].type 
exec("if blocks." + world + ".hasUp == True:")
    tick(taX,taY)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>__dict__</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def foo():
...     pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "hello"
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.__dict__[a] = "world"
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo.hello
'world'
</code></pre>
<p><code>globals()</code> for a global variable (returns a dictionary of global variables):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; name = "may"
&gt;&gt;&gt; globals()[name] = "the force be with you"
&gt;&gt;&gt; may
'the force be with you'
</code></pre>
<p><code>locals()</code> for a local variable:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; name = "life"
&gt;&gt;&gt; locals()[name] = "was like a box of chocolates"
&gt;&gt;&gt; life
'was like a box of chocolates'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Very unclear, but if I understand what you are trying to do, don't use <code>exec</code> but <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>getattr</code></a>. (rule of thumb: <b>never</b> use <code>exec</code> or <code>eval</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A variable has no output. Can you please rephrase your question, and make it clear what are the variables and what you mean by putting the output of a variable int another variable's "name"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you please explain this in more detail?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is an <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem">X/Y Problem</a> â€“ you are trying to work around some unknown problem and now you ask if we can fix that bad workaround. Please add more of your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">in addition to what usr2564301 said, it looks you trying to create variable/property dynamically and it hints at bad design</span>
