<p>I am generating a number from the range of 1 to 10 but would like to exclude the number <code>2</code> from that range i have no idea how to go about doing this.</p>
<p>This is what i have so far.</p>
<p><strong>python file</strong></p>
<pre><code>move =  random.randint(1, 10)
</code></pre>
<p>So to round of: I want to generate numbers between <code>1 to 10</code> and exclude number <code>2</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.choice</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>move =  random.choice([1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can generate a random value from 1 to 9 instead and shift it by one if it is bigger or equal to 2.</p>
<pre><code>value =  random.randint(1, 9)

move = value if value &lt; 2 else value + 1
</code></pre>
<p>Mathematically, you want to select a random element in a set of 9 elements. All you need to do is to identify the element 3 with 2, 4 with 3 and so on. In probability, this is what we call a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random variable</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A random variable is defined as a function that maps the outcomes of
  unpredictable processes to numerical quantities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This strategy of using a mapping is especially useful when your set is big and generating it would be costly, but the mapping rule is fairly simple.</p>
<p><strong>Improvement</strong>:</p>
<p>It was pointed out by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53773669/5079316">U9-Forward</a> that in this case the mapping can be made slightly more efficient. It suffices to map 2 to 10.</p>
<pre><code>value =  random.randint(1, 9)

move = value if value != 2 else 10
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Or do another way of conditioning like Olivier's answer:</p>
<pre><code>value =  random.randint(1, 9)
move = 10 if move==2 else move
</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>move</code> will never be <code>2</code> again.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can exclude number 2 using "while"</p>
<pre><code>move =  random.randint(1, 10)

while move == 2:
    move = random.randint(1, 10)
</code></pre>
<p>This code will generate random number until it won't be "2"</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>An obvious and easy interpretable path would be to exclude the <code>2</code> by a <code>while-loop</code> and just drawing numbers, using the function you mentioned, until the <code>2</code> gets not picked. This is yet highly inefficient but a work-around you can reach with basic programming concepts.</p>
<p>The more direct way would be to define your list more precisely, meaning without the <code>2</code> and making use of the <code>random.choice</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>import random
print(random.choice([1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Olivier's answer is probably better for this <i>specific</i> question but won't scale well if the rules are complex (like all primes less than a hundred). In that case, <code>choice</code> is the better , well choice, I guess :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your distribution is not uniform if you do that. 3 is more likely to be generated than any other number. See my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OlivierMelanÃ§on Wow, that's true, vote for yours.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OlivierMelanÃ§on Now?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes it works, I did not think of doing it like this, well done</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OlivierMelanÃ§on Happy it works :-), :D, ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ, i voted for yours earlier already.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this works, there is always a small chance that it takes a very long time to generate your number.</span>
