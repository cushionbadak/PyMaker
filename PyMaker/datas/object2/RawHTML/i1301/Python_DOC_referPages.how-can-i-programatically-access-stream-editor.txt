<p>I'm looking for a tool/package (preferably in JavaScript or Python) that can access SED or perform the same functionality as SED tools. </p>
<p>In my case, I wanted to output specific text data from a file that is accessed via API calls. One solution was to use stream editor. However, I can't seem to find some way to programatically access  Does anyone know of such a tool? Or can point me in the right direction?</p>

<p>sed(1) uses a general concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Regular Expression</a>, which you should read about. Both <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python</a> have built-in support for regular expression matching and substitution.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Having Python, why would you want sed? What does sed do that python doesn't?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you say more about your use case?  Which layer do you want to do the replacement - before the API call returns?  Once the response is parsed?  I agree that usually you wouldn't call <code>sed</code> from <code>python</code> or <code>js</code> because the capabilities are usually easier to program in those languages directly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Let me add some more context. This is building onto this question I asked a few days ago. I wanted to grab a specific text from GitHub README.md file from their API. The top answer was using stream editor to accomplish this task. However, I want to know if there is some programmatic way to achieve the same means.  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53605718/get-specific-readme-md-data-from-github-api/53605890#53605890">Previous Question</a></span>
