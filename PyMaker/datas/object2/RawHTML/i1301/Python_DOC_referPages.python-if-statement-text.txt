<p>Hi there, I'm newbie in <code>beautifulsoup</code>, and I am trying to print either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> if P tag match or contains specific text.</p>
<p>I can print the content of the p tag, but just can't output the true or false successful. e.g. <a href="https://www.the-ivy.co.uk/menus/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TRUE P tag contain "British dishes"</a></p>
<p>Get me those error informations:</p>
<blockquote>

  single item. Did you call find_all() when you meant to call find()?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your example, you need to go through each <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag text with a loop, and make sure your searching for text in one case, which <em>can</em> be lowercase, since <code>British Dishes</code> and <code>British dishes</code> won't match. You are also not calling <code>.text</code> on the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements, which won't extract the text from the tag. </p>
<p><strong>Fixed code:</strong></p>
<pre><code>x = soup.find_all('p')
for y in x:
    lowercase = y.text.lower()
    if lowercase.find("british dishes") != -1:
        print("TRUE")
    else:
        print("FALSE")
</code></pre>
<p>Which now prints:</p>
<pre><code>FALSE
FALSE
TRUE   # --&gt; line has 'British dishes'
FALSE
FALSE
FALSE
FALSE
FALSE
FALSE
FALSE
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you can just use the <code>in</code> operator, instead of <code>str.find()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for x in soup.find_all('p'):
    lowercase = x.text.lower()
    if 'british dishes' in lowercase:
        print ("TRUE")
    else: 
        print ("FALSE") 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Printing <code>"TRUE"</code> and <code>"FALSE"</code> is unnecessary when <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> are available. You can just use <code>print(True)</code> and <code>print(False)</code> instead here. </p>
<p>You could also wrap the search in function, and simply print out the boolean result:</p>
<pre><code>def line_result(line, to_find):
    return to_find in line.lower()

for x in soup.find_all('p'):
    print(line_result(line=x.text, to_find='british dishes'))
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to return combine this all into one result, you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any()</code></a> here:</p>
<pre><code>print(any("british dishes" in x.text.lower() for x in soup.find_all("p")))
# True
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">No this is he error I get: "ResultSet object has no attribute '%s'. You're probably treating a list of items like a single item.

<span class="comment-copy">can you please post your code when you are requesting the url.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your problem is, that your <code>x</code> contains a sequence of results.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm not hungry right now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Roadrunner that worked, any way just to return a single TRUE or FALSE result?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bramji Do you mean searching for <code>British dishes</code> in all of the text combined? instead of on each line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah all I want is one results either TRUE or FALSE, currently getting what you pointed out. In this example I would like to only have one TRUE be printed, if the word i was searching for was 'duck' I would like to only have FALSE printed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bramji Did you try the final code snippet with <code>any()</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks so much, yeah that worked. Perfect</span>
