<p>I see that None in python has been already instantiated at the beginning without me doing anything. Can someone help me to understand why I cannot do this even if None is just a 'name' for an object. </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; None = 3
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
SyntaxError: cannot assign to None

<span class="comment-copy"><code>None</code> is a builtin and part of the language.  It is not a normal name, it doesn't get "set" or "assigned".  There is a single instance of this type, the (more or less) keyword <code>None</code> accesses it, that's it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not clear what you're trying to ask. Are you trying to ask why you can't have instances of your own classes created at startup? Are you trying to ask why you can't assign to <code>None</code>? Are you trying to ask how <code>None</code> is created? Something else?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112 The question is whether someone can help understand.  The answer is yes.  The proof is what OP is looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python 2.7 specifically <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2.7/Python/ast.c#L133-L149" rel="nofollow noreferrer">forbids it</a> (but does allow assignment to <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>). Python 3 considers it <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a keyword</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's a built-in â€” suggest you check the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> <i>before</i> asking such questions.</span>
