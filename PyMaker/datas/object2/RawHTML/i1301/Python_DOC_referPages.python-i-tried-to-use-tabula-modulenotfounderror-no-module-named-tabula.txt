<p>I tried to use the module "tabula" for python, but apparently I already fail at installing. I simply used the code</p>
<pre><code>import tabula
</code></pre>
<p>However, I get the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tabula'
</code></pre>
<p>Any ideas what's up with that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to install it priorly, lauching this command in a console:</p>
<pre><code>pip install tabula-py
</code></pre>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>For WIndows 10, check the "Get tabula-py working (Windows 10)" part of <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tabula-py/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this documentation</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How did you install it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot! I tried that, but I get the message  The following command must be run outside of the IPython shell:      $ pip install tabula-py   Right now, I'm using Spyder, maybe that's the problem??? Sorry, if it's a super naive question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which message do you get?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The following command must be run outside of the IPython shell:      $ pip install tabula-py  The Python package manager (pip) can only be used from outside of IPython. Please reissue the <code>pip</code> command in a separate terminal or command prompt.  See the Python documentation for more information on how to install packages:      <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/installing</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">In which terminal did you launch that? On which Operating System?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have Windows 10, and I just used the console in the Spyder IDE ..?</span>
