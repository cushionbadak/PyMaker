<p>I am trying to compare a dictionary value with a variable but for some reasons I can't output the part that I want from the dictionary.
The dictionary is an ouput from a html table. 
This is the code that I use to prase the html table into a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>with open('output.csv') as fd:
    rd = csv.DictReader(fd, skipinitialspace=True)
    for row in rd:
        lista = { k: row[k] for k in row if k in ['Name', 'Clan Days']}
</code></pre>
<p>This is the output:</p>
<pre><code>{'Name': 'SirFulgeruL2k19', 'Clan Days': '140'}
{'Name': 'Darius', 'Clan Days': '127'}
</code></pre>
<p>How to I compare for example the clan days from the first dictionary and if the value matches the value that I set in a variable should get the name as a string so I can later use it in another line.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming you first read the data into a list of dictionaries:</p>
<pre><code>data = [{ k: row[k] for k in row if k in ['Name', 'Clan Days']}
        for row in rd]
</code></pre>
<p>You may use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>next()</code></a> to search for the first dictionary in <code>data</code> matching the <code>Clan Days</code> value defaulting to <code>None</code> if no entries matched your search query:</p>
<pre><code>desired_clan_days = '140'
clan_name = next((entry["Name"] for entry in data 
                  if entry["Clan Days"] == desired_clan_days), None)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, <code>next()</code> would return you the first match, if you need all of the matches, just use a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>clan_names = [entry["Name"] for entry in data 
              if entry["Clan Days"] == desired_clan_days]
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Note that this kind of search requires you to, in the worst case (entry not found), loop through all the entries in <code>data</code>. If this kind of search is the primary use case of this data structure, consider re-designing it to better fit the problem - e.g. having clan_days value as a key with a list of clan names:</p>
<pre><code>data = { 
    "140": ["SirFulgeruL2k19"],
    "127": ["Darius"]
}
</code></pre>
<p>In that state, getting a match would be a constant operation and as easy as <code>data[desired_clan_days]</code>. <code>defaultdict(list)</code> is something that would help you to make that transformation.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Not really sure what exactly you want, but if it's just comparing a dictionary value to a variable and getting the Name part if they match, you would get something like this..</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dict = {'Name': 'SirFulgeruL2k19', 'Clan Days': '140'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; target = 140
&gt;&gt;&gt; if int(dict['Clan Days']) == target:
...    name = dict['Name']
...    
&gt;&gt;&gt; name
'SirFulgeruL2k19'
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: Read your post too quickly, considering it's all the rows from a HTML table this code is too simple. Use alecxe's answer :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried adding the code that you suggested but for some reasons I get for the <code>desired_clan_days = '140'</code> line a syntax error. <code>import csv with open('output.csv') as fd:     data = [{ k: row[k] for k in row if k in ['Name', 'Clan Days']}         for row in fd             desired_clan_days = '140'             clan_names = [entry["Name"] for entry in data              if entry["Clan Days"] == desired_clan_days]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SirFulgeruL I think you forgot the closing <code>]</code> after the <code>for row in fd </code></span>
