<p>I am making a bot for a game. So far I have built the basics I need for my game. Now I want to get it a little bit further and make a mechanism that will randomly move the mouse within a range on my screen and click that position. How I am thinking it, I will set the top left, top right, bottom right, bottom left cords and pointer will mouse within that range and when it gets to the position it will do a click and after some time it will move to another random position. Any suggestion how I should start?</p>

<p>You could use <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyUserInput/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pymouse</a> to get screen resolution and control your mouse, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>randint()</code></a> to choose random coordinates to click at</p>
<pre><code>from pymouse import PyMouse
import random
import time

m = PyMouse()
x_dim, y_dim = m.screen_size()

while True:
    m.click(random.randint(0, x_dim), random.randint(0, y_dim))
    time.sleep(2)
</code></pre>
