<p>I made a simple Yahtzee game in as few of lines as I could think. Currently, the user must press Enter (with any value) to continue. I would like to use a loop statement so that the dice continue to roll until Yahtzee (all rolled numbers are the same). I would also like a 10 second timer. What is the best way to add a loop statement to this code? P.S. This is not homework, I wanted to make this game for my Yahtzee nights. My daughter wakes easil...haha</p>
<pre><code>import random

while True:
    dice1 = random.randint(1,6)
    dice2 = random.randint(1,6)
    dice3 = random.randint(1,6)
    dice4 = random.randint(1,6)
    dice5 = random.randint(1,6)
    numbers = (dice1, dice2, dice3, dice4, dice5)
    sum1 = sum(numbers)
    if  sum1 == ("5" or "10" or "15" or "20" or "25"):
        print("Winner, winner, chicken dinner!", dice1, dice2, dice3, dice4, dice5)
    else:
        print("Your rolls are: ", dice1, dice2, dice3, dice4, dice5)
    input("Press return key to roll again.")
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT: This is my final product. Thank you for all the help guys!!</strong></p>
<pre><code>import random
import time
input("Press return key to roll.")
for x in range(0,10000):
    numbers = [random.randint(1,6) for _ in range(5)]
    if all(x == numbers[0] for x in numbers):
        print("Winner, winner, chicken dinner!", numbers)
        input("Press return key to play again.")

    else:
        print("Your rolls are: ", numbers)        
        print("Next roll in one second.")
        time.sleep(1)   
</code></pre>

<p>If you would like to check if all the dice numbers are the same it is as simple as.</p>
<pre><code>allDice = [dice1, dice2, dice3, dice4, dice5] #List of dice variables
if all(x == allDice[0] for x in allDice): # If all dice are the same
    print("Yahtzee")
    break # Break out of while loop
</code></pre>
<p>The most simple way of having a "timer" could be adding a <code>time.sleep()</code>. You have to <code>import time</code> otherwise it won't work.</p>
<p>So replace
<code>input("Press return key to roll again.")</code>
with
<code>time.sleep(10)</code></p>
<p>This means every 10 seconds the dice will roll until all dice are the same number, if they are then it prints Yahtzee and stops the loop.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Replace the <code>while True:...</code> with a <code>while boolean_variable: ...</code> and set the value of that <code>boolean_variable</code> to <code>True</code> before the <code>while</code> loop and to <code>False</code> when you achieved Yahtzee =&gt; in the <code>if</code> condition.</p>
<p>What do you mean by 10 second timer, however? A sleep time of ten seconds can be implemented by a <code>time.sleep(10)</code> at the end of the inner <code>while</code> loop.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT <code>boolean_variable</code> EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<pre><code>import time
...
not_yahtzee = True
while not_yathzee:
    ....
    if sum == 5 or sum == 10 or ... :
        ...
        not_yahtzee = False
    else:
        ...
        time.sleep(10)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>...</code> represent the code you already have. As commented on your question, the <code>if</code> condition should look more like this one. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3844801/check-if-all-elements-in-a-list-are-identical">There are other ways on how to check all the elements in a list are the same</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>sum1 == ("5" or ...)</code> condition is true only when <code>sum1</code> is <code>'5'</code>(string). What you need is <code>sum1 in (5, 10, ...)</code>. <code>sum1</code> is integer and you need to test with integer (<code>5</code> not same as <code>'5'</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have a loop (<code>while True:</code>). Add a line where you compare if all numbers are the same. If this is true <code>break</code> out of the loop. Replace <code>input</code> with a call to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time.sleep</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And of course it would be easier to drop those numbered variables <code>dice1</code>, <code>dice2</code> and so on. Just create a list: <code>numbers = [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(5)]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matthias Thank you! That shortend my code by a lot ha ha</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your solution works only for a value of <code>1</code>. A simple solution for every number would be <code>if len(set(values)) == 1:</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why <code>x==1</code>? Dice can have values from 1 to 6.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I put that in to test and forgot to change to list value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Change that to <code>all(x == allDice[0] for x in allDice[1:])</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just got to work and will test this when I get home. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm still new to this. How do I use the boolean_variable?</span>
