<p>I'm trying to translate this pseudocode and can't do it accurately. In particular, I can't seem to figure out what <code>real</code> here means. This is the pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>Function Real average(Real values[], Integer size)
    Declare Real total = 0.0
    Declare Integer counter = 0

    While counter &lt; size
        Set total = total + values[counter]
        Set counter = counter + 1
    End While

    Return total / size
End Function

Declare Real scores[6] = 90, 80, 70, 100, 60, 80
Display average(scores, 6)
</code></pre>
<p>And this is what I've come up with:</p>
<pre><code>def average(values[], int(size))
    total = 0.0
    counter = 0

    while counter &lt; size:
        total = total + values[counter]
        counter = counter + 1

    return total / size

scores[6] = 90, 80, 70, 100, 60, 80
print(average(scores, 6))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Some languages use the term "real" in place of "float" etc.  Therefore, in Python, with this bit of code you can leave it out. 
..but there are a few things wrong with your code other than that. For example you just want</p>
<pre><code>scores=[90,80, 70, 100, 60, 80]
</code></pre>
<p>then just give average "scores" and 6</p>
<p>Like this</p>
<pre><code>def average(values ,size):
    total = 0.0
    counter = 0

    while counter &lt; size:
        total = total + values[counter]
        counter = counter + 1

   return total / size

scores = [90, 80, 70, 100, 60, 80]
print(average(scores, 6))
</code></pre>
<p>Whilst clearly it is not necessary to do this in this way, I presume you are just learning Python...</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I assumed as much, but I suppose my syntax is still incorrect</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suggest you <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read the very excellent Python documentation</a>, as you make some very basic mistakes. Remember: Python is a dynamically typed language, where you don't declare variables with a certain type or arity.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't need an "algorithm" for this, it's just <code>sum(values)/len(values)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The use of <code>Real</code> may hark back to when <a href="http://wiki.freepascal.org/Real" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pascal</a> was the Learning to Program language of choice.</span>
