<p>How can I sort by name and age in PYTHON?
I have the following list in .txt file:</p>
<pre><code>John, 14
Mike, 18
Marco, 25
Michael, 33
</code></pre>
<p>I want to sort this by name and by age. I wrote this code but it doesn't work:</p>
<pre><code>file = open("people.txt", "r")
data = file.readlines()
i = 0
for line in data:
     name, age = line.split(',')
     list = [name, age]
     i += 1
     print("For sorting by name press (1);")
     print("For sorting by age press (2);")
     z = eval(input())
     if z == 1:
          list.sort(key=lambda x: x.name, reverse=True)
          print([item.name for item in list])
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you very much guys :)</p>

<p>Here's one approach:</p>
<pre><code>with open("so.txt", "r") as f:
    lines = [line.split(',') for line in f]

    print("For sorting by name press (1);")
    print("For sorting by age press (2);")

    z = int(input())
    if z == 1:
        lines.sort(key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)
        print([item[0] for item in lines])
</code></pre>
<p>Using:</p>
<ul>
<li>a context manager to handle automatic file closure (this is the <code>with</code>)</li>
<li>the <code>for line in f</code> iterator to loop over the file's lines one at a time</li>
<li>a list comprehension to split the lines into lists as needed</li>
<li><code>int</code> instead of <code>eval</code></li>
<li>changing all <code>line.name</code> references to <code>line[0]</code> -- you could make the lines proper classes (or <code>namedtuple</code>s if you wanted the <code>.name</code> access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though, in general, solutions for parsing csv files exist (e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code></a> -- there were a few more issues in your code than just that.</p>
