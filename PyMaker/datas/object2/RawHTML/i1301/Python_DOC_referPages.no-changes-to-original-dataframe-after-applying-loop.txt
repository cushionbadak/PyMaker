<p>I have a list of dataframes such that </p>
<pre><code>df_lst = [df1, df2]
</code></pre>
<p>I also created a function which removes the rows with '0' in the dataframe:</p>
<pre><code>def dropzeros(df):
    newdf = df[df['x']!=0.0]
    return newdf
</code></pre>
<p>I tried applying this through a loop and placed an assignment variable within the loop, but the original dataframe remained unchanged even after running the loop. </p>
<pre><code>for df in df_lst:
    df = dropzeros(df)
</code></pre>
<p>I also tried using list comprehensions to go about it</p>
<pre><code>df_lst = [dropzeros(df) for df in df_lst]
</code></pre>
<p>I know the function works since when i apply print(len(df)) before and after the command dropzeros(df) there was a drop in the len, however, may I know how might I go about this problem such that my original dataframe is altered after running the loop?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That's because the variable <code>df</code> in your <code>for</code> loop does not <em>reference</em> a value in your list. You are creating a variable <code>df</code> afresh each iteration of your loop.</p>
<p>You can assign via <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> and <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.pipe.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pipe</code></a> your function:</p>
<pre><code>for idx, df in enumerate(df_lst):
    df_lst[idx] = df.pipe(dropzeros)
</code></pre>
