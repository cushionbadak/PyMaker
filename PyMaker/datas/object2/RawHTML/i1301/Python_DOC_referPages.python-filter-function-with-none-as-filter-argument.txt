<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>Input  : list(filter(None,["abs"," ",123,"sdf",""]))

Output : ['abs', ' ', 123, 'sdf']
</code></pre>
<p>As of my understanding <strong>None</strong> means "<strong>no value</strong>" in python. but in the above case how the filter function is removing the empty string.</p>
<p>I am confused with <strong>None</strong> in python. Can any one explain what exactly <strong>None</strong> represents in the above command and how come it is matching with non-empty strings.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> makes application clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If function is <code>None</code>, the identity function is assumed, that is, all
  elements of iterable that are false are removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So <code>filter(None, it)</code> removes all Falsy values such as <code>[]</code>, <code>{}</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>False</code>, <code>set()</code>, <code>''</code>, <code>None</code>, etc.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you asking why <code>""</code> is filtered out but <code>" "</code> is not?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how is this an identify function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so, None represents a falsy value and a non empty  string represents true value</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bonthavijetha, Exactly</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Chris_Rands, Good spot, <i>that</i> bit isn't clear. It seems the docs have defined it <i>themselves</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">an identify function normally returns the arguments it is passed, <code>map()</code> works like that in Python 2, e.g. <code>map(None, [0, 1])</code> &gt; <code>[0, 1]</code>, but i don't understand what it means in this context</span>
