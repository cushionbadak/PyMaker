<p>I'm making a highscore list, and the order of it should determined by number of points, the second element of the lists in list. 
This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import List, Tuple

name1 = 'John'
name2 = 'Ron'
name3 = 'Jessie'
points1 = 2
points2 = 3
points3 = 1

highscore: List[Tuple[str, int]] = []
highscore.append((name1, points1))
highscore.append((name2, points2))
highscore.append((name3, points3))

print(highscore)

sorted_by_second = sorted(highscore, key=lambda X: X[1])

highscore_list= str(sorted_by_second)
</code></pre>
<p>export list to file</p>
<pre><code>with open('highscore.txt', 'w') as f:
for item in highscore_list:
    f.write("%s\n" % item)
</code></pre>
<p>Then it looks like this in the file:</p>
<pre><code> [
 (
 J
 e
 s
 s
 i
 e
 ,

 1
 )
 ,
</code></pre>
<p>But I want it to look like this in the file:</p>
<pre><code>  Jessie 1
  John   2
</code></pre>
<p>How do I achieve this?</p>

<p>Kudos on the (optional) typing declaration!</p>
<p>You started formatting it as a string a bit too early. Better to preserve the structure of your pairs a little longer:</p>
<pre><code>for pair in sorted_by_second:
    f.write(f'{pair}\n')
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you prefer, break them out for more flexible <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">formatting</a>:</p>
<pre><code>for name, points in sorted_by_second:
    f.write(f'{name} scored {points}.\n')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You're iterating over a string, hence over each character in that string. Just omit the string conversion and format the output in your loop properly</span>
<span class="comment-copy">look up f-strings. You are using typing on one hand and python 2.7 style string formatting on the other  had - that does not fit well together : <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings</a>   and   <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec</a></span>
