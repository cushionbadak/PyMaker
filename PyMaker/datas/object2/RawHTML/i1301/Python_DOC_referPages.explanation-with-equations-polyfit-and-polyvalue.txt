<p>Actually i am trying to learn some numpy library libraries but i cannot able to understand how these libraries are working from inside. 
Can somebody explain me polyfit and polyval with equations by putting the value without library
i already checked the numpy documentation</p>

<p>2)<a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.polyval.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PolyVal Scipy Documetation</a></p>
<p>I checked on S0 and other places also but everybody explaing this with libraries can somebody expain me these in simple maths?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>You could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>inspect</code></a> module to check the source code for these functions.</p>
<p>For example this will show you the source code for <code>np.polyfit</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import inspect
print(inspect.getsource(np.polyfit))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">both docs point at relevant refs where you could look up the math involved, polyfit is actually a wrapper around <code>np.linalg.lstsq</code> so you might want to look at that too.</span>
