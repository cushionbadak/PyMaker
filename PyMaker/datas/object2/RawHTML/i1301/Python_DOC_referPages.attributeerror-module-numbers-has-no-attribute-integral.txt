<p>Im working on a Mac.
Python 3.7.0 is installed. Installed Anaconda, Pandas and Numpy. </p>
<p>In the command line if I type in Python and inside the Python shell I can type in import Pandas and it looks like it worked.</p>
<p>But in Komodo Editor if I execute: </p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import pandas
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: module 'numbers' has no attribute 'Integral'
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Here is the full Code:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import pandas

def main():
    print('Hello, World.')

if __name__ == '__main__': main()
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the Traceback:</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/9872#issuecomment-337098073" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>github link</code></a> shared by <code>Dušan Maďar</code>, <strong>it is most likely that you have a file called '<code>numbers.py</code>' which might be interfering with the python <code>Lib</code>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Renaming that file should fix the issue.</strong></p>

<span class="comment-copy">please post your full code as well as full traceback you get, not just the last line</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@buran, I just edited it. I added the full code and Traceback.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sadly not. My file is called "testpanda.py" and not numbers.py.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is weird as hell. I have indeed a file called "numbers.py" inside the same folder where my "testpandas.py" is. numbers.py wasn't even open at all its just enough to be in the same folder and it will mess with it. wtf</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Barry, it may be other file named numbers.py that is located in the same folder as your testpanda.py, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path</a> to get better understanding of module search path order</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Buran, that's crazy. Yes that was the problem. It confused me because this file is named "testpanda.py". What a weird bug. Hope they fix that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Barry, that's not a bug. Check the link I added in my previous comment</span>
