<p>Is there a way to generate a whole number/integer? I am attempting to find a way to generate a random number that is either a 0 or 1 or 2.... and Nothing in between. If I use:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

for i in range(5):
    action = np.random.uniform(0,2,1)#take random action between 0 1 or 2
    print(action)
</code></pre>
<p>Returns:</p>
<pre><code>[0.18429578]
[1.19763353]
[1.93240698]
[1.44706511]
[0.31182739]
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.randint.html#numpy.random.randint" rel="nofollow noreferrer">numpy.random.randint</a> seems like it would work but it will return an array. Would some sort of function be the best method to make this work? Thanks</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would recommend you use the random module and use random.randint which generates a random integer</p>
<pre><code>import random 

number = random.randint(0,2)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you need to use numpy?  There are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#functions-for-integers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a few methods in <code>random</code></a> that would do what you're looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not get a one-element array and select its 0th element?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why will it return an array? it is perfectly capable of returning an int.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"numpy.random.randint seems like it would work but it will return an array" - it'll only do that if you tell it to. (Also, if you're using NumPy and you don't <i>want</i> an array, you may be using NumPy wrong.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>action = random.randint(0,2)</code> totally did the trick thank you for all the fast responses!</span>
