<p>Here is the problem from the school. I don't want a complete code back please I am struggling with 1 part of it and that is making the user input be both a string and an integer separated by a comma. That is the main part I am needing assistance with if you could please help with the syntax for that it would be appreciated. (Section 3)</p>
<p>6.7 Program: Data visualization (Python 3)
This section has been set as optional by your instructor.
(1) Prompt the user for a title for data. Output the title. (1 pt)</p>
<p>Ex:</p>
<p>Enter a title for the data: Number of Novels Authored
You entered: Number of Novels Authored</p>
<p>(2) Prompt the user for the headers of two columns of a table. Output the column headers. (1 pt)</p>
<p>Ex:</p>
<p>Enter the column 1 header: Author name
You entered: Author name</p>
<p>Enter the column 2 header: Number of novels
You entered: Number of novels</p>
<p>(3) Prompt the user for data points. Data points must be in this format: string, int. Store the information before the comma into a string variable and the information after the comma into an integer. The user will enter -1 when they have finished entering data points. Output the data points. Store the string components of the data points in a list of strings. Store the integer components of the data points in a list of integers. (4 pts)</p>
<p>Ex:</p>
<p>Enter a data point (-1 to stop input): Jane Austen, 6
Data string: Jane Austen
Data integer: 6</p>
<p>(4) Perform error checking for the data point entries. If any of the following errors occurs, output the appropriate error message and prompt again for a valid data point.</p>
<p>If entry has no comma
Output: Error: No comma in string. (1 pt)
If entry has more than one comma
Output: Error: Too many commas in input. (1 pt)
If entry after the comma is not an integer
Output: Error: Comma not followed by an integer. (2 pts)</p>
<p>Ex:</p>
<p>Enter a data point (-1 to stop input): Ernest Hemingway 9
Error: No comma in string.</p>
<p>Enter a data point (-1 to stop input): Ernest, Hemingway, 9
Error: Too many commas in input.</p>
<p>Enter a data point (-1 to stop input): Ernest Hemingway, nine
Error: Comma not followed by an integer.</p>
<p>Enter a valid data point: Ernest Hemingway, 9
Data string: Ernest Hemingway
Data integer: 9</p>
<p>(5) Output the information in a formatted table. The title is right justified with a minimum field width value of 33. Column 1 has a minimum field width value of 20. Column 2 has a minimum field width value of 23. (3 pts)</p>
<p>Ex:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>        Number of Novels Authored
Author name         |       Number of novels
--------------------------------------------
Jane Austen         |                      6
Charles Dickens     |                     20
Ernest Hemingway    |                      9
Jack Kerouac        |                     22
F. Scott Fitzgerald |                      8
Mary Shelley        |                      7
Charlotte Bronte    |                      5
Mark Twain          |                     11
Agatha Christie     |                     73
Ian Flemming        |                     14
J.K. Rowling        |                     14
Stephen King        |                     54
Oscar Wilde         |                      1
</code></pre>
<p>(6) Output the information as a formatted histogram. Each name is right justified with a minimum field width value of 20. (4 pts)</p>
<p>Ex:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>         Jane Austen ******
     Charles Dickens ********************
    Ernest Hemingway *********
        Jack Kerouac **********************
 F. Scott Fitzgerald ********
        Mary Shelley *******
    Charlotte Bronte *****
          Mark Twain ***********
     Agatha Christie *************************************************************************
        Ian Flemming **************
        J.K. Rowling **************
        Stephen King ******************************************************
         Oscar Wilde *

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you know all of the names in advance, you can easily use a dictionary  and set numbers of novels to 0 and allow the user to change them one at a time.</p>
<pre><code>authors = {'Jane Austen':0 , 'Charles Dickens':0 , 'Stephen King':0}
</code></pre>
<p>It looks from your example that the user will be inputting the author name also.  In which case you will be very close to nearly copy and paste the code here: <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/dictionary" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/dictionary</a></p>
<p>also reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html</a></p>
<p>After you build the dictionary you can use a loop to walk through the dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>for person in authors:
</code></pre>
<p>then use formatted print() to get the data output looking good.</p>
<p>Finally use a for loop to append asterix to a string for the histogram.</p>
<p>Good Luck!  :-}</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Read the user in put as a string, then parse it. You'll need to show some code if you want assistance with where you're going wrong</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I got lost somewhere, can you please provide some sample inputs?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Peter, that answer was what I was missing. I was trying to overthink it. Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, When I was driving home last night it dawned on me that I could just have the user input a string then split the string to adjust each data type but the dict idea sounds good too. I will take a look at the code you put but I don't want to just copy/paste.  I am using this as a learning tool and I don't get class credit for it anyway. It is marked optional. I'll definitely look thorough the resources though and read the code you posted to be able to adapt and write what I need.</span>
