<p>Here is a <strong>Python</strong> code for finding maximum product we can get from 13 adjacent digits of a number. There is no error message, but this program is not giving the desired output. I am getting(in repl.it) <code>1</code> everytime, though it is clear that the answer is not <code>1</code>. I am new to programming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>My attempt</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have converted the number into an string and stored it into a array to get element by element. The outer for loop traversing over all the numbers(last time when <code>i</code> have value <code>len(n)-12</code>, <code>i+j</code> will reach the last entry of the array. (Though the array stores the number in a reverse order, I haven't reversed it because, we don't need to). </p>
<pre><code>n = "123899778978978787888787778788767677667"
arr = []
for i in range(len(n)):
  arr.append(int(n)%10)
  n = str(int(n)//10)

mul = 1
max_mult = 1
for i in range(len(n)-12):
  for j in range(13):
    mul = mul * int(arr[i+j]) 

  if(max_mult&lt;mul):
    max_mult = mul
print(max_mult)
</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone tell me where I am going wrong? Any help will be appreciated. </p>

<p>Your logic can be simplified somewhat using <code>zip</code>:</p>
<pre><code>n_list = list(map(int, list(n)))
res = max(i * j for i, j in zip(n_list, n_list[1:]))  # 81
</code></pre>
<p>If you insist on using a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>n_list = list(map(int, list(n)))
max_mult = 0

for i, j in zip(n_list, n_list[1:]):
    mult = i * j
    if mult &gt; max_mult:
        max_mult = mult

print(max_mult)  # 81
</code></pre>
<p>Note you can modify your existing <code>range</code>-based iteration, but this is not considered Pythonic:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(n_list) - 1):
    mult = n_list[i] * n_list[i+1]
    if mult &gt; max_mult:
        max_mult = mult
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">why not working directly in integer type? why string/int/string ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"this program is not giving the desired output" this isn't good enough. Please explain what you're expecting and what you're getting</span>
<span class="comment-copy">with <code>for i in range(len(n)-12)</code>, <code>i never gets the upper value. Max is </code>len(n)-11``</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can get the list of digits simply by <code>arr = list(n)</code> (given that your <code>n = "123..."</code> is already string).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mkrieger1 thanks, I didn't knew that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you please explain what <code>zip</code> is? when I can use it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure, <code>zip</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks :) .. ..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This code not working :( Can you tell me where you have implimented multiplication of 13 consicutive digits?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@UnknownMathMan, In the <code>i * j</code> part of each loop.</span>
