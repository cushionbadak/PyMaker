<p>I want acces python lists with a hash:</p>
<pre><code>hashtable = []
hashtable.append(132328df455b0028f13bf0abee51a63a: 'foo' )
</code></pre>
<p>But on execution it doesn`t accept the hash as an index:</p>
<pre><code>python3 ./hdd/search.py
  File "./hdd/search.py", line 10
hashtable.append(132328df455b0028f13bf0abee51a63a: 'foo' )
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a possibility to use the list with a hash?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>the datatype that seems to fit your need seems to be the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionary</a>. you can use it this way:</p>
<pre><code>hashtable = {}
hashtable[0x132328df455b0028f13bf0abee51a63a] = 'foo'
# or directly:
# hashtable = {0x132328df455b0028f13bf0abee51a63a: 'foo'}
</code></pre>
<p>and then access the values like this:</p>
<pre><code>value = hashtable[0x132328df455b0028f13bf0abee51a63a]
</code></pre>
<p>note hat <code>132328df455b0028f13bf0abee51a63a</code> is not a valid python integer; you need to prefix hexadecimal numbers with <code>0x</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">did you mean to use a dictionary? <code>hashtable = {}; hashtable[132328df455b0028f13bf0abee51a63a] = 'foo'</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hiroprotagonist I'd suggest making that an answer. OP could possibly want a list of dicts, but that doesn't seem feasible here with what's been provided.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, but after syntax correction it doesn`t work...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"I want acces python lists with a hash" well, you can't do that. Why don't you just use the hashmap data-structure, the <code>dict</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What doesn't work? How are you accessing it? With what @hiroprotagonist suggested, you'd access the value by looking up the key (as opposed to an index number): <code>print(hashtable['132328df455b0028f13bf0abee51a63a'])</code></span>
