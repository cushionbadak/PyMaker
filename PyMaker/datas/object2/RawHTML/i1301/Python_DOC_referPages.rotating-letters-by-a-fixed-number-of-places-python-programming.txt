<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am new to python programming and would like to write a program which has the following requirement:</p>
<p>The program accepts an input string and the number of rotations. Rotate all characters in the string and print the result on screen.</p>
<p>For example, input is ABCDZ 3
Then,
output is DEFGC</p>
<pre><code>def rotate(input,d): 

Rfirst = input[0 : len(input)-d] 
Rsecond = input[len(input)-d : ] 

print "Right Rotation : ", (Rsecond + Rfirst) 
</code></pre>
<p>However, I have written a few codes by myself and turned out that I could only rotate the character within ABCDZ to e.g. ZABCD instead of the rotation pattern dictated in the requirement. </p>
<p>Would anyone like to give help on the issue? How should I start with the correct direction? Thank you very much to all of you. I am really frustrated..</p>

<p>Could this work?</p>
<pre><code>def rotate_str(mstr, n):
  reverse = False
  if n &lt; 0:
    n, reverse = - n, True
  for _ in range (0,n):
    if not reverse: mstr = mstr[-1] + mstr[0:-1]
    if reverse: mstr = mstr[1:] + mstr[0]
  return mstr
</code></pre>
<p>Negative <code>n</code> reverses the direction of rotation.</p>
<pre><code>mstr = 'ABCDZ'
print(rotate_str(mstr, 3)) #=&gt; CDZAB
print(rotate_str(mstr, -4)) #=&gt; ZABCD
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">In your example you "shift" the letters, so a-&gt;d, b-&gt;e... In your code, you change positions of the letters in your input. Decide what you want to do.</span>
