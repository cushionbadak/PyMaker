<p>I'm testing compiling Python code, but when I run the <code>compileall</code> module on a directory with a test file in it, it skips the directory and goes and compiles the Standard Library for some reason. Why is it doing this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're running <code>python -m compileall</code> without specifying a directory, and the module is doing <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/compileall.html#command-line-use" rel="noreferrer">exactly what the documentation says it should</a>: compiling every directory in <code>sys.path</code>.</p>
<p>To compile only the directory you're currently in, pass it on the command line:</p>
<pre><code>$ python -m compileall .
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you need to specify the full path.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">More details needed. Are you running it from the command line with <code>-m</code> or as part of a script you wrote? Are you calling <code>compile_path</code> instead of <code>compile_dir</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Cairnarvon - I'm doing <code>python -m compileall</code> in the directory that the test file is in.</span>
