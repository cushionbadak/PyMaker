<p>I have heard many times that C and Python/Ruby code can be integrated.  </p>
<p>Now, my question is, can I use, for example a Python/Ruby ORM from within C?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, but the API would be unlikely to be very nice, especially because the point of an ORM is to return <em>objects</em> and C doesn't have objects, hence making access to the nice OOP API unwieldy.</p>
<p>Even in C++ is would be problematic as the objects would be Python/Ruby objects and the values Python/Ruby objects/values, and you would need to convert back and forth.</p>
<p>You would be better off using a nice database layer especially made for C.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For Ruby, yes, you can by using the Ruby C API. After including <code>ruby.h</code> you can use <a href="http://www.eqqon.com/index.php/Ruby_C_Extension_API_Documentation_%28Ruby_1.8%29#Invoke_Ruby_method_from_C" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>rb_funcall</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To invoke methods directly, you can use the function below</p>
<pre><code>VALUE rb_funcall(VALUE recv, ID mid, int argc, ...)
</code></pre>
<p>This function invokes a method on the <code>recv</code>, with the method name specified by the symbol <code>mid</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will allow you to call <em>any</em> Ruby method, and thus use any Ruby code from C. It won’t be pretty, though. There are a lot of good resources in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/ruby-c-api/info">SO’s Ruby C API tag wiki</a>.</p>
