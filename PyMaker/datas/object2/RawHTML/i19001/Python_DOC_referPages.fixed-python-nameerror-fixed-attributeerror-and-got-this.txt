<p>FIXED: turns out there is a module already called parser. Renamed it and its working fine! Thanks all. </p>
<p>I got a python NameError I can't figure out, got it after AttributeError. I've tried what I know, can't come up with anything.</p>
<p>main.py:</p>
<pre><code>from random import *
from xml.dom import minidom
import parser
from parser import *
print("+---+ Roleplay Stat Reader +---+")
print("Load previous DAT file, or create new one (new/load file)")
IN=input()
splt = IN.split(' ')
if splt[0]=="new":
    xmlwrite(splt[1])
else:
    if len(splt[1])&lt;2:
        print("err")
    else:
        xmlread(splt[1])
ex=input("Press ENTER to Exit...")
</code></pre>
<p>parser.py:</p>
<pre><code>from xml.dom import minidom
from random import *
def xmlread(doc):
    xmldoc = minidom.parse(doc)
    itemlist = xmldoc.getElementsByTagName('item')
    for s in itemlist:
            print(s.attributes['name'].value,":",s.attributes['value'].value)

def xmlwrite(doc):
    print("no")
</code></pre>
<p>And no matter what I get the error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "K:\Python Programs\Stat Reader\main.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;
    xmlwrite.xmlwrite(splt[1])
NameError: name 'xmlread' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>The same error occurs when trying to access xmlwrite.</p>
<p>When I change xmlread and xmlwrite to parser.xmlread and parser.xmlwrite I get:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "K:\Python Programs\Stat Reader\main.py", line 15, in &lt;module&gt;
    parser.xmlread(splt[1])
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'xmlread'
</code></pre>
<p>The drive is K:\ because it's my personal drive at my school.</p>

<p>If your file is really called parser.xml, that's your problem. <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">It needs to be parser.py in order to work</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay, since that wasn't your issue, it looks like you have a namespacing issue. You import your parser module twice when you use <code>import parser</code> and then <code>from parser import *</code>. The first form of it makes "parser" the namespace and the second form directly imports it, so in theory, you should have both <code>parser.xmlwrite</code> and <code>xmlwrite</code> in scope. It's also clearly not useful to import minidom in main.py since you don't use any minidom functionality in there.</p>
<p>If you clear up those and still have the issue, I would <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448271/what-is-init-py-for">suggest looking at __ init __.py</a>. If that still does nothing, it could just plain be a conflict with <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/parser.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python's parser module</a>, you could substitute a name like myxmlparser.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I would go into the interpreter, import parser, dir(parser), and see if you are importing the right module or if it is importing the std-lib parser module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright I will.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's parser.py, it accesses XML files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually it was simpler. parser is a default package. I renamed it and it worked. But thanks!</span>
