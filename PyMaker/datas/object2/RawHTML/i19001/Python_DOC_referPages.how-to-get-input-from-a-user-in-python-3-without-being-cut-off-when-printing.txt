<p>I am making a basic utility in <strong>Python 3</strong> running on <strong>Windows</strong> with which the user inputs commands and at any given time may receive a printed message. The issue is, when using the <code>input()</code> function if a user is typing in a command and half way through something is printed out into the console, the result may look like this:</p>
<pre><code>this-is-a-command[INFO]User Connected.-that-is-being-cut-off
</code></pre>
<p>In this scenario, the return of the <code>input()</code> command would still be <code>this-is-a-command-that-is-being-cut-off</code> although, this does not look very appealing to the user and may cause confusion. I have tried using various tools such as <code>sys.stdin</code> with only the same results. If anybody knows a solution to this problem, <em>hopefully not using 3rd party modules</em>, that would be great.</p>

<p>You can use a single thread for input and output. Have the threads receiving messages put them into a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html" rel="nofollow">queue</a> or <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque" rel="nofollow">deque</a>. </p>
<p>Then whenever you are not waiting for user input, you can check the queue for messages and output them. For checking for user input without blocking, there is the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/msvcrt.html" rel="nofollow">msvcrt module</a> from the standard library.</p>
<p>Or you use curses <a href="http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net/</a>, there are inofficial builds for python up until 3.2 (<a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses" rel="nofollow">http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses</a>) and build a more advanced interface on top of it.</p>
<p>That being said, I would not choose the windows command line to build something like that.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How do you receive and print the message? In a separate thread?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ThomasFenzl Yes, I am using multiple threads, I realize threading can cause many problems like this, but that is the only way my program will work as intended.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am not sure I fully understand what you are implying, but I would like output to always be able to appear and not have to wait for the user hit enter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think I didn't understand your problem fully. Can you update the question and describe in more detail, what your expected outcome is?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure what else I can explain. To be more specific, I'm making a server that is constantly running, and may be printing out information in a different thread as the user is typing in a command.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So where would you like the messages to go if not to the terminal? Also, windows <code>cmd</code>, powershell, somthing else?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would like the text outputted by the console and the text typed in by the user to appear in the same terminal/cmd window. Just without obstructing each other (output text printed before the text being currently being typed by the user).</span>
