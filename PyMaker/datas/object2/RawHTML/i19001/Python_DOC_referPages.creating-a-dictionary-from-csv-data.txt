<p>I have a function that takes a CSV file and splits it into 3 values; <code>isbn</code>, <code>author</code> and <code>title</code> then creates a dictionary that maps <code>isbn</code> values to tuples containing the <code>author</code> and <code>title</code>. This is my current code:</p>
<pre><code>def isbn_dictionary(filename):
    file = open(filename, 'r')
    for line in file:
        data = line.strip('\n')
        author, title, isbn = data.split(',') 
        isbn_dict = {isbn:(author, title)}
        print(isbn_dict)
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that at the moment I can get it to create a dictionary for each <code>isbn</code> but not one for all of them. My current output is:</p>
<pre><code>{'0-586-08997-7': ('Kurt Vonnegut', 'Breakfast of Champions')}
{'978-0-14-302089-9': ('Lloyd Jones', 'Mister Pip')}
{'1-877270-02-4': ('Joe Bennett', 'So Help me Dog')}
{'0-812-55075-7': ('Orson Scott Card', 'Speaker for the Dead')}
</code></pre>
<p>What my output should be:</p>
<pre><code>{'0-586-08997-7': ('Kurt Vonnegut', 'Breakfast of Champions'),
'978-0-14-302089-9': ('Lloyd Jones', 'Mister Pip'),
'1-877270-02-4': ('Joe Bennett', 'So Help me Dog'),
'0-812-55075-7': ('Orson Scott Card', 'Speaker for the Dead')}
</code></pre>
<p>It's probably a really simple issue but I cannot get my head around it.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to declare <code>isbn_dict</code> before the loop, like this:</p>
<pre><code>def isbn_dictionary(filename):
    file = open(filename, 'r')
    isbn_dict = {}
    for line in file:
        data = line.strip('\n')
        author, title, isbn = data.split(',') 
        isbn_dict[isbn] = (author, title)
    print(isbn_dict)
</code></pre>
<p>This way, each item is added to the existing dictionary.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>csv</code> module</a> for easier and more efficient processing, and a dict comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

def isbn_dictionary(filename):
    with open(filename, newline='') as infile:
        reader = csv.reader(infile)
        return {isbn: (author, title) for isbn, author, title in reader}
</code></pre>
<p>Your code only created a dictionary <em>per line</em> and only printed the dictionary. You probably wanted to <em>return</em> the dictionary instead.</p>
<p>Using a dict comprehension not only makes the function more compact, it is also more efficient. The dictionary is created in one go, in C code, instead of in a Python loop adding keys and values one by one.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Like the OP, you don't actually <i>return</i> the resulting dictionary. Printing is a nice debug tool, but doesn't make the function very useful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlcariTheMad Also you should <code>close</code> the file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlcariTheMad Thanks for your answer, I knew it would be relatively simple.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's better to use <code>with open(...) as localname:</code>, that way the file is closed automatically when the <code>with</code> block ends.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters Thanks, I didn't think of that, I'll keep that in mind</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer. I should have noticed that in my code, I actually should be returning and not printing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Although @AlcariTheMad fixes the bug in OP's code, this is the most Pythonic answer</span>
