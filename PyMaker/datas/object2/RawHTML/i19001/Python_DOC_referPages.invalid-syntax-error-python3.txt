<p>The traceback is pretty clear. You have a file, with the same name, as standard Python module -

<span class="comment-copy">It's a different problem, but it doesn't seem to explain the syntax error with <code>print</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chepner, Perhaps, code in <code>/home/twitches/Documents/types.py</code> is written for Python 2.x, this way this line throws an error. Is it what you're asking about?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The OP has already said he used parentheses in his <code>type.py</code>, but the error is showing a parentheses-less call. There might be a mismatch here, where the file being imported is not the one the OP thinks is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chepner, The OP doesn't said, that he used parentheses in <b>type.py</b>. He just said: <code>I used () with my print in line 6</code> - it may be another file, since given <i>line 6</i> by the OP <code>print("Hello")</code> is differs from <i>line 6</i> from traceback. I think, he doesn't understand, which file threw the error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good point: <code>x</code> vs "hello"</span>
