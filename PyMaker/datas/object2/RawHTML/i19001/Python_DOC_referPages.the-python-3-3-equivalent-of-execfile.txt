<p>I need to find out how to open my <em>.py</em> files after writing them in Notepad++. I find the interface more useful than the Python window.</p>
<p>In a tutorial I was following along with the guy uses</p>
<pre><code>execfile(pathway)
</code></pre>
<p>but execfile does not work in 3.3.</p>
<p>Is there an equivalent statement in 3.x?</p>

<p>Open your file, read it, and pass its contents to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow"><code>exec</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>with open('file.py') as source_file:
    exec(source_file.read())
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">In windows try with the drive letter, like <code>r"C:\Users\path\to\the\file"</code> or with a starting backslash. If you are generating the file path with <code>os.path</code>, use <code>os.path.abspath</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">C:\Users\Deaven and Teigan\Documents\Python Projects  is the location in the properties. Yet the program doesn't find it. Sometimes these simple commands give major hedaches</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is anyone familiar with Notepad ++? there is a 'Run' command in the toolbar on top but it seems to be set up for javascript because the defaults are to run in web browsers. I can choose the application but I try python.exe and pythonw.exe by clicking on the icons in the Python33 directory and it does nothing.</span>
