<p>I want to search and replace the character '№' in a string. 
I am not sure if it's actually a single character or two.
How do I do it? What is its unicode?
If it's any help, I am using Python3.</p>
<p>EDIT: The sentence "I am not sure if it's actually a single character or two" kind of deformed my question. I actually wanted to know its unicode so that I could use the code instead of pasting the character in my python script.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That character is <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2116/index.htm" rel="nofollow">U+2116 ɴᴜᴍᴇʀᴏ sɪɢɴ</a>.</p>
<p>You can just type it directly in your source file, taking care to to specify the source file encoding as per <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/" rel="nofollow">PEP-236</a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use either the numeric Unicode escapes, or the more readable <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow">named Unicode escapes</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'foo\u2116'
'foo№'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'foo\N{NUMERO SIGN}'
'foo№'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python 3 it is always a single character.</p>
<pre><code>3&gt;&gt; 'foo№bar'.replace('№', '#')
'foo#bar'
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you actually have a problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MisterBhoot I recognized this one on sight, but for future reference, when I find such a character in text I can copy from, I paste it into BabelMap and get its code point from there. If you cannot use BabelMap you can probably find some alternative, or even some online service.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '№'.encode("unicode_escape")</code> <code>b'\\u2116'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>3&gt;&gt;hex(ord('№'))</code> <code>'0x2116'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think it would be helpful to add your comment about decompositions to the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@thg435 I don't think that comment makes sense outside of its context (i.e. where the comment it is replying to exists).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Up to you, just thought that would clarify OP's and others confusion about "one character or two".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is that <code>3&gt;&gt;</code> supposed to be there (showing you are using Python 3?)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jamylak: Yes. I've set it in my Python 3.x <code>site.py</code> so that I can keep my various Python interpreters straight.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IgnacioVazquez-Abrams - OK. What I want is the encoding for it. I didn't want to copy-paste the character in my script. Martinho's comment did that job. Sorry for my confusing question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MisterBhoot: Characters don't have encodings. Your source code might, but that will be declared at the top of the file (or assumed to be UTF-8).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MisterBhoot: That would be the "Unicode escape sequence".</span>
