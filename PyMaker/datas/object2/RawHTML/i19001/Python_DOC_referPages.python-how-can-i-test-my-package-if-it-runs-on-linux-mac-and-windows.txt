<p>I need to test my Python package if it works properly on different systems. I found <em>Tox</em> for different Python versions, but what about different operating systems like Windows, Linux and Mac. </p>
<p>Can you recommend me a convenient way to test if my code works on all systems?</p>

<p>You'll need (possibly virtual) machines running one of each operating system. Personally, I just run my unit tests on different physical machines, but nearly all of my code is operating-system independent, so I can do most of my development on one operating system during the day and just run the tests on the other OSes at the end of the day.</p>
<p>If you have operating-system dependent code (e.g., Windows handles the Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow"><code>multiprocessing</code></a> package differently from Unix), you can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#skipping-tests-and-expected-failures" rel="nofollow"><code>unittest</code> module's skip functionality</a> to skip tests of, say, Windows behavior when you're running the tests on Mac OS.</p>
