<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am making a simple text based game but I can't even get past the second line of code.  My code so far looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>print("Welcome To City Text!  First You Must Name Your City.")
</code></pre>
<p>Then the person is supposed to type a name and the shell will print "Welcome To "Town Name" City" The problem is I don't know how to do this.  Does anyone know how to do this?</p>

<p>From the fact that you're using <code>print("text")</code> rather than <code>print "text"</code>, I assume you're using Python 3.x rather than Python 2.x. In that case, <code>raw_input</code> won't work, because that was renamed <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input</code></a> (the original <code>input</code> function did <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">something else</a>, and was removed entirely).</p>
<p>So, if you're getting a NameError when you use <code>raw_input</code>, just replace it with <code>input</code>.</p>
<p>(If you <em>aren't</em> getting a NameError, you're using Python 2.x, and you should leave out the parenthesis around the string you're printing; in Python 2.x, <code>print</code> is a <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-print-statement" rel="nofollow">statement</a>, not a function. It will still work with the parentheses, but it's just going to create confusion.)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The line raw_input() lets you get the input from the console. The argument you pass it is the line it prints before getting the input. So your code would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>var_name=raw_input("Welcome To City Text! First You Must Name Your City.")
</code></pre>
<p>this will print: Welcome To City Text! First You Must Name Your City. then let you type until you hit enter and return what you typed.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>x=raw_input()</code> to get a string from the keyboard.</p>
<p>If you google "python input text from console" you will get lots of answers.</p>
<p>You can put the result into another string using</p>
<pre><code>print("hello %s." % x)
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use</p>
<pre><code>print("hello "+x+".")
</code></pre>
<p>which does more or less the same thing.</p>
<p>You can find more about this by googling for "formatting strings in python" or "concatenating strings in python"</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Okay thanks for the help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In Python 3, this is <code>x = input()</code> and <code>"hello {}.".format(x)</code>.</span>
