<p>I believe that what you're looking for is called slicing not subtraction and specifically in line 3. <br/> <br/>It's working okay when I run the code you've pasted here in idle and this is because the else statements should take care of any type errors from user input.<br/> You can however read more on strings and how slicing.

<span class="comment-copy">You need to explain what "doesn't work" means.  Do you get an error message?  If so, what is it?  What does the program not do that you want it to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What does this have to do with subtraction?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Enter a word :                                                         hablar                                                             Traceback (most recent call last):   File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 4, in &lt;module&gt; TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'                  this is what it says when i hit enter</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You haven't defined what your actual problem is, but if you choose an ER verb then you never actually set the ar_verb variable which is what you're checking for in your second block of conditional statements. The code is very incomplete, you should finish the code and then post any questions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2387706 -- that error doesn't occur with the code you pasted above (There is only one "<code>-</code>" and it isn't doing subtraction).  I think you have some other errors (potential <code>NameError</code> with <code>ar_verb</code> for instance) -- But that will not lead to the type error you described.</span>
