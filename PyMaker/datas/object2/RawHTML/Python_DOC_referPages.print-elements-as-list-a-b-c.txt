<p>I am creating this program that takes in a set of values which look like a tic tac toe game board in my function. then it prints out the the column number of each row (which the user specifies). however when I run the code it prints out like X 0 0 or something but is there a way to make it to print out like ['X', 'O', 'O'] with the brackets etc?</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<pre><code>def get_column(board, col_num):
    """takes 3x3 game and returns 3 elemtn list containg all values from column number top to bottom"""

    print(board[0][col_num])
    print(board[1][col_num])
    print(board[2][col_num])

get_column( [['O', 'X', 'O'],
         ['X', ' ', ' '],
         ['X', ' ', ' ']], 2)

<p>Put everything you want to print into a list, then return the list.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Try <code>pprint.pprint(board)</code> (you should first <code>import pprint</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is actually a problem for class and our class hasn't gone over that, so I doubt we'd have to use that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I feel like my logic might just be wrong in general. If i have the output for col_num as 0  , it outputs the right x's and o's but also says 'None' on the next line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I get the right output but on the next line it also says 'None'?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't see that here: <a href="https://ideone.com/TuSFRe" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ideone.com/TuSFRe</a> I think that's an artifact of the interactive Python you're using, it's showing the return value of <code>print()</code>, but it doesn't return anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that's what it shows me, and it's not letting me continue because it's 'wrong' <a href="https://imgur.com/a/BJaIZwm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">imgur.com/a/BJaIZwm</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is that, a coding competition site? You probably shouldn't be printing the result, just returning it.</span>
