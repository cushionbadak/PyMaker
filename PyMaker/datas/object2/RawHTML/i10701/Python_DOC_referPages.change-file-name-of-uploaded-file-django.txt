<p>this is what I am trying to do. I created a method that will upload a file however, I would like to change its file name. I was able to change the filename but I also lost the extension.</p>
<p>this is how my codes look:</p>
<pre><code>def upload_delivery_to_media(self,deliveryId, deliveryFile):

    with open('/app/media/TaskDelivery/'+str(delivery), 'wb+') as destination:
        for chunk in deliveryFile.chunks():
            destination.write(chunk)

    return "Done uploading"
</code></pre>
<p>but the file looks like <code>324329432840932</code> only when I am expecting something like <code>324329432840932.jpg</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's better to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.splitext" rel="nofollow">splitext</a> instead of method <code>split()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import os
from django.conf import settings

def upload_delivery_to_media(self, delivery_id, delivery_file):
    _, ext = os.path.splitext(delivery_file.name)
    with open(os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, 'TaskDelivery', '{}{}'.format(delivery_id, ext)), 'wb') as destination:
        for chunk in delivery_file.chunks():
            destination.write(chunk)       
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>str(delivery)</code> should be <code>str(deliveryId)</code>, right? And you can append a <code>.jpg</code> to filename.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well I also did it but not all the files are .jpg only. some of the them are .gif, .pdf etc</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can split original filename at <code>.</code>  and store extension.  And then append it to your new filename.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, that is exactly what I wanted to do.... Thanks... I will search about it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can do <code>extn=filename.split('.')[1]</code>. And then <code>newname + '.' + extn</code>.</span>
