<p>Ok, I am creating a game and no matter what I do, it just isn't working. So I have 3 numbers chosen, 25,50,75.
I want to be able to random pick one of them. Then I will need to be able to add it to a total making it obviously an integer. I have imported random. I have tried random.sample but I can't get that one to be an number that I can add. I tried random.randint and that did not work at all. I have tried looking it up but it is pretty much all random in a range and not specific. Any ideas? Thanks in advance. I am using python 3.4.3. </p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow"><code>random.choice</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice([25,50,75])
25
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice([25,50,75])
25
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice([25,50,75])
75
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow"><code>random.choice()</code></a> is the way to go, however, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow"><code>random.sample()</code></a> will also work if you use a sample size of 1 <em>and</em> you access the first element of the returned list.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = [25, 50, 75]
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice(data)
50
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.sample(data, 1)
[75]
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.sample(data, 1)[0]
25
</code></pre>
<p>The point here is that <code>random.sample()</code> returns a <em>list</em> because that function is designed to select multiple values from the population. That's why you can not immediately use the result as an integer.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Oh ya, how could I forget that one. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That makes sense and the way you fix that is by adding that [0] at the end I noticed. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that <code>[0]</code> is a subscript into the list... it means the 0th element, ie. the first element in the list.</span>
