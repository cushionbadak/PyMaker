<p>I want to handle <code>http.client.BadStatusLine: ''</code> exception.
I am on python3. My code is </p>
<pre><code>import http.client

try:
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers={'User-Agent': 'Chrome/51'})
    html = urllib.request.urlopen(req).read()
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html,"html.parser")
    return soup
except http.client.HTTPException as eror:
    print("Boom")
</code></pre>
<p>but <code>httpException</code> is not in python3? <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fFbLd.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="Figure" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fFbLd.png"/></a> </p>
<p>I read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8734617/python-django-badstatusline-error">stackOverFloeQuestion</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29981182/python-3-urllib-exception-http-client-badstatusline">this</a> but unable to catch it. Any help?</p>

<p>You need to make up your mind :-). You can either use <code>http.client</code> or <code>urllib.request</code>, but you should not use one and then try to catch errors from the other. If you want to stick with urllib.request, the class to catch is <code>urllib.error.HTTPError</code>.</p>
<p>Perhaps it may be more opportune in your case to use <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/" rel="nofollow">Requests</a>, which is a higher level http library.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It is in the docs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPException" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a>  What is the actual error that you recieve?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DeepSpace. I want to catch this exception. That is it. Red sign in the above picture is showing that <code>HTTPException</code> is not defined.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Copy-pasting your code doesn't reproduce that issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Copy-Pasting? Sorry . You did not understand the question. @Hans Then resolve it. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want to be specific to <code>BadStatusLine</code> Exception. Not whole <code>HTTPError</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this is logically correct, it still doesn't explain why would <code>http.client.HTTPException</code> be not defined. Especially when copy-pasting OPs code doesn't reproduce the issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes it seems logically correct. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes it seems logically correct. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think BadStatusLine is defined in httplib. So perhaps try <code>import httplib.BadStatusLine</code> and catch that error.</span>
