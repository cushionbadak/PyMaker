<p>I am trying to launch a program/GUI from within a python code.</p>
<p>From the terminal, I can get the program to launch by simply typing the program name. A few lines get outputted to the terminal, and then a separate window opens with the GUI. </p>
<p>I tried to emulate this in python by running</p>
<pre><code>os.system("&lt;program name&gt;")
</code></pre>
<p>The typical output lines, as mentioned above, get printed to the console, but no window opens up with the GUI.</p>
<p>Can os.system() be used to execute programs that have their own separate window?</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system" rel="nofollow">Python manual</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system" rel="nofollow"><code>os.system</code></a>] is implemented by calling the Standard C function
  <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/system" rel="nofollow"><code>system()</code></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That being said, you shouldn't have any problems launching a GUI application with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system" rel="nofollow"><code>os.system</code></a>. I've just tried it myself and it works fine.</p>
<p>It also mentions in the manual that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow">subprocess</a> module provides more powerful facilities for spawning
  new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is
  preferable to using this function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe that's worth a try. Do any other GUI applications work when you spawn them with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system" rel="nofollow"><code>os.system</code></a>?</p>

<p>Here is a solution using <code>subprocess</code></p>
<pre><code>import subprocess

subprocess.Popen("notepad.exe")
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you want to run a python program with a specific interpreter:</p>
<pre><code>subprocess.Popen('{0} {1}'.format(PythonInterpreterPath,PythonFilePath.py))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Take a look into the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess</code></a> module for more flexible process creation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just ran <code>os.system('subl test.txt')</code> and it opened the GUI just like normal. Running Python 3.5.1 on Windows 10, for reference. Though I may be misunderstanding the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks like this may be related to a larger (more scary) problem, as suddenly I can't load the program at all (among other important problems, such as not being able to any new files or load nautilus). Thanks though, I'll know it should work now!</span>
