<p>I want to do something like this.</p>
<pre><code>example_string = "test"
print(example_string.replace(example_string[0], "b"))
</code></pre>
<p>expecting the output</p>
<pre><code>best
</code></pre>
<p>however because the letter "t" is being passed into the method the t at the end also gets replaced with a "b". Resulting in the output</p>
<pre><code>besb
</code></pre>
<p>How do I do it in a way that would result in the output "best" instead of "besb"?</p>

<p>The problem is that <code>.replace(old, new)</code> returns a copy of the string in which the occurrences of <code>old</code> have been replaced with <code>new</code>.</p>
<p>Instead, you can swap the character at index <code>i</code> using:</p>
<pre><code>new_str = old_str[:i] + "b" + old_str[i+1:]
</code></pre>

<p>Check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>You can use</p>
<pre><code>example_string.replace(example_string[0], "b", 1)
</code></pre>
<p>though it would be much more natural to use a slice to replace just the first character, as @nbryans indicated in a comment.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You may want to try something like <code>new_str = "b" + example_string[1:]</code> . <code>replace(a,b)</code> is used for swapping all occurrences of string <code>a</code> with <code>b</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand, you want to substitute the first 't' character of a string with 'b' ?  Or is the index the key to decide what to replace (instead of the t)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Lynch: That's for replacing the <i>first</i> occurrence of a substring, not a <i>specific</i> occurrence of a substring.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I cant answer because its closed, but now I understand. This should works: <code>word = "test"; i = word.index('t', 2); word[0:i] + "b" + word[i+1:]</code>. Of course if you know the id of the char you want to replace instead of a letter you can directly set the variable <code>i</code>. If you need to substitue strings you could adapt it using the <code>i+len(substring)+1</code> to determine where the string ends.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That works for this case, but then what if you want to replace <code>example_string[3]</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that your question was specifically how to replace the first occurrence of a character. (see <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem">XY Problem</a>)  This is a different question.  Don't use <code>replace()</code> where it is not appropriate, then.  As noted, use slices when you want to act upon a particular location of a string (or other sequence such as a list or tuple).  So for your new question: <code>s = example_string[:3] + "b" + example_string[4:]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That works for this case, but then what if you want to replace <code>example_string[3]</code>?</span>
