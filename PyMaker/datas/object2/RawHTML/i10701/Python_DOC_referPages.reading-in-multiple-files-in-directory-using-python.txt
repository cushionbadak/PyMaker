<p>I'm trying to open each file from a directory and print the contents, so I have a code as such:</p>
<pre><code>import os, sys

def printFiles(dir):
    os.chdir(dir)
    for f in os.listdir(dir):
        myFile = open(f,'r')
        lines = myFile.read()
        print lines
        myFile.close()

printFiles(sys.argv[1])
</code></pre>
<p>The program runs, but the problem here is that it is only printing one of the contents of the file, probably the last file that it has read. Does this have something to do with the open() function?</p>
<p>Edit: added last line that takes in sys.argv. That's the whole code, and it still only prints the last file.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is problem with directory and file paths.</p>
<p>Option 1 - chdir:</p>
<pre><code>def printFiles(dir):
    os.chdir(dir)
    for f in os.listdir('.'):
        myFile = open(f,'r')
        # ...
</code></pre>
<p>Option 2 - computing full path:</p>
<pre><code>def printFiles(dir):
    # no chdir here
    for f in os.listdir(dir):
        myFile = open(os.path.join(dir, f), 'r')
        # ...
</code></pre>
<p>But you are combining both options - that's wrong.</p>
<p>This is why I prefer <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#basic-use" rel="nofollow"><code>pathlib.Path</code></a> - it's much simpler:</p>
<pre><code>from pathlib import Path

def printFiles(dir):
    dir = Path(dir)
    for f in dir.iterdir():
        myFile = f.open()
        # ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The code itself certainly should print the contents of every file.
However, if you supply a local path and not a global path it will not work.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you have the following folder structure:</p>
<pre><code>./a
./a/x.txt
./a/y.txt
./a/a
./a/a/x.txt 
</code></pre>
<p>If you now run</p>
<pre><code>printFiles('a')
</code></pre>
<p>you will only get the contents of <em>x.txt</em>, because <em>os.listdir</em> will be executed from within <em>a</em>, and will list the contents of the internal <em>a/a</em> folder, which only has <em>x.txt</em>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure? What happens if you just print <code>f</code> within your loop - how many filenames is it showing it's looping over?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JonClements when I <code>print f</code> it does print all the file names in the directory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@maregor Are some files empty for instance?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JonClements no, they all have contents. It still prints the last file of any directory only.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you call <code>os.chdir()</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm having difficulty getting the first and second options to work. They still result in printing the last file only... I prefer if I didn't have to import but I would use it if no other options are available.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@maregor: it works for me... <a href="https://gist.github.com/messa/a257e5dd3522b5cae883ea886f6dc64a#file-example-txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">gist.github.com/messa/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So it does... I tried editing my code to have the same exact lines as yours and it doesn't work, but when I copy paste your code into mines it does. It completely bewilders me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@maregor: Are you mixing tabs and spaces? :) If that <code>print</code> line ends up on the same level as the <code>for</code> (instead of being in the <code>for</code> block) it would have the exact same results as you are reporting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I think that was the cause.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did supply the full path, and I had only 3 files in it, but it would just print out the last file in any directory that I put into it.</span>
