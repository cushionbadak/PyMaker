<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a set of data like</p>
<pre><code>schedule = [(2, 5),
            (4, 6),
            (10, 2)]
</code></pre>
<p>with the first element of each tuple being a time (in seconds) and the second element being a value.</p>
<p>I would like to start a separate thread which tracks the time and at each scheduled time runs some arbitrary function <code>func(value)</code>.</p>
<p>What is the cleanest way to do this? I could create a Timer object for each scheduled time, but that seems sloppy.</p>
<p>edit: You can assume the times are in ascending order</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you need them to be in separate threads then a Timer object or as a commenter pointed out APScheduler. If you want to do the threading manually you could also use sched. They added support for threads in version 3.3. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html" rel="nofollow">Docs</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are the times necessarily in ascending order?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I'm sorting them from the start, but if there is a robust solution that doesn't make the assumption that they are sorted, that is great too</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Probably overkill but if this is for a big project or might grow, consider <a href="http://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/v3.2.0/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">APScheduler</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, this is a small part of a small project that probably wont go anywhere</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sched (in a separate thread)  worked perfectly here. Just what I needed.</span>
