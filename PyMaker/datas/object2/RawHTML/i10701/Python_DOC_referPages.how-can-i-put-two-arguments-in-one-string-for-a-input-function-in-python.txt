<p>I am pretty new to python and am trying to create a small game just to help develop my skills, but I ran in to one code line I just can't figure out.</p>
<pre><code>r = str(input("Player 1 please enter a integer between 1 and 10: "))
</code></pre>
<p>I have another line that goes earlier and asks the player for a name.         </p>
<p><code>name = input('Player 1 what is your name? ')</code></p>
<p>but I want it so that instead of it saying </p>
<p><code>r = str(input("Player 1 please enter a integer between 1 and 10: "))</code></p>
<p>that it says the name of the player I got from the input earlier on in the code?
How can I do this?</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#old-string-formatting" rel="nofollow">formated string</a>:</p>
<pre><code>r = str(input("%s please enter a integer between 1 and 10: " % player_name))
</code></pre>
<p><code>input</code> expects a string. So, first you construct a approprate string and then pass it. Simplified example of <code>%</code></p>
<pre><code>"%s is good" % "he" # transforms to "he is good"
</code></pre>
<p><code>%</code> It is a sort of substitution operation with type checking, eg.<code>%s</code> specifies string type.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use string formatting for this.</p>
<pre><code>r = str(input("%s please enter a integer between 1 and 10: " % name))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also do this since you are working with integers:</p>
<p>However, this solution will only work in Python 2</p>
<pre><code>player_name = raw_input("What is your name")
r = int(input("%s Enter a number:" % player_name))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I strongly suggest that you use (according to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/" rel="nofollow">PEP-3101</a>)  :</p>
<pre><code>r = str(input('{} please enter a integer between 1 and 10: '.format(name)))
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of using the modulo operator (%) like :</p>
<pre><code>r = str(input("%s please enter a integer between 1 and 10: " % name))
</code></pre>
