<p>I have project in python, structure of my project like this :</p>
<pre><code>def makeRecommendation:

<p><strong>My laptop " Core i7 with number of cores : 4, processors(logical processors) : 8</strong></p>
<p>Everytime i run my project, its run only one processor. I want make all 8 processors running, i read about Multithreading but not really understand how to make all 8 processors run in my laptop.</p>
<p>How i can make 8 processors with my project ?</p>
<p>Thanks very much for help me !</p>

<p>Python's multithreading cannot make use of multicore. The only way is to use multi-processing. There are several modules that you could use:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow">multiprocessing</a>: This module gives you complete control over new process.<br/>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html" rel="nofollow">concurrent.futures</a>: This is more convenient, it allows you to create a process pool quickly.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What would running your project on 8 processors help you accomplish? I don't see any multi-threading in your project that would be aided by additional processors.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Multiprocessing for using multiple cores. Multi-threading uses a single core only</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think about <code>import multiprocessing</code> or <code>import threading</code> but don't know how to write it in my poroject.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @laike9m . Can you give me example if i want use multicore with values in dictionary. I mean if i have dictionary with 10  pairs key:value, and i set 5 cores then program run 5 pairs key:value in one time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure what you mean……You can always pass arguments to new process no matter which one you use.</span>
