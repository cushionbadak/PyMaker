<p>Currently working on an assignment where I want to print stars as triangles, the code is currently looking like this (very basic, I know):</p>
<pre><code>def triangelbasupp(n,m):
    for a in range(0,m):
        print((n*" "),(m*"*"))
        m=m-2
        n=n+1
        if m&lt;=0:
            break
</code></pre>
<p>When I enter, for example (3,1) I will get first 3 stars in the first row, then 1 star. This code is working fine, the problem is that for the assignment, I want to ONLY return the whole string that constitutes the triangle, it also has to contain the '\n' for switching row. Does anyone have a clue how I can do this?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of printing, initialize an  empty string and use the string concatenation operator to build the string:</p>
<pre><code>def triangelbasupp(n,m):
    s = ""
    for a in range(0,m):
        s += n*" " + m*"*" + "\n"
        m=m-2
        n=n+1
        if m&lt;=0:
            break
    return s
</code></pre>

<p>Collect the lines in a list, then <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow"><code>join</code></a> them with <code>\n</code> and return.</p>
<pre><code>def triangelbasupp(n,m):
    lines = []
    for a in range(0,m):
        lines.append(n*" " + m*"*")
        ...
    return "\n".join(lines)
</code></pre>
<p>Or shorter:</p>
<pre><code>def triangelbasupp(n, m):
    return "\n".join(("*"*i).center(n) for i in range(m, 0, -2))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Try to append all your sting values in a single string alongwith "\n", wherever required and at last print that string.</span>
