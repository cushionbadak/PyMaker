<p>I currently sitting on a macbook, and therefore i'm using Terminal. Anyway, I have created an adventure game in a file called adventure.py. The thing I want to do is to send a parameter to that file, for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>-h/ --help That explains what parameters that work</li>
<li>-i/ --info Gives a description of the game</li>
<li>-v/ --version Gives the version of the game</li>
<li>-c/ --cheat Gives out cheats for the game or a explanation of how to complete the game as fast as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>What i'm guessing it that in terminal you write: adventure.py --version for example. But I dont know how to get started with this or how to even implement this. I've tried to google for an answer but havent found anything.</p>
<p>Thanks. :)</p>

<p>You can also try <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow">argparse</a> - it's a Python package for doing exactly this. Examples, etc. are all in the documentation.</p>
