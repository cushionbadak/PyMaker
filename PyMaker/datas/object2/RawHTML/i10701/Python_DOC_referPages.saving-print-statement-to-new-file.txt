<p>New to python (should be noted). Go easy on me. </p>
<p>I have written the following to isolate a very specific part of a file</p>
<pre><code>for line in open('120301.KAP'):
    rec = line.strip()
    if rec.startswith('PLY'):
       print line
</code></pre>
<p>the output appears as such </p>
<pre><code>PLY/1,48.107478621032,-69.733975000000

PLY/2,48.163516399836,-70.032838888053

<p>Ideally what I am hoping for is the output to create a CSV file with the coordinates. (The PLY/1, PLY/2 etc. Does not need to stay). Is this doable? If not, at least can the print statement result in a new textfile with the same name as the KAP file?    </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is totally doable! Here are a couple links to some docs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html</a> #for writing/reading CSV.
You could also just make your own CSV with the regular file reading/writing functions. </p>
<pre><code>file = open('data', rw)
output = open('output.csv', w)
file.write('your infos') #add a comma to each string you output?
</code></pre>
<p>i think that should work. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could open the file at the beginning of your code and then just add a write statement after the print line.  Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>target = open(filename, 'w')
for line in open('120301.KAP'):
rec = line.strip()
if rec.startswith('PLY'):
   print line
   target.write(line)
   target.write("\n") #writes a new line
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can use csv module</p>
<pre><code>import csv  

with open('120301.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    for line in open('120301.KAP'):
        rec = line.strip()
        if rec.startswith('PLY'):
            writer.writerow(rec.split(','))
</code></pre>
<p>In the similar way <code>csv.reader</code> can easily read records from your input file.

<p><strong>edit #1</strong></p>
<p>In python 2.x you should open the file in binary mode:</p>
<pre><code>import csv  

with open('120301.csv', 'wb') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    for line in open('120301.KAP'):
        rec = line.strip()
        if rec.startswith('PLY'):
            writer.writerow(rec.split(','))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The simplest way is to redirect stdout to a file:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10):
   print str(i) + "," + str(i*2)   
</code></pre>
<p>will output:</p>
<pre><code>0,0
1,2
2,4
3,6
4,8
5,10
6,12
7,14
8,16
9,18
</code></pre>
<p>if you run it as <code>python myprog.py &gt; myout.txt</code> the result go to myout.txt                         </p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's quite different, read my question in its entirety</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This doesn't seem to work? Not sure what filename is supposed to be defining?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">filename here is a variable (string), you should just pass it the name of the file you want to open, such as "file.csv"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">TypeError: 'newline' is an invalid keyword argument for this function</span>
