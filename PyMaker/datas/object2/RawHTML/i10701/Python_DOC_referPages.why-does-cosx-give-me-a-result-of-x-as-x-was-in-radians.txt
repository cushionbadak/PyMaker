<p>I am using Python but there is something strange. Why does cos(x) give me a result of x as was in radians? while cos(radians(x)) gives the answer as x was in degree</p>
<p>for example :</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cos(75)
0.9217512697247493 
</code></pre>
<p>but the truth is if 75 is in degree, then cos(75) = 0.26 </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cos(radians(75))
0.25881904510252074 
</code></pre>
<p>but the truth is if 75 is in radians, then cos(75) = 0.90</p>
<p>I am wrong ? why is that happening ? </p>

<ul>
<li><code>cos(75)</code> means "the cosine of 75 radians". (See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#trigonometric-functions">documentation</a>.)</li>
<li><code>radians(75)</code> means "convert 75° to radians", i.e. "the number of radians that's equivalent to 75°". (See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#angular-conversion">documentation</a>.)</li>
<li>so <code>cos(radians(75))</code> means "the cosine of {the number of radians that's equivalent to 75°} radians", i.e. "the cosine of 75°".</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">From the docs, <code>Return the cosine of x (measured in radians).</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The calculator on my machine gives <code>cos(75)</code> as 0.9217512697…  Using <code>bc -l &lt;&lt;&lt; 'cos(75)'</code> yields 0.92175126972474931639 (adding a leading zero).  Your 0.90 seems to be a poor approximation to what you should be expecting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Every language I know uses radians for trig functions; none use degrees as inputs. FORTRAN, C, C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Scala - you get the idea.  Make it easy - find a language that uses radians for angles natively.  I'll be surprised if there is one.</span>
