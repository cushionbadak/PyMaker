<p>I have been researching this question, and it seems that it is possible, but not possible on Windows.</p>
<p>I am trying to achieve a loading bar that will print 'Loading', then 'Loading.', 'Loading..'... etc.</p>
<p>This code seems to work on Linux but not Windows(Python 3.5):</p>
<pre><code>x = 0
for x in range (0,5):
    #x = x + 1
    b = "Loading" + "." * x
    print (b, end="\r")
    time.sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p>How do I combat this problem?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is buffering: everything appears at once when the script ends. You can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow">force Python &gt;3.3 to flush after each print output</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import time
print("Loading", end="", flush=True)
for x in range(0,5):
  print(".", end="", flush=True)
  time.sleep(.2)
</code></pre>
<p>Of course a loading bar may look cool, but a fake one that just wastes time sleeping is not going to make the user happy. If your program really is doing business, have a look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html" rel="nofollow">threading</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow">subprocess</a>.</p>
<p><hr/>
Your original idea works for me (Python 3.4 on Win7 64 bit), too:</p>
<pre><code>import time
for x in range(0,5):
  print("Loading" + "."*x, end="\r", flush=True)
  time.sleep(.2)
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">@jmpc - looks like they're having a problem actually getting that to work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What output do you get instead? Also, <i>this</i> code won't work on any platform. You need to copy the code from your editor.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jpmc26: seems to me the OP is trying to follow the accepted answer.  Try putting a <code>\r</code> at the start of the string.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, it was just a waste if time at the start of a program to make it look better - it was just a 'robot' booting up.</span>
