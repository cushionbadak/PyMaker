<p>In some exception handling code, I'd like to perform an emergency shutdown operation and then re-raise the exception. I am using an asynchronous programming model (Twisted), and I would like to re-raise the exception in the emergency shutdown's callback.</p>
<p>I'd like to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>except Exception as e:
    d = emergencyStop()
    d.addCallback(partial(raiseExn, e))
</code></pre>
<p>I could define my own <code>raiseExn</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>def raiseExn(e):
    raise e
</code></pre>
<p>But it seems silly to add three or four lines to every place I want to use this code. I expect that the <code>raise</code> keyword probably calls a function somewhere in the Python standard library and it would be better to use that. But what is that function?</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html?highlight=throw#generator.throw" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>generator.throw</code></a> for this purpose. The example looks like</p>
<pre><code>except Exception as e:
    d = emergencyStop()
    d.addCallback(lambda: (_ for _ in ()).throw(e)))
</code></pre>
