<p>This should be quite simple but I can't find a simple solution. Frankly this should be a one liner.</p>
<p>In Python 3, how can you convert a list, such as</p>
<pre><code>['hello','world']
</code></pre>
<p>to a string that is formatted exactly the same, like</p>
<pre><code>"['hello','world']"
</code></pre>
<p>I don't wish to split it into two words.</p>
<pre><code>// This is bad.
"hello world"
</code></pre>
<p>I want to keep the traditional list formatting. I initially thought you could just bind the list as a string like (str)list_name but apparently not. Is there not a simple function for this?</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I found thanks to AChampion that it was a simple syntactical error. I was trying to bind a list to a string like this:</p>
<pre><code>//this is bad
(str)list_name
</code></pre>
<p>When I should have been writing it like this</p>
<pre><code>//this is good
str(list_name)
</code></pre>
<p>That gives me exactly what I was looking for. Thanks for the help and sorry I had to bring such a beginner question here. Still getting used to Python.</p>

<p>Both a lists <code>str()</code> and <code>repr()</code> forms are what you are asking for, assuming that the it is a list of simple strings.<br/>
If you have a more complicated structure and wish to transfer (serialize) to string form and back to object form you may want to look into the <code>json</code> module:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import json
&gt;&gt;&gt; json.dumps(['hello','world'])
'["hello", "world"]'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just simply say:</p>
<pre><code>lst = ['hello', 'world']
new_str = str(lst)
print(new_str) # prints out ["hello", "world"]
</code></pre>
<p>Python won't just convert the string to string format unless your explicitly tell it to. Like so:</p>
<pre><code>lst = ['hello', 'world']
str1 = str(''.join(lst))
print(str1)# prints 'helloworld'
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you want a function:</p>
<pre><code>def listToString(lst):
    new_lst = str(lst)
    return new_lst
</code></pre>
<p>Although the function is really more like a wrapper. I'd just convert the list using python bulitin <code>str()</code> straight up, rather then trying to put it in a wrapper function.</p>

<p>Short answer is: You can't do exactly what you're asking.</p>
<p>You cannot take any list that you typed in Python and get a string with the exact same original formatting. Python is pretty lenient with spacing within lists, so you can construct lists as such:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>['hello', 'world']</code></li>
<li><code>['hello','world']</code></li>
<li><code>[ 'hello', 'world' ]</code></li>
<li><code>[      'hello',         'world'       ]</code></li>
</ol>
<p>When Python creates these lists as lists, it doesn't preserve information about how you wrote it. So, there's not a way to get that back.</p>
<p>If you just want a stringified list, you should probably use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dumps" rel="nofollow">json.dumps</a>.</p>
