<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to search for all variations of a string that is completely the same other than a single character. Here is an example of the string:</p>
<p>AccordionPanelTab cond1_left
AccordionPanelTab cond2_left
AccordionPanelTab cond3_left</p>
<p>I would normally just iterate through a for loop however this string is the class I'm trying to use in beautiful soup. My code looks like this</p>
<pre><code>sessionSwell = dryscrape.Session()
sessionSwell.visit(swellURL)
responseSwell = sessionSwell.body()
soupSwell = BeautifulSoup(responseSwell, "lxml")

swellDayData = soupSwell.findAll("div", {"class": "AccordionPanelTab cond1_left"})
</code></pre>
<p>I was thinking there is a command that I could put in the string in the place of the 1 that would tell the computer I do not care what is in this place. I'm sure this is a simple fix but I researched far and wide and couldn't figure it out. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>As per my understanding, you needed a list of all the strings that needs to match your conditions.You can use regular expression for that. </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow">re.findall(pattern, string)</a> returns a list of matching strings.</p>
<p>You can do that by </p>

<span class="comment-copy">You want something like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38824121/regular-expression-for-class-with-whitestaces-using-beautifulsoup/38825064#38825064" title="regular expression for class with whitestaces using beautifulsoup">stackoverflow.com/questions/38824121/â€¦</a>., it may be as simple as <code>class_="AccordionPanelTab"</code> depending on how the html looks which you have not provided so only you can know for sure</span>
