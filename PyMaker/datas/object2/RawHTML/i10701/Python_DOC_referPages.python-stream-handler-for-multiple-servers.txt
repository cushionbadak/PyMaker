<p>There are servers running in multiple locations,I need to stream the application log data from these servers to a <strong>ZMQ</strong>(Zero Message Queue) using <strong>python stream handler</strong>.How do i use the stream handler to get this done? I have already referred the Python Handlers documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.StreamHandler</a></p>

<p>You can post your logs from different servers as <code>json</code> to the ZMQ iteratively. For the ZMQ make a PyZMQ application which will have a message handler, listening to your incoming json from these servers. Then as per requirement the incoming json data can be processed and stored in a file (or wherever you want to store). This file can be read for the incoming logs ( eg: tail -f fileName.txt or fileName.log)</p>
<p>Here is link which will help you setup a PyZMQ application:</p>

<p>For logging specifically you can use these example:</p>
