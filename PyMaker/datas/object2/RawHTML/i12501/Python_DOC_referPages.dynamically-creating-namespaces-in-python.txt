<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to create an object (say <code>foo</code>) with dynamically created attributes. I can do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Foo:
    pass

foo.bar = 42
...
print(foo.bar) # 42
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I create the attribute, I don't know the name of the attribute yet. What I need is something like this:</p>
<pre><code>def createFoo(attributeName):
    foo = ???
    ??? = 42

...

foo = createFoo("bar")
print(foo.bar) # 42
</code></pre>
<p>How can I achieve this?</p>
</div>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#setattr" rel="nofollow">setattr</a>:</p>
<pre><code>class Foo:
    pass

foo = Foo()
setattr(foo, 'bar', 42)
print(foo.bar)  # 42
</code></pre>
<p>Or, as I originally answered before shmee suggested setattr:</p>
<pre><code>foo = Foo()
foo.__dict__['man'] = 3.14
print(foo.man)  # 3.14
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use a dictionary</p>
<p>then create a get function to easily access it</p>
<pre><code>def createFoo(attributeName):
    dict[attributeName] = 42;

def GetVal(attributeName)
   return dict[attributeName];
...

foo = createFoo("bar")
print(foo.GetVal("bar")) # 42
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't quite understand. inside the function, <code>foo = ???</code> is creating the instance? (e.g. <code>foo = Foo()</code>). And the value (42), where does that come from? How come it is not also passed as an argument to <code>createFoo</code> ? Isn't this question a duplicate of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/285061/how-do-you-programmatically-set-an-attribute-in-python" title="how do you programmatically set an attribute in python">stackoverflow.com/questions/285061/â€¦</a> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could do <code>setattr(foo, "bar", 42)</code> instead of manually altering the instance's <code>__dict__</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, setting the <code>__dict__</code> doesn't work (at least not in Pyhton 3). <code>setattr</code> works fine though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am using Python 3 and <code>__dict__</code> works. What problem are you seeing? Even though it works, it really shouldn't be the preferred way to get this done anyway.</span>
