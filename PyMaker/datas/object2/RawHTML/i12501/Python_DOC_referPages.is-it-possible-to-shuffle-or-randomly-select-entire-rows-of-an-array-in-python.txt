<p>I'm working with a multidimensional array where each column contains ordered data and each row is a different sample.  I would like to randomly downsample to a specific number of rows, but I don't know how to randomly select an entire row or how to randomly shuffle only the orders of the rows of the array.</p>

<p>If you are using numpy, this task is simple:</p>
<pre><code>import random

selected = matrix[random.sample(range(len(matrix), 12), :]

<span class="comment-copy"><code>import random; help(random)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Whenever you have a question in python, I would recommend first checking the documentation in python.org, or at least googling a few keywords. It's a well documented language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please explain what you mean with <code>array</code>. Do you really mean an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">array from the standard library</a> or are you using a <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">numpy.array</a> or are you just using the wrong word to refer to a <code>list</code>?</span>
