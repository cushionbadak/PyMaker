<p>When I running the program I get this error: </p>
<pre><code>UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 85: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Thank you so much and yes I have python 3. With the change as you sad to import the codecs, I now get another error insteed. </p>
<p><code>ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence</code></p>
<p>What sholud I do? any suggestions? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You’re reading your file as though it were encoded in ASCII, but it’s
not. Given the <code>0xc3</code> I would say it’s probably encoded in UTF-8.</p>
<p>So, you need to open it with UTF-8 encoding:</p>
<pre><code>import codecs

fil = codecs.open(txt, "r", "utf-8")
</code></pre>
<p>This all assumes you’re using Python 3, in which strings are Unicode by
default. Since you had no problem with non-ASCII identifiers, that seems
like a safe assumption.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As far as i know, you have to type English letters in order python be able to read it. so you need to change these variables:</p>
<pre><code>bästnamn
bästkast
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> <code>max()</code> is to give a maximum of a list and in string case it will break it to letters and give you back the maximum letter in alphabet, like so:   </p>
<pre><code>myNumList = [1,2,4,5,8,50,10]`
print max(myNumList ) #result 50

myString = 'tree'
print max(myList) #result 't' 

myMixList = [1,2,4,'Apple','20']`
print max(myMixList) #result 'Apple' 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong> it wont work on single <code>integer</code> you will get error, but you do have pass list to it.</p>
<p>your code is fine, just the document you are feeding to, might has some mistakes init, I see your application expect at least 4 column but never use the 4th column which the file type of it doesn't really matter, but i believe your document should be like so:</p>
<pre><code>[String/number] [Number] [Number]
</code></pre>
<p>example of your document should be like so:</p>
<pre><code>String1 158 212
String2 584 795
1234567 845 356
String4 356 489
String5 876 215
String6 985 853
String7 111 809
String8 234 058 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you have string in second or third column that could cause the error, string can't convert to <code>float</code> as well as <code>random.normalvariate</code> wont take string.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I get a <code>SyntaxError</code> at line 7 (<code>bästnamn</code>), because of: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers</a>. How come you didn't encounter it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CristFati because this is presumably Python 3, where Unicode letter characters are accepted as identifiers: see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow, thank you, I was looking at <i>Python2</i> (that's the first that popped up), I didn't imagine that they would extend the identifier charset in 3.x.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">About <code>max</code>, well, that’s a different question, so you should really go through the whole process of first trying hard to fix it yourself, and only then posting a question. But briefly, it means that somewhere you’re passing <code>max()</code> a sequence that’s empty. I recommend using some <code>print</code> calls to see what’s going on.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Stop removing your question, this is not how Stack Overflow works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's Python 3, so you can use the built-in <code>open(txt, encoding='utf8')</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, didn't know about that one, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python 3 allows non-ASCII identifiers.</span>
