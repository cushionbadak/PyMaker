<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For example if I entered Harry Potter into the following code</p>
<p>What should I write in the blank spaces so that First_letter will be assigned with H, Second_letter with a, etc.</p>
<p>If possible, please also explain how the code works.</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<pre><code>Name = input("Enter your name")

First_letter = ____
Second_letter = ____
Third_letter = ____
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The easiest solution for beginners to understand in my opinion is using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#list" rel="nofollow"><code>list()</code></a> like:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; name = list(input("Enter your name"))
&gt;&gt;&gt; name
['n', 'a', 'm', 'e']
&gt;&gt;&gt; First_letter = name[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Second_letter = name[1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Third_letter = name[2]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use index for <code>str</code> objects:</p>
<pre><code>Name = input("Enter your name")

First_letter = Name[0]
Second_letter = Name[1]
Third_letter = Name[2]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you try doing this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have code to display <i>any</i> letters from input? You should probably start from there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your question shows that you lack the most basic understanding of Python language. Stack Overflow is not a best place for such questions. I urge you to start reading the official <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a> which also has a section about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">strings</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you don't need to convert <code>str</code> to <code>list</code>. You could do the same with <code>str</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know, but I figured he wanted to actually have characters, and also I believe it's better practice to show him  this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's not better practice. The call to <code>list</code> makes it overly complicated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't disagree that just using the index is less complicated, But I do think that in the future, should he switch to Java/C# or basically any other language, performing such manipulations on Strings might not be possible and could cause harm. This answer is my opinion of how I would do it. It is obviously not the only answer, though it is correct nonetheless.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unless you specifically require a list, there's no need to convert string to it, because you can use indices, slices and <code>for</code> loop over strings the same way as if it were a list. Basically, treat string as yet another sequence type in Python. And just because some other language lacks such features, it is not an excuse to dismiss them in Python. Whatever language you use, you should do things in the idiomatic way of that particular language.</span>
