<p>Put the following code in <code>displaySmallest.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def displaySmallest(num1, num2):

    number1 = int(input())
    print("enter num 2")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  displaySmallest()

<p>Then type <code>python displaySmallest.py</code> at the command line.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The following program should do as you requested. Notice that it is possible that someone could enter the same number twice in a row. Code was added to take such an occurrence into account.</p>
<pre><code>def main():

    second_number = int(input('Enter the second number: '))
    if first_number &gt; second_number:

        print(second_number, 'is larger than', first_number)
    else:
        print(first_number, 'is the same as', second_number)

    main()

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try doing this</p>
<pre><code>def displaySmallest():
print ("enter num 1")
number1 = int(input())
print("enter num 2")
number2 = int(input())
if (number1&gt;number2):
    print("the first number is larger")
elif (number2&gt;number1):
    print("The second number is larger")

displaySmallest()
</code></pre>
<p>You don't need to use these 2 arguments in this line:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>def displaySmallest(<strong>num1</strong>, <strong>num2</strong>):</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because you are taking the input from within your function and <em>not passing value to it</em>. Although, if you want to keep the arguments, then you can try doing this :</p>
<pre><code>def displaySmallest(num1, num2):
    number1 = num1
    number2 = num2
    if (number1&gt;number2):
        print("the first number is larger")
    elif (number2&gt;number1):
        print("The second number is larger")

print ("enter num 1")
number1 = int(input())

print("enter num 2")
number2 = int(input())

displaySmallest(number1, number2)
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps and have fun coding :) .</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Looks fine to me. Your function isn't using and doesn't need its two arguments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're asking "how do I call this function?", <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Python Tutorial</a> may be useful to you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">minor nitpick but the name of the function could also be refined, as it doesn't actually displaySmallest, but the largest.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's the problem with your code? What is it doing, what is it supposed to do?</span>
