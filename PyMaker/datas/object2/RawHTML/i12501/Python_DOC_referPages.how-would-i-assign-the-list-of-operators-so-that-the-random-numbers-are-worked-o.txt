<p>The code that needs to assign to the list of operators is...</p>
<pre><code>    if ListOfOperator:
    ListOfOperator=['+'] = Number1+Number2
    ListOfOperator=['-'] = Number1-Number2
    ListOfOperator=['*'] = Number1*Number2
</code></pre>
<p>It should work out the answer to each question using the function I'm telling the program that if the operator from the operator list is * to work out Number1*Number2</p>
<p>The current output for telling them if the answer is correct or not prints </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your answer is incorrect, the correct answer is Number1*Number2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when if the question is what is 10*3 it should be printing </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your answer is incorrect, the correct answer is 30.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Now that I have this code...</p>
<pre><code>if Operator == '+':
    realanswer = Number1+Number2
elif Operator == '-':
    realanswer = Number1-Number2
elif Operator == '*':
    realanswer = Number1*Number2

<p>The program always prints that the question is incorrect even with the correct answer inputted, it will then print the correct answer, how would I make it so that It would tell them if it's correct too?</p>
