<p>I'm working on a python school project and I'm having trouble sorting dictionaries. My dictionaries are currently formatted like so: <code>dict = {"Name":[score1,score2,score3]}</code> How can I sort the by: </p>
<ol>
<li>Alphabetically</li>
<li>By highest score</li>
<li>By highest average score</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm fairly new at python so anything to lead me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Edit: Originally for the alphabetical sorting, I got as far as using <code>sorted()</code> but which sorts the keys but does not keep the values.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>1.I am guessing the first sort is based on the Alphabetical order of the keys in dictionary</p>
<p>If you have tried <code>for key,value in sorted(dict.items()):</code> you will get the answer for your first question</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>For this one, you need get the max_score for each student through the lambda function:<code>for key,value in sorted(dict.items(), key = lambda x: max(x[1])):</code></p></li>
<li><p>This one is similar with the second one<code>for key, value in sorted(dict.items(), key = lambda x: sum(x[1])/len(x[1])):</code></p></li>
</ol>
<p>But I think your professor never recommend you ask question in here to help you finish your homework.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you even try?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print(*(sorted(d.items(), key=lambda name,grades:(name, max(grades) if grades else 0, sum(grades)/len(grades) if grades else 0))), sep='\n')</code></span>
