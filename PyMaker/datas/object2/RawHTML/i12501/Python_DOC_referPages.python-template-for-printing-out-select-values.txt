<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So, I know the title seems odd, but so is the question:
I've been taking a break from Javascript to mess around with some python some more, and I was wondering if there was a way to create a "Template" so I don't have to keep typing the wwname, wworigin, and wwidn over and over in the functions
thanks

<p>Looks like you're looking for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow">string formating</a>.</p>
<p>In your code you could define a function and call it inside your <code>print()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def tpl_print(name, origin, idn):
    return "\nname: {0}\norigin: {1}\nidn: {2}".format(name, origin, idn)

print(tpl_print("horse", "Europe", "001"))
</code></pre>
<p>Will print:</p>
<pre><code>name: horse
origin: Europe
idn: 001
</code></pre>
