<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Basically my question is-
Im not sure how to take a list of foods:</p>
<pre><code>foods=['Steak','French Fries','Hamburger','Spinach Pasta','Omelette','beans','Chicken']
</code></pre>
<p>and returns
        veggies - Food objects from foods that are vegetarian (list of Food)</p>
<p>the problem is im not sure if Im supposed to make a new list and add the vegetarian food from the "foods" list to the new one or if the word "objects" has anything to do with this</p>
<p>also how would I be able to go through the list to check to see if it is a veg or not a veg?</p>
<p>this is an assignment that I have to do so I dont want any code answers please but if someone could explain so I could learn for future references that would be amazing </p>
<p>hopefully my question makes sense and that I am allowed to ask this type of question, thanks in advance :)</p>

<p>You need to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=dict#dict" rel="nofollow">dict</a></p>
<p>You can create a dictionary like this:</p>
<pre><code>foods = { "Steak": "not-veg", "Spinach Pasta": "veg" }
</code></pre>
<p>And you can check if Steak is vegetarian food like this:</p>
<pre><code>if foods["Steak"] == "veg":
    print("Vegetarian food")
else:
    print("Not a vegetarian food")
</code></pre>
<p>This is a very naive approach. You can store boolean values in dictionary or define a check function which accepts the food name and return or print the result or you can even build a class which have a is_vegetarian method.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">First of all, what are you trying to do?  Do you have a list of vegetarian foods you can check against?  Or is this some kind of object-oriented exercise where you have to think about classifications of things?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Initially I have to create a list which I did, but then from the list I am supposed to find out what is veg and what is not veg and the main question is how do i do that, I figure you use the append function but idk how to  check if it is veg from the list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use a <code>dictionary</code> instead, then you can put your items in categories within it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">def get_vegetarian(foods):     """     -------------------------------------------------------     Creates a list of vegetarian foods.     Use: v = get_vegetarian(foods)     -------------------------------------------------------     Preconditions:         foods - a list of Food objects (list of Food)     Postconditions:         returns         veggies - Food objects from foods that are vegetarian (list of Food)     -------------------------------------------------------     """  ((((((hopefully you guys can read that properly but thats all the question gives me))))))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Somewhere you need labelled data to know what a "vegetarian" food is.  The suggestion of using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dict</a> would allow for quick look up of classification, but you'd have to know how to classify it.  From your samples, this seems like an object-oriented exercise to think about inheritance.</span>
