<p>I am new to Python and I am trying to understand some code.
In code below there is a syntax error but I really don't know what.</p>

<p>Most of the issues where just the code being improperly formatted (Indentation is used to define the bodies of methods and conditional statements within Python)</p>
<p>Here is the code </p>

<p>As there were a lot of indentation errors, I propose you one of the possible solutions:    </p>
<pre><code>def parse(data):
    print(data)

def get_set(json_url):
    url = json_url
    response = urllib.urlopen(url)
    data = json.loads(response.read())

    print data
    s_code = data["statusCode"]
    print s_code

    if s_code == 200:
        url = json_url
        response = urllib.urlopen(url)
        data = json.loads(response.read())
        parse(data)

        time.sleep(seconds_waiting)
        get_set(json_url)

<p>Indentation is one of the major features / requirements in Python. If the above code was in a class it would need to be indented once again. But as pointed out in the comments, please <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow">read the official tutorial</a> (again).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There's tons of errors in there, what's the question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The question is pointless here; the answer is obvious, <i><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read the official Python tutorial</a></i>.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">user1938193 - The Indentation is how you define the bodies of methods as well as conditional statements (as opposed to other languages that use opening/closing brackets, etc) - your incorrect indentation is why it was broken.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That answer was posted just before mine, I did not see other answer when posting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Upvoted yours as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The function get set should not be indentated?</span>
