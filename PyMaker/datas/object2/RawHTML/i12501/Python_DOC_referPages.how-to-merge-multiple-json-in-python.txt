<p>I have a list which holds multiple json strings like this</p>
<pre><code>a = [{"name": "Alex"},{"Age": 25},{"Address": "16, Mount View"}]
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to merge these into a single array like this</p>
<pre><code>a = [{"name": "Alex","Age": 25,"Address": "16, Mount View"}]
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried using <code>jsonmerge</code> but no luck its working fine when using <code>head' and</code>base` values.</p>
<p>Can some one give me a hand in this.</p>
<p>I have also gone through a similar question in stack but it shows merge for separate json but not json in a list <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/22698556/5039470">How to merge two json</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First, these are python dicts</p>
<pre><code>[{"name": "Alex"},{"Age": 25},{"Address": "16, Mount View"}]
</code></pre>
<p>you may call json.dumps on them and turn them into "json strings".</p>
<p>2nd, you can use the dict update method</p>
<pre><code>a =  [{"name": "Alex"},{"Age": 25},{"Address": "16, Mount View"}]
d = {}
for small_dict in a:
    d.update(small_dict)
print(d) # Yay!
a = [d]
</code></pre>
<p>Be warned! , if you have duplicate keys they will override each other</p>
<p>Also take a look on "ChainMap"</p>

<p>To add to the @yoav glazner's answer and if you are on Python 3.3+, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.ChainMap" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ChainMap</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import ChainMap
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [{"name": "Alex"},{"Age": 25},{"Address": "16, Mount View"}]
&gt;&gt;&gt; dict(ChainMap(*a))
{'name': 'Alex', 'Age': 25, 'Address': '16, Mount View'}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This has nothing to to with JSON, since at this point you simply have a list of Python dictionary objects. There are already many answers on how to merge a list of dicts together, e.g. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3494906/how-do-i-merge-a-list-of-dicts-into-a-single-dict">the answers to this SO question</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there a way not to replace the duplicate keys?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">using the reversed list will give you that - a[::-1] (its just replacing from the end to start :) )</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how do i use the reversed list, should i use it as <code>for small_dict in -a:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TonyRoczz - for small_dict in a[::-1]:</span>
