<p>I am trying to create a script that will, on error, attempt to reconnect again. But even after the receiving server has been started it still will not connect</p>
<pre><code>send_sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
while True:
    try:            #Cant get it to make connection after retrying
        send_sock.connect((ip, port))       #always throws Con Refused when tryed
        break
    except socket.error:
        print "Connection Failed, Retrying.."
        time.sleep(1)
send_sock.send("hi")
</code></pre>
<p>edit: Corrected "try:" typo</p>

<p>Python socket will give you a error that should help with debugging your problem. For your example. </p>
<pre><code>try:            
    send_sock.connect((ip, port))       
except socket.error as error:
    print("Connection Failed **BECAUSE:** {}").format(error)
</code></pre>
<p>Second of all you should almost never use <code>while true: [...]</code> as its just going to cause all sorts of problems. In this case you could put in a counter and loop on that break after X attempts. </p>
<pre><code>While counter &lt; 100:
      try:            
          send_sock.connect((ip, port))       
       except socket.error as error:
           print("Connection Failed **BECAUSE:** {}").format(error)
           print("Attempt {} of 100").format(counter)
           counter += 1

<span class="comment-copy">I'm going to assume that you're using <code>try:</code> instead of <code>Try</code> in your actual code (because <code>Try</code> is not valid syntax)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I corrected the try statement in the post, Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the current output?  Does it raise an error?  Does it get to the <code>send_sock.send</code> line even though the connection failed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">are you sure you are connecting to a valid port and ip, i mean is something listening on that port and ip. I tried your code against an app in my machine and its working as expected.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My ip is localhost and port is 1234. My problem is that if it doesn't connect on first try it won't ever connect. It will keep attempting to connect.</span>
