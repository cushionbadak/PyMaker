<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have this code:</p>
<pre><code>for x in adele_text:
    if "Hello, its me" in x:
        print (x)
</code></pre>
<p>It prints the line where "Hello, its me" is. I would like to be able to print the next line, and the line after this one. How can I print the next x each lines and maybe the x lines before that?</p>
<p>Would there be a way to print the last 2 sentences? Sentences are seperated with a "."</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow"><code>next()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>number_of_lines_to_print = 2

with open(filename) as adele_text:
    for line in adele_text:
        if "Hello, its me" in line:
            # printing next "number_of_lines_to_print" lines
            for _ in range(number_of_lines_to_print):
                print(next(adele_text, ''))
            break  # remove if you want to continue searching the file
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the empty string in <code>next(adele_text, '')</code> is important - it helps to avoid the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration" rel="nofollow"><code>StopIteration</code> exception</a> being raised in case we are at the end of the file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just to note ... this relies on <code>adele_text</code> being a <code>TextIOWrapper</code> (in order for the loop and the <code>next</code> to cooperate`)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@donkopotamus yeah, I don't really like the solution myself and it solves a part of a problem only. Let's see if this would be enough for the OP. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, I tried to run it and it printed out this: TypeError: 'str' object is not an iterator   on the line :print(next(adele_text, ''))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bob interesting, just tested on Python 3.5, working for me. Are you sure you are using the same exact code as in the answer? Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am not since the text from adele_text is a string, not a file! I can post my whole script if you want.</span>
