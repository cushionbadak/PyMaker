<p>I used to have a program in Python 2 (I am now using version 3) where it would be able to find a specific part of the time, e.g. the hour or the minute. Sadly, I lost the Raspberry Pi this was on. I know that it involves the <code>from datetime import datetime</code> command but I don't know how to apply it. There doesn't seem to be anything about this on the web anywhere.</p>
<p>I can't remember exactly how it works but it's probably something like this:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime

hour = datetime.hour()
print("The current hour is " + hour + "!")
</code></pre>
<p>Which would return the following</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;The current hour is 13!
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should first check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow">Python's official documentation</a>, as it has a list of all the features for the Standard Library. A simple Google search for "python 3 datetime hour" would've gotten you what you needed.</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime

hour = datetime.now().hour
print("The current hour is " + hour + "!")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Have a look <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime
now = datetime.now()
</code></pre>
<p>if you then try print(now) you will have the whole datetime stamp...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2016-01-13 20:14:48.836659</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can access them separately with:</p>
<pre><code>now.hour
now.minute
now.second
...
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You might be looking for:</p>
<pre><code>In [29]: hour = datetime.now().hour
In [30]: print('the current hour is {}!'.format(hour))
the current hour is 20!
</code></pre>
<p><code>datetime.now()</code> is the full current date and time, with separate attributes for day, month, hour, etc:</p>
<pre><code>In [31]: datetime.now()
Out[31]: datetime.datetime(2016, 1, 13, 20, 0, 57, 648969)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3.5/library/datetime.html</a> Ya not sure what question you have</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I looked on that site both earlier and just now, but couldn't find what I was looking for (I didn't really understand a lot of the words, I'm new to coding) but thanks so much for the answer!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem, glad to be of help! I would recommend going through the earlier chapters in the official Python 3 documentation as it's written in the same format but is much easier to read (since it explains the basic data types and operations), and it'll let you learn the right vocabulary. Here's a link to it: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html</a> Additionally, you might also want to check out one of the tutorials linked in the official beginners' guide: <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide</a></span>
