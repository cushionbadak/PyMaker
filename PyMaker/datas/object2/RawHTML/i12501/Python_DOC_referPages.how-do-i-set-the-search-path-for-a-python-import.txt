<p>I'm using Windows 10 with VS2015 and Python 3.4. I have created a module called <code>this.py</code>. Now I want to <code>import this.py</code>. That works OK if <code>this.py</code> is in the current folder. But I need <code>this.py</code> to be in a different folder which is used by all of my scripts.</p>
<p>I have tried a few approaches but none would find this.py. One approach was to set my Windows CMD PATH.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me how to set the search path for imports?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append("path-here") 
</code></pre>
<p>Then that directory will be searched when you import something (other than standard directories) </p>
<p>Edit: the path of the directory containing the imported file, not of the file</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You should name your file something else, as <code>this</code> is already in the std lib. Try <code>import this</code> in the Python console, maybe you'll learn something new :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should read the Python documentation. They have a section on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path" rel="nofollow noreferrer">module search path</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My name is not really 'this.py'. It is 'vendr.py' ... 'this' was just a placeholder.</span>
