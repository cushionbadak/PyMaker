<p>I need to replace values in an attribute table for one column (replace zeroes in column named "label" to 100). Is this possible using ogr or python? I have to do this for 500+ shapefiles.</p>

<p>In the Esri ArcGIS realm, <a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/main/10.2/index.html#//018w00000014000000" rel="nofollow">Update Cursors</a> are typically used for this type of operation. </p>
<p>For example</p>
<pre><code>import arcpy

# Your input feature class
fc = r'C:\path\to\your.gdb\feature_class'

# Start an update cursor and change values from 0 to 100 in a field called "your_field"
with arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(fc, "your_field") as cursor:
    for row in cursor:
        if row[0] == 0:
            row[0] = 100
        cursor.updateRow(row)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes you can easily do this in python. What did you try or where are you stuck ? You can start by having a look to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.walk()</code></a> python function (in order to traverse directory structure and get the name of your files) then you could give a try to the <a href="https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>fiona</code></a> python module (it relies on OGR but offers an easier API, especially when you are only working with attributes). Depending on whether in a hurry you are to get the task done, you could also use the <code>threading</code> module in addition.</span>
