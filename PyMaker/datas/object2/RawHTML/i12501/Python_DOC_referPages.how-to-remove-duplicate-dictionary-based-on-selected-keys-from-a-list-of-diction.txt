<p>I am new to Python and trying to learn it as much as possible. I am stuck with a silly problem where I want to remove certain dictionary items of a list based on selective key-value pairs. For ex, I have:</p>
<pre><code>l = [{'A':1, 'B':2, 'C':3, 'D':4},
     {'A':5, 'B':6, 'C':7, 'D':8},
     {'A':1, 'B':9, 'C':3, 'D':10}]
</code></pre>
<p>And the output I want is removal of dictionaries based on two keys <code>A</code> and <code>C</code> values:</p>
<pre><code>l = [{'A':1, 'B':2, 'C':3, 'D':4},
     {'A':5, 'B':6, 'C':7, 'D':8}]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#set" rel="noreferrer"><code>set</code></a> to remember whether the items are seen.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A, B, C, D = 'ABCD'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [
...     {A:1, B:2, C:3, D:4},
...     {A:5, B:6, C:7, D:8},
...     {A:1, B:9, C:3, D:10}
... ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; seen = set()
&gt;&gt;&gt; [x for x in lst if [(x[A], x[C]) not in seen, seen.add((x[A], x[C]))][0]]
[{'A': 1, 'C': 3, 'B': 2, 'D': 4}, {'A': 5, 'C': 7, 'B': 6, 'D': 8}]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like you want to keep the first (A,C) pair seen.  Is that right?  And do you need to preserve the order?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes @DSM I need only those dictionaries in my final list which have unique pair of (A,C) key-values. No, order is not important.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, it's clear that you only want <i>one</i> of the possibly many dictionaries with the same (A,C) pair.  But do you always need to have the <i>first</i> one, or would <code>{'A':1, 'B':9, 'C':3, 'D':10}</code> have worked equally well?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @falsetru for the solution. It worked as charm! :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the purpose of <code>A, B, C, D = 'ABCD'</code>? I want to use this but the keys of my dict are specific strings e.g. <code>slotSentence</code>.</span>
