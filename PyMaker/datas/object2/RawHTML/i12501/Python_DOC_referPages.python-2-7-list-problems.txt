<p>I am in need of some help, I'm currently doing an online python course and i can seem to get the desire result to complete the assignment.</p>
<p>basically, there is a text document which i need to call by using "raw_input" i then use"open()" function and then i have an empty "list()"</p>
<p>Now i run a "for" loop for each line in my .txt doc, i need to "r.strip()" all the white space, which leaves me with a 4 live .txt document ( .txt file will be at the bottom of the ask ) now i have to ".split()" those lines into words. now from the i need to loops through those words and ".append()" each word that isnt already in the list, then ".sort()" then print ... hopefully by that stage it looks as the desired output.</p>
<p>Just to make me feel a little better this is the first time im doing any sort of coding. so if you could explain where and why im going wrong that would be great.
CODE SO FAR - currently produces an error</p>
<pre><code>fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
lst = list()
for line in fh:
    a = line.rstrip()
    b = a.split()
    for words in b:
        if words not in lst:
print lst
</code></pre>
<p>.TXT DOCUMENT</p>
<pre><code>But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief
</code></pre>
<p>p.s - Theres no point in changing the .txt to one line because the code it wont work in the grader. Ive tried (got the desired output, wrong code)</p>
<p>Please, you help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>if there is anymore info you need, ill try provide it.</p>

<p>This will read the file, add words to list, sort the list, and then print it.</p>
<pre><code>fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
lst = list()
for line in fh:
    a = line.rstrip()
    b = a.split()
    for words in b:
        if words not in lst:
            lst.append(words)
lst.sort()
print lst
fh.close()
</code></pre>
<p><code>lst.append(element)</code> will add the <code>element</code> into the list <code>lst</code>.</p>
<p><code>lst.sort()</code> will sort the list <code>lst</code> alphabetically.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>l = list()
with open('inp.txt') as inp:
        for each_line in inp:
                a = each_line.strip()
                l += a.split()

print set(l)
</code></pre>
<p>use with keyword as it's a better practice as it would close your file after operation.and for the unique portion use set() which only accepts unique elements</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could also make use of <code>set</code> which is like a list but without duplicates. This means you don't have to check for duplicates yourself, since <code>set</code> will do it for you auto-magically.</p>
<p>eg:</p>
<pre><code>fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
lst = set()
for line in fh:
    a = line.rstrip()
    b = a.split()
    for words in b:
        lst.add(words)
lst = list(lst)
lst.sort()
print lst
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try list comprehension to generate list, use set to remove duplicate entry</p>
<pre><code>lst = [words for line in open(fname) for words in line.rstrip().split()]
lst = list(set(lst))
lst.sort()
print lst
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">"currently produces an error". Which is, what exactly? Can you add the traceback to your question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"".append()" each word that isnt already in the list". Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>set</code></a> may be a lot more convenient for that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your <code>if</code> statement has no code block. Also, you're not doing anything with <code>lst</code> - it's just an empty list and never changes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">line 17, in &lt;module&gt;     if words not in lst: TypeError: argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tim Pietzcker, I know, but I'm extremely new at pyhon and im not entirely sure where im going wrong and how to fix it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So in other words i was getting the traceback because i wasn't actually doing anything to the list itself?</span>
