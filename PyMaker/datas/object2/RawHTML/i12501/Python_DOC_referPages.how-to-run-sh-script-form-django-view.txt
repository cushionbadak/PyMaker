<p>I'm trying to run some simple bash script (.sh) from Django view.</p>
<p>My views.py:</p>
<pre><code>def start_stop(request):
    subprocess.Popen(['/home/ubuntu/contacts/contacts/scripts/test.sh'], shell=True)
    result = 'Success'
    return HttpResponse(result)
</code></pre>
<p>My bash script test.sh:</p>
<pre><code>echo "testing text"
source /home/ubuntu/contacts/ENV/bin/activate
cd /home/ubuntu/contacts/contacts/scripts/
python final_poster.py
</code></pre>
<p>My main goal is activate the virtualenv and start python script name "final_poster.py". But it doesn't work. I also tried to use subprocess.call without any success result. I am stuck on it, can you help me?</p>

<p>I think if don't see any error on the shell, then the script is running properly. If you want to see python shell's output, then you can add <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">logging</a> to bash script. For example:</p>
<pre><code>echo "testing text"
source /home/ubuntu/contacts/ENV/bin/activate
cd /home/ubuntu/contacts/contacts/scripts/
python final_poster.py &gt;&gt; logfile.log
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why can't you include the script in your project, import it, and call the function?</span>
