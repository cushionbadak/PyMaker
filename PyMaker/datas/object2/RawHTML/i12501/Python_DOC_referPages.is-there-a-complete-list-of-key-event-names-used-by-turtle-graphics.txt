<p>While playing around with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python's Turtle</a> module, I used some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.onkey" rel="nofollow noreferrer">key events</a> as the official documentation states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>turtle.onkey(fun, key)</code></p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fun</code> – a function with no arguments or None</li>
<li><code>key</code> – a string: key (e.g. “a”) or key-symbol (e.g. “space”)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the interesting thing is that when you call <sup>1)</sup> the <code>onkeyrelease()</code> method and pass a not registered string (like an empty one (<code>""</code>), or <code>"+"</code>, etc.) as <code>key</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code>turtle.onkeyrelease(lambda: print("Got key event while listening to none."), "")
</code></pre>
<p>No matter what key is pressed by the user, the program outputs "<code>Got key event ...</code>", which was by the way the problem in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/34860931/4594443">this question</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't find more information about this behavior in the documentation ore elsewhere on the internet. So I wonder if there is a complete list of all supported <em>key-name-strings</em> used to program key events?</p>
<hr/>
<p><sup>1)</sup> The basic setup used in the question:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle
turtle.setup(700,500)
turtleWindow = turtle.Screen()
turtleWindow.onkey(lambda: print("You pressed 'a'"), "a")
turtleWindow.listen()
</code></pre>

<p>I scanned through the <a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.5/Lib/turtle.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>turtle.py</code></a> source and came to the same conclusion as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34932365/is-there-a-complete-list-of-key-event-names-used-by-turtle-graphics#comment57598189_34932365">mgc</a>, that the keys are part of <code>tkinter</code>, not <code>turtle</code>. Not wanting to read through the entire <code>tkinter</code> source, I did some googling and found this <a href="https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/keysyms.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">full list of keysyms</a> in the Tk docs, as well as this <a href="http://infohost.nmt.edu/tcc/help/pubs/tkinter/web/key-names.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">abbreviated list</a> for Latin-1 keyboards (it is missing the individual letters, but they are also valid key identifiers, such as <code>"Q"</code>). I'm not sure if they are case-sensitive or not, so you'll have to do some experimentation.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure that they are listed directly on turle sources (but i might be wrong). I guess what you are looking for rely on the tkinter implementation, so maybe you could look on that side if you still can't find them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mgc - you are right, looking into the tkinter implementation is a good starting point, since turtle uses it. ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much :) I also found the abbreviated list for Latin-1 keyboards -- and they are case-insensitive IMO. But I still wonder why this isn't mentioned in the documentation...</span>
