<p>For example let's say I have a file called myscript.py</p>
<p>This file contains the following code.</p>
<pre><code>foo(var):
   return var
</code></pre>
<p>How would I call the function foo with argument var on command line.</p>
<p>I know that I can go to the directory myscript.py is placed in and type.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; python myscript.py
</code></pre>
<p>Which will run myscript.py. The only problem is myscript.py doesn't automatically call foo when it is run.</p>
<p>I have tried using </p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    foo( )
</code></pre>
<p>Which does not work for me. For some reason when I do that nothing happens. I get no error message and nothing is called.</p>

<p>You don't get any output because you don't generate any. Try calling <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(var):
    print(var)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    foo('Hello, world')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to use the <code>sys</code> module to pass arguments from the command line.
You can do this:</p>
<pre><code>import sys

def foo(var):
  return var

if __name__ == '__main__':
  # arguments check
  if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print "USAGE: %s &lt;value&gt;" % sys.argv[0]
    sys.exit(1)

  # get the agument so as to use it to the function call
  arg = sys.argv[1]

  # call the function using this argument
  val = foo(arg)

  # print the returned value
  print val
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can run your python script by this command:
<code>python myscript.py 3</code>
giving as argument e.g. the number 3</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Return returns it to the caller. What do you expect to happen?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>foo</code> is being called. You're just a) not passing anything to it, and b) It doesn't do anything. You'll want to use argparse or <code>sys</code> to handle input from the cli</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how do you know that "nothing is called". In your example you just discard whatever your function returns.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Solved thank you.</span>
