<p>I've seen this kind of ternary assignment called and I was wondering if it had a specific name:</p>
<pre><code>value1 = None
value2 = 'real value'
myVar = value1 or value2

// at this point the value of myVar is 'real value'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The docs call that a <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-operations-and-or-not" rel="nofollow">boolean operation</a>.  The value of <code>value1 or value2</code> is just a feature of the language.</p>
<p>In C and C-inspired languages there is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F%3a" rel="nofollow">ternary operator</a>.  The effect of this operator is better called a "conditional expression".  Python has a conditional expression, too:</p>
<pre><code>myVar = value1 if value1 else value2
</code></pre>
<p>I prefer using the conditional expression to the boolean operators in this kind of situation.  The effect of <code>myVar = value1 or value2</code> is not obvious to someone who isn't fluent in Python.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't know that this is "ternary" assignment, but rather "defined or" perhaps?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@squiguy, this is truly called a ternary assignment in Python, since that's how it was used before the <code>... if ... else ...</code> <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">conditional expression</a> was added in Python 2.5.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MarkRansom Ah, I am more Perl inclined and user to seeing <code>$var //= $other</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In his case <code>None == False</code> too. As would <code>0</code>, <code>null</code> and <code>void</code> probably be too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>None != False</code> and <code>None != 0</code>, in Python 2.7 at least.  <code>bool(None) == False</code>, thought.  There is no <code>null</code> or <code>void</code> in Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're downvoting this answer, consider adding a better answer or at least a comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's worth noting that the <code>or</code> operator doesn't work the same as it does in C or C++, as it returns one of the two values rather than a boolean result.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Allendar: whether <code>value2</code> is returned by <code>value1 or value2</code> expression depends on "truthiness" of <code>value1</code>: <code>bool(None) == bool(0) == bool(0.0) == bool([]) == bool('') == bool(False) == False == etc</code>.
