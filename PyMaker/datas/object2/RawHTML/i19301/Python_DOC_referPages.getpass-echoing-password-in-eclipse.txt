<p>Hey all just started dabbling in a little Python to help out with a few scripts at work, but I seem to be getting hung up on a little issue.</p>
<p>I am using Eclipse with pydev for my development platform and developing against python 2.7.3. I am just trying to prompt a user for their password, using:</p>
<pre><code>password = getpass.getpass()
</code></pre>
<p>That line works as expected when running in the terminal/command prompt, however when I am running in the Eclipse console, the user's input isn't hidden like it should be. Any ideas how to fix this?</p>

<p>This is documented behaviour - some terminals are not capable of echo-free input, in that case, it should give a warning instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If echo free input is unavailable getpass() falls back to printing a warning message to stream and reading from sys.stdin and issuing a GetPassWarning.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I see no warning printing to the console though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BrentHronik That is interesting. I can't tell you why that would be the case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm, interesting. Do you know of any workarounds for the case when getpass() is unable to hide the input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BrentHronik If a terminal can't do it, it can't do it. Not much one can do about that (besides give a warning, which it is meant to do). My guess is that eclipse is lying and saying it will hide the input, but doesn't as it could be easier for debugging stuff.</span>
