<p>I need to create a program/game in python where the user quickly enters 2 keys such as the z or x keys and this makes their character move forward everytime they press it in the right order. I've done a lot of research and decided that I should use msvcrt.getch() to recieve the input, but whenever I try it, it stores the input as a byte which I cannot use, I am relatively new to programming and could use some help explaining the function.</p>

<p>You need to <em>decode</em> the returned value to a <code>str</code> object:</p>
<pre><code>msvcrt.getch().decode('ASCII')
</code></pre>
<p>would interpret the byte as a ASCII codepoint, for example. You may need to use a different encoding depending on the keyboard layout and locale, but the <code>msvcrt.getch()</code> API specifically only deals with ASCII characters according to the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The module implements both the normal and wide char variants of the console I/O api. The normal API deals only with ASCII characters and is of limited use for internationalized applications. The wide char API should be used where ever possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You probably want to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/msvcrt.html#msvcrt.getwch" rel="nofollow"><code>msvcrt.getwch()</code></a> instead to get Unicode values directly; the method supports more than just ASCII codepoints as well.</p>
