<p>I'm writing a program that allows the user to enter and even number of players and then it will generate a round robin tournament schedule. <code>n/2 * n-1</code> number of games so that each player plays every other player.</p>
<p>Right now I'm having a hard time generating the list of the number of players the user enters. I'm getting this error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: 'int' object not iterable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I get this error a lot in my programs, so I guess I'm not quite understanding this part of Python, so if someone could explain that as well, I'd appreciate it.  </p>
<pre><code>def rounds(players, player_list):
    """determines how many rounds and who plays who in each round"""
    num_games = int((players/2) * (players-1))
    num_rounds = int(players/2)
    player_list = list(players)
    return player_list

<p>If you just want to get a list of numbers, you probably want the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range"><code>range()</code></a> function.</p>
<p>For an actual round-robin tournament, you should look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations"><code>itertools.combinations</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; n = 4
&gt;&gt;&gt; players = range(1,n+1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; players
[1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; list(itertools.combinations(players, 2))
[(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)]
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>player_list= list(players)
</code></pre>
<p>Is what raises the <code>TypeError</code>. This is happening because the <code>list()</code> function only knows how to operate on objects that can be iterated over, and <code>int</code> is not such an object.</p>
<p>From the comments, it seems like you just wanted to create a list with the player numbers (or names, or indices) in it. You can do it like this:</p>
<pre><code># this will create the list [1,2,3,...players]:
player_list = range(1, players+1) 
# or, the list [0,1,...players-1]: 
player_list = range(players) #  this is equivalent to range(0,players)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">How are you calling <code>rounds</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well rounds are how many games can be going on at the same time, so n/2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what do you intend to do with <code>list(players)</code> ??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm trying to get a list so that if there are 4 players, player_list=[1,2,3,4]. i haven't quite figured out what to do after that, but for the round robin algorithm it seems to be useful to have a list of the players</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like you want <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.combinations()</code></a> If you can't work out how to generate a list of numbers, you need to look over some basic Python tutorials first.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That does help me generate the list, but it includes 0.  I now have: player_list= list(range(players))  How do I do this starting with 1? I'm sure it's really easy but I'm new to lists and I'm not sure</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>range(x,y)</code> generates a range of numbers from <code>x</code> to <code>y-1</code> (whereas <code>range(y)</code> generates a range of numbers from <code>0</code> to <code>y-1</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it says that global name itertools is not defined</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tinydancer9454 because you need to <code>import itertools</code>. :)</span>
