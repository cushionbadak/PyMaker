<p>I'm a beginner at Python just getting to grips with classes. I'm sure it's probably something very basic, but why does this code:</p>
<pre><code>class Television():
    def __init__(self):
        print('Welcome your TV.')
        self.volume = 10
        self.channel = 1
    def channel(self, channel):
        self.channel = input('Pick a channel: ')
        print('You are on channel ' + self.channel)
    def volume_up(self, amount):
        self.amount = ('Increase the volume by: ')
        self.volume += self.amount
        print('The volume is now ' + self.volume)
    def volume_down(self, amount):
        self.amount = ('Decrease the volume by: ')
        self.volume -= self.amount
        print('The volume is now ' + self.volume)
myTele = Television()
myTele.channel()
myTele.volume_up()
myTele.volume_down()
</code></pre>
<p>Produce the following error:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: 'int' object is not callable, Line 18
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I changed the code to this:</p>
<pre><code>class Television():
    def __init__(self, volume = 10, channel = 1):
        print('Welcome your TV.')
        self.volume = volume
        self.channel = channel
    def change(self, channel):
        self.channel = input('Pick a channel: ')
        print('You are on channel ' + self.channel)
    def volume_up(self, amount):
        self.amount = int(input('Increase the volume by: '))
        self.volume += self.amount
        print('The volume is now ' + str(self.volume))
    def volume_down(self, amount):
        self.amount = int(input('Decrease the volume by: '))
        self.volume -= self.amount
        print('The volume is now ' + str(self.volume))
myTele = Television()
myTele.change()
myTele.volume_up()
myTele.volume_down()
</code></pre>
<p>But it returns:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: change() missing 1 required positional argument: 'channel'
</code></pre>
<p>Again, this is coming from someone just starting with classes, so please don't be too harsh if I've done something glaringly obvious wrong. Thank you.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You assign a <code>channel</code> attribute in your <code>__init__</code>:</p>
<pre><code>self.channel = 1
</code></pre>
<p>This shadows the <code>channel()</code> method on the class. Rename the attribute or the method. </p>
<p>Attributes on the instance trump those on the class (except for data descriptors; think <code>property</code>s). From the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#class-definitions" rel="nofollow">Class definitions documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Variables defined in the class definition are class attributes; they are shared by instances. Instance attributes can be set in a method with <code>self.name = value</code>. Both class and instance attributes are accessible through the notation “<code>self.name</code>”, and an instance attribute hides a class attribute with the same name when accessed in this way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your methods also expect a parameter that you are not passing in in your example, but I'm figuring you'll solve that yourself next.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have a method called <code>channel</code> and a variable called <code>channel</code>.  The variable, which is an <code>int</code>, shadows the method (steals it's name so that you can't access it).  Rename wither the method or the variable and this will solve your problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Actually your code after the Edit exposed the problem Martijn was already indicating at. Your <code>self.change()</code> expects a parameter which you don't provide in <code>myTele.change()</code>. Since you are not using the parameter in the method, you should define <code>change</code> as:</p>
<pre><code>def change(self):
    self.channel = input('Pick a channel: ')
    print('You are on channel ' + self.channel)
</code></pre>
<p><code>volume_up</code> and <code>volume_down</code> actually assign a string to self.amount instead of calling a function. You probably want to change those to</p>
<pre><code>def volume_up(self, amount):
    self.amount = input('Increase the volume by: ')
    self.volume += self.amount
    print('The volume is now ' + self.volume)
def volume_down(self, amount):
    self.amount = input('Decrease the volume by: ')
    self.volume -= self.amount
    print('The volume is now ' + self.volume)
</code></pre>
<p>Since you are setting <code>self.amount</code> every time before using it, you can probably just make it a local variable to the method ( <code>amount</code> ). If you have future plans to have a method <code>xyz()</code> that uses <code>self.amount</code> without first setting it, you should make sure <code>self.amount</code> is set in <code>__init__()</code> to a reasonable value, in case <code>xyz()</code> is called before the volume changing methods.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Martijn, how good are you? I mean every time I open up a Python question you're first to the punch :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MorganWilde: you are right .. i agree. ..  !! indeed his answers are great source of learning :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MorganWilde: Call me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Luke" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Lucky Luke</a>. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, you cleared up what Martijn was saying about passing parameters in methods.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You were lucky I came in late to this question and noticed your edit, such a late change with additional things to be answered often gets unnoticed.</span>
