<p>Say I have two lists.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; List1 = ['This', 'is', 'a', 'list']
&gt;&gt;&gt; list2 = ['Put', 'this', 'into', 'dictionary']

&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {}
</code></pre>
<p>How would I use a loop to make list1 the keys and list2 the values so that each index would store themselves into the dictionary, so as an example...</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'This': 'Put', 'is': 'this', 'a': 'into', 'list': 'dictionary'}
</code></pre>

<p>Since you explicitly ask "How would I use a loop to X" rather than "How do I X", this may be a homework assignment where they don't want you to solve it the trivial way with <code>zip</code>. So, just in case, I'll give you a hint.</p>
<p>First, here's a way to iterate two lists in lockstep (assuming you know they're the same length). It's not the <em>right</em> way to do it—again, that's <code>zip</code>—but if your professor wants you to do things the wrong way, you can.</p>
<pre><code>length = len(List1)
for i in range(length):
    print(List1[i], List2[i])
</code></pre>
<p>Now you just have to figure out what to do inside that loop instead of <code>print</code>, do get <code>d[x]</code> to equal <code>y</code> for each matching x and y from the two lists.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you know about <code>zip</code>? If so, this is trivial. If not, go read <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>, and then it's trivial.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that this is a <i>bad</i> way to do this in general, as <code>zip()</code> is right there, this has unstable behaviour for lists of different lengths, it's slow, and it only works on lists, not arbitrary iterables.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So how would I exactly use the zip() function with these lists to put them into a dictionary with the indexes being adjacent for each list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Lattyware: The answer already says, pretty explicitly, that this is the wrong way to do it, and the only reason to do it is if your professor wants you to do things the wrong way. Is that not clear enough?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TomManolakis: have you read the linked documentation on <code>zip</code>, or just done <code>print(list(zip(List1, List2)))</code> to see what it does?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert Unfortunately I regularly see people taking things that clearly say 'don't do it this way', and doing it that way. I tend to therefore try and reinforce it whenever I can - it isn't a judgement on your answer, you were answering the question that was <i>asked</i>, and as you say, you mentioned it was bad. I just tried to reinforce that fact by explaining how it is bad.</span>
