<p>I am going to be holding a Python workshop to teach some beginner level programmers at my college Python.</p>
<p>I am looking for a way to modify the default behavior of Python interactive sessions so that expressions do not automatically print out results. For example, take this following interactive session:</p>
<pre><code>wil@calcifer:~$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Aug  1 2012, 05:16:07)
[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 7
&gt;&gt;&gt; x + y
12
&gt;&gt;&gt; first_name = "Test"
&gt;&gt;&gt; last_name = "Person"
&gt;&gt;&gt; first_name + last_name
'TestPerson'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This would enforce the use of the <code>print</code> statement to avoid confusion later on.
This isn't crucial, but I was surprised that I was unable to find any settings for this anywhere.</p>
<p>I would be able to preconfigure the machine beforehand, so any solutions would work. Does anyone know if this is possible, or what change to the interactive sessions creates this effect?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I know you didn't come here for teaching advice, but without an output, what's <code>x + y</code> supposed to do? Why type it at all if you don't want the value to be output or stored anywhere?</p>
<p>Your students will be confused: "what does <code>x + y</code> do?"</p>
<p>If you want to show some expression, just consistently put a <code>print</code> statement in front of it, or assign it to a value.</p>
<p>I've found that people are often confused the other way around, so much that they don't know that <code>return</code> actually gives them the value back, and they always want to use <code>print</code>.  Don't forget that you can define functions interactively, and put the return there.  Then you can show them that the function returns that value, even with no <code>print</code>s.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The expression printing in interactive sessions is mediated via a call to
<code>sys.displayhook</code>. Just override it to a NOP:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.displayhook = lambda x: None

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 2 + 3
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>In a plain Python session it is wired to sys.stdout. Applications that offer a Python shell on a GUI are expcted to use it to print the expression values back to the user.</p>
<p>You can write your pythonrc.py ( ~/.pythonrc.py file) to do this by default, each time the interpreter is called.
Further documentation on sys.displayhook can be found here:

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I don't think you can configure the shell to suppress the results of expressions, but would it work if you just assigned every expression to a variable? It won't print anything then...</p>
<p>E.G.</p>
<pre><code>x=5
y=7
z = x+y
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">No, please do not do that. The interactive shell is a major debugging tool that I'd expect Python programmers know how to use. Do not teach with a neutered REPL!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know you didn't come here for teaching advice, but without an output, what's <code>x + y</code> supposed to do?  Why type it at all if you don't want the value to be output or stored anywhere?  Your students will be confused: "what does <code>x + y</code> do?"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, part of the reason I asked the question was to see what others thought of the idea. You are right, though - there would be something missing without it. If either of you create an answer, I'll mark it as accepted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters: I  never start showing Python with this behavior - But I have had problem in the past to get the students understanding the values are not printed when running a program. I can see doing this (my answer bellow shows how) in an intermediate step to some groups.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1, answers the question nicely, but I think it would confuse python learners.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see the OP's point, and I am considering opting for this in some class sessions myself. It is sometimes harder to make them understand why the result of each line in a program is not itself printed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah it does go both ways.  I suppose confused learners are unavoidable whichever method you choose.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, do this since an empty expression doesn't mean much in a python script anyway.  What would <code>x+y</code> on its own mean otherwise?</span>
