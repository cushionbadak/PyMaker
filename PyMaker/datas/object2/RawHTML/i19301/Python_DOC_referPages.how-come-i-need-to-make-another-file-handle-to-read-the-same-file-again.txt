<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was playing around files with python, so i wrote this:</p>
<pre><code> ifh=open('2.txt','r')  
   for line in ifh:  
     print(line,end="")
 print("Done")
 #ifh=open('2.txt','r')
    for line in ifh:
      print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>The second loop does print the file only if i uncomment the second file handle.<br/>
Why is that?<br/>
Shouldn't it work without the second one?  </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's because after the first loop is finished, <code>ifh</code>'s current position is at the end of the file. At that point, there is no more data to read.</p>
<p>To read the data again, you need to use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#file.seek" rel="nofollow"><code>ifh.seek(0)</code></a> to move back to the beginning of the file.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because you need to <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.seek" rel="nofollow">seek</a> back to the beginning of the file using this:</p>
<pre><code>ifh.seek(0)
</code></pre>
<p>When you <code>open</code> the file again for reading, it resets the file's current position to the beginning.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are at the end of the file when you print <code>Done</code>. you can do a <code>ifh.seek(0)</code> to get to the beginning again.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do: <code>ifh.seek(0)</code> before second loop.</p>
<p>Its because you read all lines from the file and <code>seek</code> method goes to the first byte of file, and you can read it again.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also make a closed loop ahead of the for-loop.</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    for line in ifh:
        print(line,end=" ")
</code></pre>
