<p>I am a rookie at python, having a hard time figuering out how lists and dict really works. In my program i have a list that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>Hat =[334,hat,59,200]
</code></pre>
<p>that i want to make into a dict, with a key <code>334</code> and the vaule = <code>[hat,59,200]</code>. How could i make it so?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Simply extract the first and all further elements with a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/the-python-slice-notation">slice</a>:</p>
<pre><code>{Hat[0]: Hat[1:]}
</code></pre>
<p>If you had multiple hats, you can use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionary comprehension</a>:</p>
<pre><code>hats = [
    [334,'hat',59,200],
    [123,'chapeau',19,300],
    [999,'hut',1,100],
]

print( {Hat[0]: Hat[1:] for Hat in hats} )
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow did not realize that slice was such a powerful tool, but what if i have a list of several objects (lets say the Hat is just 1 object in a list of several objects). If i would use sliceing, would that apply for each line (given that i use a for loop to go through each line)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RickardSturesson Updated the answer with a solution for that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! Would you plz look at my edited version, since it involves a more complicated problem? Think I am getting the hang of it, but not sure</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bardolf Sorry, but when you add multiple additional questions, you make it hard to follow questions and answers, and your question becomes hard to read for others. Instead, just <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask">ask a new question</a>. If necessary, you can link to this one. Thanks!</span>
