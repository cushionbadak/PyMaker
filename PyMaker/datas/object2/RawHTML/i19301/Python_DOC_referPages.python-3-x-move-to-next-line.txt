<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've got a small script that is extracting some text from a .html file.</p>
<pre><code>f = open(local_file,"r")
for line in f:
    searchphrase = '&lt;span class="position'
    if searchphrase in line:
        print("found it\n")
</code></pre>
<p>That works fine for me(error handling will be imported later), my problem is that the text I want to extract follows 2 lines after the searchphrase. How can I move 2 lines down in the .html file ?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can advance <code>f</code> (which is an iterable) by two lines by calling <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next"><code>next()</code></a> on it twice:</p>
<pre><code>with open(local_file,"r") as f
    for line in f:
        searchphrase = '&lt;span class="position'
        if searchphrase in line:
            print("found it\n")
            next(f) # skip 1 line
            return next(f)  # and return the line after that.
</code></pre>
<p><em>However</em>, if you are trying to parse HTML, consider using a HTML parser <em>instead</em>. Use <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">BeautifulSoup</a>, for example.</p>

<p>This works nice for me:</p>
<pre><code>f = open(local_file,"r")
found = -1
for line in f:
    if found == 2:
        print("Line: "+line);
        break
    elif found &gt; 0:
        found += 1
    else:
        searchphrase = '&lt;span class="position'
        if searchphrase in line:
            print("found it")
            found = 1
</code></pre>
<p>The input file was:</p>
<pre><code>bla
&lt;span class="position"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;
blub
that's it
whatever
</code></pre>
<p>And the output of the program:</p>
<pre><code>found it
Line: that's it
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of calling <code>break</code> you may also reset <code>found</code> to -1 to search for more occurences of the pattern...</p>
