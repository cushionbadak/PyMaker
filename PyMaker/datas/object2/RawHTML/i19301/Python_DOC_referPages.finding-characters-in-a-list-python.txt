<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def find_friend(filename, name):
    lists = open(filename, 'Ur')
    name1 = set(lists)
    for row in lists:
        if name in name1:
            print row
        else:
            print 'friend does not exist'
</code></pre>
<p>So my desired outcome is opening a list, searching for a character within that list
and returning the character details. for eg. searching for <code>a</code> in <code>[(a,b,c,d),(e,f,g,h)]</code> would return <code>a,b,c,d</code>. So far it isn't returning anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your biggest issue is that the <code>for row in lists</code> won't actually iterate through anything (you've already done a complete read of the file when you called <code>set</code>). I think if you get rid of that line (and look for <code>name in row</code> you should be doing much better.</p>
<pre><code>def find_friend(filename, name):
    lists = open(filename, 'Ur')
    for row in lists:
        if name in row:
            print row
        else:
            print 'friend does not exist'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This is kind of unclear but why don't you just check <code>if name in row</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">checked that, still throwing out nothing</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you please post what the file looks like?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">csv file - 2 rows 4 columns,  John | america | 1/2/03/ | 2315532, Mary | england | 4/20/03/ | 234232</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To parse a CSV file, use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#examples" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code></a> module</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suggested that as well and apparently it doesn't help him</span>
