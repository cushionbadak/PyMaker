<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are problems with your open, which renders it unreadable.
You need to open it with:</p>
<pre><code>f = open("books.txt", "+r")
</code></pre>
<p>"a" stands for appending, so you won't be able to read books.txt with f.</p>
<p>Second, readlines or readline are not good options for your code as of now. You need to update your write method. Since inside the .txt file, the author, bookname and isbn will be messed together, and you are not able to separate them.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You will want to add linebreaks (or other separation characters) after each <code>f.write(..)</code> otherwise you end up with a long line where you wonâ€™t be able to distinguish between the different values.
