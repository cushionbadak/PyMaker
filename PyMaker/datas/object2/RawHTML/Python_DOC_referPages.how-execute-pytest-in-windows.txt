<p>I installed pip on Windows by downloading <a href="http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-1.0.2.tar.gz#md5=47ec6ff3f6d962696fe08d4c8264ad49">http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-1.0.2.tar.gz#md5=47ec6ff3f6d962696fe08d4c8264ad49</a> and running <code>python setup.py install</code></p>
<p>Installation went fine with no errors.</p>
<p>But when I tried installing selenium package with it, it gives me the following error -</p>
<pre><code>pip install -U selenium
Unknown option: u
Unknown or unsupported command 'install'
</code></pre>
<p>Where I'm making the mistake?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do you happen to have the Perl pip lying around somewhere?</p>
<p>Sounds like the problem described here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mike-perdide/gitbuster/issues/62" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/mike-perdide/gitbuster/issues/62</a></p>
<p>To check, in Windows command prompt execute:</p>
<pre><code>C:\&gt;where pip
</code></pre>
<p>This will potentially output the following:</p>
<pre><code>C:\strawberry\perl\bin\pip
C:\strawberry\perl\bin\pip.bat
</code></pre>
<p>If so, this is your problem. Unistall Strawberry Perl or use the full path to python pip.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This error is because the system is finding pip.bat before it finds pip.exe.</p>
<p>You do NOT need to uninstall Strawberry Perl or type the whole path.</p>
<p>What I do is to simply type pip.exe (same number of keystrokes as apt-get) when I want to use the Python utility.  This method seems to work find for me on Win7 with Python(x,y) 2.7x and Strawberry Perl installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Had the same problem under Ubuntu and did:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get remove pip
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In addition to the very helpful nswer of Johannes:
If you don't want to uninstalll Strawberry, you can re-arrange the order of <code>PATH</code> entrys in your Windows system to ensure your <code>Python\Scripts</code> are found before the strawberry entries. If you don't want to do this manually, you can use tools like the "Rapid Environment Editor". </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also solve this problem without removing Strawberry Perl or type the whole path.Move to this C:\Python2.7\Scripts(your Python directory) directory,then use pip command.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should provide path in <code>environment variable</code> for <code>pip.exe</code> file </p>
<p>while executing <code>install command</code> you should use below command</p>
<pre><code>pip.exe install selenium 
</code></pre>
<p>This will surely work, for me this worked :)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I had this problem as well, and like Johannes said, it's because the perl pip is interfering with your Python pip.</p>
<p>To get around it, you can simply do this as well:  </p>
<p><code>python -m pip install &lt;package_name&gt;</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>For Python 3.X and above:</strong></p>
<p>In the CMD prompt type: </p>
<pre><code>py -m pip install  &lt;package_name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><em>Make sure pip is installed already.</em>
<em>Setup the environment variable for pip pointing to the exe file</em></p>
<p>To upgrade: </p>
<pre><code>py -m pip install --upgrade pip
</code></pre>

<p>Same issue with DwimPerl. Uninstalling Dwim fixed the issue as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install -U selenium</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have the same problem in <strong>windows 10</strong>, finally resolved the problem successfully.</p>
<p>I used the following command
<code>where pip</code></p>
<p>I was showing multiple installations of pip. Once removed other installation it worked fine.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">This is only pip(Python) installed on my system.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure? Can you provide the output if you type just <code>pip</code> on the command line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In Python.org 2.7 the path is <code>c:\Python27\Scripts\pip</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe that <b>uninstall</b> is not really necessary, I have only  to insert Python installation path before Strawberry on my <b>PATH</b> environment variable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Continuing with @ElvioMartinelli 's comment, I created additional system variables <code>_PerlPath</code> <code>_PyPath</code>, <code>_zProgPath</code>, etc with <code>_zProgPath</code> set to e.g. <code>%_PyPath%;%_PerlPath%;%_AspPath%;%_SQLPath%</code> and <code>Path</code> set to <code>%_WinPath%;%_JavaPath%;%_zProPath%</code>. Windows seems to expand environment variables in alphabetical order, which is what's up with the <code>_</code>s and <code>_z</code> to force evaluation of the first and second layers of variables before <code>Path</code>, which is now on the 3rd layer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks it works !!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the non-windows answer. Worked for me too, on Ubuntu.</span>
