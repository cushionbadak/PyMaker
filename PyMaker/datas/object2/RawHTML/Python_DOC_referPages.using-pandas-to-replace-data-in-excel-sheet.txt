<p>I tried to come up with a way to copy data from a sheet in an excel file as</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

origionalFile = pd.ExcelFile('AnnualReport-V5.0.xlsx')
Transfers = pd.read_excel(origionalFile, 'Sheet1')
</code></pre>
<p>I have another excel file, which named 'AnnualReport-V6.0.xlsx', it has existing data in the sheet named 'Transfers', I tried to use the dataframe I created easily on to replace data in the sheet 'Transfers' in 'AnnualReport-V6.0.xlsx' from column B, leave column A as it is.</p>
<p>I did a few searches, the closest to what I want is this 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48252485/modifying-an-excel-sheet-in-a-excel-book-with-pandas">Modifying an excel sheet in a excel book with pandas</a></p>
<p>but it does not allow me the keep column A in the original sheet (column A has some equations I do want to keep them), any idea how to do it? Thanks</p>

<p>Would reading column A and inserting it to the fresh data you want to write solve your problem?</p>
