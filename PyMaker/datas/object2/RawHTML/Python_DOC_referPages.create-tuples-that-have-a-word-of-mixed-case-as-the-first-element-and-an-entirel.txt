<p>Create tuples that have a word of mixed case as the first element and an entirely lowercase string as the second element. Take a list of space separated words for your input.</p>
<p>this is what i have so far:</p>
<pre><code>result = {}
words = ("VaneSSa likES tO RuN")
words1 = words.split()
for dic in words1:
    result[dic] = dic.lower()
print(result)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:
{'VanEssa': 'vanessa', 'likeS': 'likes', 'tO': 'to', 'Run': 'run'}</p>
<p>I realize this is a dictionary, and the exercise is to have it be a tuple. Here was the example they used:</p>
<p>"For example, if you are given the string:</p>
<p>RADIO aStRoNoMy Pulsar</p>
<p>you need to obtain the following tuple of tuples using a tuple comprehension:</p>
<p>(('RADIO', 'radio'), ('aStRoNoMy', 'astronomy'), ('Pulsar', 'pulsar'))"</p>
<p>I also referenced <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47042431/lowercase-first-element-of-tuple-in-list-of-tuples">Lowercase first element of tuple in list of tuples</a></p>
<p>but am having a difficult time understanding how to change this from a dictionary to tupple</p>

<p>Dictionaries have a function to get all items as tuples. Use: <code>tuple(result.items())</code></p>
<p>The result of the <code>items</code> function is a list of tuples. To have a tuple of tuples instead, I use the <code>tuple</code> function for conversion.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why are you even using a dictionary if you donâ€™t need one?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I originally thought it was a dictionary. I can start from scratch too, I was hoping there would be an easy way to re structure it as a tuple vs dictionary. I'm learning there is no "easy" way unless i want to skip on learning the concept</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You made building the tuple overly complicated. Just <code>result.append((dic, dic.lower()))</code></span>
