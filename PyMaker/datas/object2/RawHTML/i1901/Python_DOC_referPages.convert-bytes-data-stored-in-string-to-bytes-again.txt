<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i have a string storing data of bytes, an example would be instead have b'Hi\x81y' i have an string with 'Hi\x81y'.</p>
<p>So, with the string, how is in utf-8 i can't read the real data..., and i can't found a way to transform the string expression back to the bytes form.</p>
<p>In some way i'm trying to do this:</p>
<pre><code>data_str = 'Hi\x81y'
eval("b'{}'".format(data_str))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1
SyntaxError: bytes can only contain ASCII literal characters.
</code></pre>
<p>Saldy this example don't works and send an error, even worls if we write manually the code .</p>
<p>Any function i test to decode/encode/transform this fails, because python detect the string as utf-8 while is in bytes.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Not sure exactly what you mean, but you could try any 8 bit encoding.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Hi\x81y'.encode('latin_1')
b'Hi\x81y'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To convert bytes into a string, use the <code>decode</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>mystring = mybytes.decode('utf-8')
</code></pre>
<p>To convert back the string to bytes, use the <code>encode</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>mybytes = mystring.encode('utf-8')

<span class="comment-copy"><code>eval()</code> is used in less than &lt;1% of the worlds code <i>(for a reason)</i>. If you ever think you need it, what you might want is actually <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ast.literal_eval</a> which is half as harmful but does what you probably think <code>eval()</code> will solve.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, i update the post with the error, ast.literal_eval send the same error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Include an example of how you set the value of <code>data_str</code>; as it is, it's not clear if you have a 4-byte string or a 7-byte string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, the example of data_str is in the post..., i'll write in the code only in case...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice!, that its. Thx.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">raw_unicode_escape and latin_1 seems to work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, this is not what i'm asking, the problem is when we have sores the data of the bytes in a str, and back from there to bytes.</span>
