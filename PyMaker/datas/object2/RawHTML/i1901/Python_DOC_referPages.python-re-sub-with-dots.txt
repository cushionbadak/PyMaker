<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would like to put a space before and after a dot in text but only if its not a part of a date.
So far I have this, and i figured out I have to do something with \D. but it gives back the letter before the dot not only the dot:</p>
<pre><code>string = re.sub("\.", " . ", string)
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Input text: 1992.01.04 is my birthday.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Required output: 1992.01.04 is my birthday .</strong></p>
<p>there is a space before the end of string dot.</p>
<p>Other question is the same with colon and time,</p>
<p><strong>Input text: The time is 11:48, reported by: Tom.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Required output: The time is 11:48, reported by : Tom.</strong></p>
<p>there is a space after text 'reported by' before the colon</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>You can use this regex which does a negative look ahead and negative look behind to check if dot/colon is surrounded by digits and replace it with ' \1 '</p>
<pre><code>(?&lt;!\d\d)([.:])(?!\d+)
</code></pre>
<p>Demo, <a href="https://regex101.com/r/hr6slz/4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://regex101.com/r/hr6slz/4</a></p>
<p>This regex works for both colon and dot and as you can replace it by ' \1 '</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need _ positive lookbehind assertion._ (or negative, with <code>\d</code>). Look into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html</a> for details.</p>
<pre><code>re.sub("(?&lt;=\D)\.(\D?)", " . ", '1992.01.04 is my birthday.')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I have updated my answer and with provided same regex you can apply it for dot as well as colon. Hope that helps.</span>
