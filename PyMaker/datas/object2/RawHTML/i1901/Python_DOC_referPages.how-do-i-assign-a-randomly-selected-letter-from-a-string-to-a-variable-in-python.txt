<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First, I would like to say I am new to coding and python in general. I just learned about importing and the random function.</p>
<p>Anyways, I am trying to create a text game, in python, where a letter is chosen randomly from some string/word and the user has to try and guess which letter was chosen. I think I understand how to do for loops well enough so that it continues until the correct letter is chosen, but I have no idea how to even go about randomly choosing the letter. </p>
<p>I would just like some help getting started. Thank you. </p>

<p>Since strings are sequences in Python, you can use <code>random.choice</code> to pick a random element from a list - in your case, a random letter in a string.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = random.choice("abcdefgh")
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
'g'
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = random.choice("abcdefgh")
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
'a'
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>'s are from the REPL console (running Python by itself) and shouldn't be included if you include the code in a python file.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#functions-for-sequences" rel="nofollow noreferrer">library</a> for randomizing things. Simply use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>import random
text = "Some text"
your_variable = random.choice(text)
</code></pre>
<p>and you get your random letter from a sequence in that case which is saved in <code>your_variable</code>.</p>

<p>Since you are relatively new to programming, I'd like to give you an informative example of the game to clarify some concepts.</p>
<ol>
<li>String <code>str</code> is implemented as sequence in Python (you can think that a string is an array of chars). So it supports indexing <code>s = 'abc'; print(s[1]);</code> shows <code>b</code>.</li>
<li>The standard library <code>random</code> includes a bench of functions to carry out randomized operations. As mentioned in the other answers that the function <code>random.choice</code> randomly pick an element from a sequence. So it can be used to randomly pick a character from a string.</li>
<li>You mentioned loops and you seem to be able to master them. So I hereby use another approach called <strong>recursion</strong> to continue the game until the desired answer is found.</li>
<li>The game is written in an <strong>Object-Oriented</strong> manner. If you gonna be a developer latter in your career, it's good practice to see this.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the Code:</p>
<pre><code>import random

class Game:

    def __init__(self, string):
        self.string = string

    def start_game(self):
        self.answer = random.choice(string)
        self.ask_player()

    def ask_player(self):
        char = input("Just enter your guess: ")
        self.cheat(char)

        if char == self.answer:
            print("Bingo!")
            return None
        else:
            print("You missed, try again! (Or press Ctrl+C to goddamn exit!)")
            self.ask_player()

    def show_answer(self):
        print('The answer iiiis: %s \n' % self.answer)

    def cheat(self, user_input):
        if user_input == 'GG':
            self.show_answer()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    string = "This is the string from which the letters are ramdomly chosen!"
    gg = Game(string)
    gg.start_game() 
</code></pre>
<p>Some test runs:</p>
<pre><code>Just enter your guess: 2
You missed, try again! (Or press Ctrl+C to goddamn exit!)

Just enter your guess: T
You missed, try again! (Or press Ctrl+C to goddamn exit!)

Just enter your guess: GG (Haha, I left a cheat code in order to get the right anwser!)
The answer iiiis: o 

You missed, try again! (Or press Ctrl+C to goddamn exit!)

Just enter your guess: o
Bingo!
