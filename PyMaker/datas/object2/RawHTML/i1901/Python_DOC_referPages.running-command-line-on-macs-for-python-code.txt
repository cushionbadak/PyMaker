<p>How do you run the command line in order to read and write a csv file in python on a MacBook?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would suggest using pandas:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('file_name.csv')
df.to_csv('file_name.csv')
</code></pre>

<p>You can find everything about reading and writing with csv files in Python here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CSV File Reading and Writing - Python 3 Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>First, we need to import CSV: </p>
<pre><code>import csv
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, if you want to read a CSV file, first open one up. In the Python Shell (the command line for Python), opening a file in order to read it and storing it in the variable <code>file</code> would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>with open("filename.csv", newline = '') as file:
     #actions with the file
</code></pre>
<p>After that, we need to treat the file. Reading the rows from a csv file works as follows:</p>
<pre><code>with open("filename.csv", "r") as file:
     csv_content = csv.reader(file)
</code></pre>
<p>now we want to print the every row of the csv file. We just add the following code:</p>
<pre><code>     for row in csv_content:
          print(', '.join(row))
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to write to a file, it is a bit different:</p>
<pre><code>with open('filename.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:                     #1
      writer = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter=' ',                       #2
                             quotechar='|', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL) 
      writer.writerow(["Row 1", "Row 2", "Row 3"])                      #3
</code></pre>
<p>First, we open the file (1) and specify that we want it to write to it (by adding the parameter <code>'w'</code>). Then, we define a writer (2) that we will use to write to the CSV file. At last, we use the writer (3) and add a row to our file with the <code>writerow</code> method. Notice that we used a list (<code>["Row 1", "Row 2", "Row 3"]</code>). Each element of that list will be converted to a row into the CSV file. Knowing that the list hast 3 elements, we will add 3 rows into the CSV file with the contents <code>"Row 1"</code>, <code>"Row 2"</code> and <code>"Row 3"</code>. </p>
<p>I hope this answers you question as fully as possible. The code I suggested is writeable into the Python Shell, without executing a separate file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your answer. Do you know how to download the panda library in Brackets (IDE)? I have searched and was not successful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">use pip: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pandas/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pypi.org/project/pandas</a> <code>pip install pandas</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your response! I am more concerned with passing arguments into my function that my .py file has created based off of reading a csv file. Specifically, after I drag my directory into the terminal how do I test to see if certain arguments passed into the function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My apologies, but I don't completely understand your question. Could you describe to me the action of dragging your directory into the terminal? What do you mean by "certain arguments passing into a function"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure thing! You take a folder in finder and drag it and paste it into the terminal. It turns into a file path. Then you click enter. Now youâ€™re in the directory where your .py file is and your csv files are. I am having trouble with next step which is testing my .py file to see if it locates any rows or columns with the word neighborhood in them. I need to know what should I put in the terminal in order to see if the test succeeded. I was able to test my code successfully on windows. Just having trouble with mac.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want to execute your .py file via the terminal? In this case simpy use the <code>python</code> command followed by the name of the file (extension <b>included</b>) and it should execute your python file on the terminal. You may need to specify the python version, if for example you want to use python 3 and it is not the default version. In this case, just type in <code>python3</code> or, if you want to be more specific, for example <code>python3.6</code> instead of <code>python</code>. If your file is called "myfile.py", you would type in <code>python myfile.py</code> or <code>python3 myfile.py</code> or perhaps <code>python3.6 myfile.py</code>.</span>
