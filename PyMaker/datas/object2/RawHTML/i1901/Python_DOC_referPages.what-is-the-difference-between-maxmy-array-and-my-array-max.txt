<p>For example, if I define my array as <code>my_array = np.array([1,2,3])</code>,</p>
<p>What is the difference between 
<code>max(my_array)</code>and 
<code>my_array.max()</code> ? </p>
<p>Is this one of those cases where one is 'syntactic sugar' for the other? Also, why does the first one work with a Python list, but the second doesn't?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As people have stated in the comments of your question, they are referencing two different functions.</p>
<p><code>max(my_array)</code> is a built in Python function available to any sequence data in python.</p>
<p>Whereas, <code>my_array.max()</code> is referencing a function within the object. In this case my_array is from the Numpy array class. Numpy does not recognize the list data type for this function. However, this method will provide a speed improvement over the <code>max(my_array)</code> whenever you are using numpy data sequences. </p>
<p>As a rule of thumb if the variable has a <code>variable.someMethod()</code> the function is a method and is specific to the class of object. If the function is called as <code>function(variable)</code> then the function is either a part of the python distribution or the file/class you are working with.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>[1,2,3].max()</code> gives an error that explains why it doesn't work.  <code>max</code> method is not defined for lists.  An <code>AttributeError</code> like this is basic Python, so you need to learn its significance well.</span>
