<p>Is there any way to get http status in non-numeric way. Like if I use http module   I get http.HTTPStatus.ok which is numeric form of 200. However, I would like to get it as http.HTTPStatus.ok only in alphbetic way for comparision.</p>
<p>I am using a python code which executes an url and get the result back and result.response_code is http.HTTPStatus.ok.</p>

<p>Based on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import http
&gt;&gt;&gt; http.HTTPStatus.OK.phrase
'OK'
</code></pre>
<p>Based on what you've written you should therefore be able to do something like <code>result.response_code.phrase</code>. If instead you get a <strong>number</strong> back you can reverse the lookup like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; http.HTTPStatus(200).phrase
'OK'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Probably not - the status code is a code returned by the web server - anything more then that would require additional parsing, which you may as well do yourself.</span>
