<p>I am trying to build a winzip file cracker without a dictionary attack (For an essay on password security). It needs to scroll through the "combos" iteration trying each combination until the passwords is found. So close to being done but currently it needs the password entry as a single string which is required to be converted to bytes whereas I need it to try each output of the combostotal</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any help</p>
<p>I have saved it in a sandbox <a href="https://onlinegdb.com/ryRYih2im" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://onlinegdb.com/ryRYih2im</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">it would be better if you could extract your problem into something you could post here, most people wont follow an external link (except maybe to a sandbox where you can run the code)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can't you use a for loop and try each of them?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you guys for the quick response. I have uploaded it to a sandbox at the link below <a href="https://onlinegdb.com/ryRYih2im" rel="nofollow noreferrer">onlinegdb.com/ryRYih2im</a> .   I get the idea of just looping it but just cant seen to get it to work</span>
