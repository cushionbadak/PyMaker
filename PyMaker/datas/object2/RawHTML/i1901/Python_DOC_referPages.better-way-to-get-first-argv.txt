<p>I need fast and good way (or library) to use first argument after I do <code>python3.6 test.py some_argument</code>.</p>
<pre><code>if len(sys.argv) &gt; 1:
    argument_i_want = sys.argv[1]
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to do something like:
<code>argument_i_want = some_lib.get_first_or_empty()</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One approach is to use <code>try-catch</code></p>
<p><strong>Ex:</strong></p>
<pre><code>import sys

try:
    argument_i_want = sys.argv[1]
except IndexError:
    argument_i_want = ""
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I would be very surprised if someone wrote a library to reduce 2 lines of code to 1...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can go for a library when you have a bigger functionality. But when the functionality is as small as a if condition, I suggest to go ahead with this itself!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ternary operator: <code>argument_i_want = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) else ''</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If there is some chance that you may be adding other options later, consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">argparse</a> instead, setting defaults for positional arguments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Marking as duplicate because <code>sys.argv</code> is just a <code>list</code>. There is no canonical solution. I find it odd that this doesn't exist too (we have <code>dict.get(key, default)</code> after all) but that's the way it is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good but still this is even longer, I wonder if there is one liner...</span>
