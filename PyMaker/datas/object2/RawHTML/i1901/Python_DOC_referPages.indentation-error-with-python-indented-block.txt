<p>The correct indentation should be:</p>
<pre><code>for link in soup.find_all('a'):
    print(link)
</code></pre>
<p>Try this snippet to understand the need for indentation</p>
<pre><code>for x in range(3):
    print("Inside the loop", x)

print("Outside the loop, this print is run only once")

<blockquote>
<p>The <em>body</em> of the loop is <em>indented</em>: indentation is Pythonâ€™s way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">May I know why is there "IndentationError: expected an indented block"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because you did not indent your print. Python uses indentation to determine which instructions are in your loop and which are outside</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry Antwane, I don't get what you mean. Do you have any links or examples for me to understand it better?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've edited my answer to link to the correct text in python docs</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I get it now, but when I retry it shows "SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print(link)?"</span>
