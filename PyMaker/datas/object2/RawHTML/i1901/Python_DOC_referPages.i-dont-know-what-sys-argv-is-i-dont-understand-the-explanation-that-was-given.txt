<p>they said it is something like 'executes a command passed on the command line'
but I don't understand, what does it mean by pass on the command line?
can program pass something?</p>
<p>please explain to me what does sys.argv do, and why we need it.
and what sys.argv[1]. does this show directory? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Lets say you open a command-line window. In the current directory you have a Python script named <code>foo.py</code> looking like this</p>
<pre><code>import sys

for argument_index in range(len(sys.argv)):
    print("sys.argv[%d] = %s" % (argument_index, sys.argv[argument_index]))
</code></pre>
<p>If you run the script like</p>
<pre><code>&gt; python foo.py a b c d
</code></pre>
<p>Then the <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> are <em>arguments</em> to the script. They will be placed in the <em>list</em> <code>sys.argv</code>. The output of the script will be</p>
<pre>
sys.argv[0] = foo.py
sys.argv[1] = a
sys.argv[2] = b
sys.argv[3] = c
sys.argv[4] = d
</pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Who are "they"? Have you tried reading the excellent <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python documentation</a>? It seems you might need to take some time to go through the tutorial.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have read that, but I don't understand what ' list of command line arguments passed to a Python script' means. I don't understand how arguments 'pass'.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do you execute your python programs?  What arguments do you give it?  Those are the arguments that are passed to the script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I got it. thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so sys.argv is used to change the output from cmd? without changing the code  foo.py?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ONLYIFYOUCANREAD No no no. The Python script I show <i>print</i> the <i>contents</i> of <code>sys.argv</code>. It's a way to pass data from the command-line environment when you run the script. Have you <i>ever</i> run any program from the command-line? Any at all? Did you run them <i>with arguments</i> (the "words" you use after the actual command)? For example <code>copy from_some_file.txt to_some_other_file.txt</code>? Those <code>from_some_file.txt</code> and <code>to_some_file.txt</code> are what will be <i>passed</i> ("put in") the argument list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ONLYIFYOUCANREAD If you really don't know anything about "arguments" or the command-line, then stop with Python at once, and go read a basic computer and command-line tutorial.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh. so sys.argv passed argument from cmd?</span>
