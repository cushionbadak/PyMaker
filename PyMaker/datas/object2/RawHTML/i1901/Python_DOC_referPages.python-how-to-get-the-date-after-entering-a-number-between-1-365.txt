<p>How would you write a Python program that prompts a user for a year, a day of the year (an integer between 1 and either 365 or 366 to account for leap year), and gives the month, day and year?</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.timedelta</code></a> to add a number of days to a starting date. Use <code>datetime.datetime</code> to create the starting date with January 1st of the year.</p>
