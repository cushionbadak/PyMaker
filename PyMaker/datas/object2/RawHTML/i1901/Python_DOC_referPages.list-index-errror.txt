<p>I have created a program which reads a file line into a list. When i run the code below, i see that there is a list with elements inside it.</p>
<pre><code>dogs_list_player = []
dogs_list_computer = []

with open("dogs.txt") as f:
    for i in range(Y):
        dogs_list_player.append(f.readline().splitlines())
        print(dogs_list_player)
    for i in range(Z):
        dogs_list_computer.append(f.readline().splitlines())
        print(dogs_list_computer)
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<pre><code>[['Tim']]
[['Tim'], ['Bob']]
[['Tim'], ['Bob'], ['Jess']]
[['Tim'], ['Bob'], ['Jess'], ['Bess']]
[['Tim'], ['Bob'], ['Jess'], ['Bess'], ['Tess']]
[['Dom']]
[['Dom'], ['Tom']]
[['Dom'], ['Tom'], ['Will']]
[['Dom'], ['Tom'], ['Will'], ['Ben']]
[['Dom'], ['Tom'], ['Will'], ['Ben'], ['Joe']]
</code></pre>
<p>But the issue arises when i add this part of code:</p>
<pre><code>dogs_list_player = []
dogs_list_computer = []

with open("dogs.txt") as f:
    for i in range(Y):
        dogs_list_player.append(f.readline().splitlines())
        print(dogs_list_player)
    for i in range(Z):
        dogs_list_computer.append(f.readline().splitlines())
        print(dogs_list_computer)

class Dog_card: 
    name  = ""
    friendliness = ""
    intelligence = ""
    exercise = ""
    drool = ""

    def printing_card(self):
        prnt_str = "Name:%s \nIntelligence:%s \nExercise:%s \nDrool:%s" %(self.name, self.friendliness, self.intelligence, self.exercise, self.drool)
        return prnt_str

player_card = Dog_card()
card_count = 0
player.name = dogs_list_player[0]#i think this is where the issue is happening
</code></pre>
<p>the result of this code is:</p>
<pre><code>IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>
<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>your Dog_card class has some errors :
you forget "friendliness" parameter in the string that is in printing_card method and also you have not any constructor in your class .</p>
<pre><code>class Dog_card:

def __init__(self):
    self.name = ""
    self.friendliness = ""
    self.intelligence = ""
    self.exercise = ""
    self.drool = ""

<p>this shoud be work .</p>

<span class="comment-copy">try printing <code>dogs_list_player</code> or <code>len(dogs_list_player)</code> just to check where you think the issue is... btw, your class should actually instatiate its attributes inside a <code>def __init__(self):</code> function, that way you can actually have multiple instances with different attributes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is <code>Y</code> - what is <code>Z</code> - both are used but nowhere set to anything in your code. You use classmembers, read about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#instance-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#instance-objects</a> - first ones are shared between instances, you do not want that for multiple dogs - they all would have the same name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please provide a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@pekapa I have tried printing dogs_list_player and i have shown the result of that above, but for some reason i keep getting the error</span>
