<p>I'm just starting to learn python and I thought a good way to practice would be by building a custom linked list class. I was able to get my custom list to work properly when everything was in one file. However, I wanted to practice importing, so I split my code into three files: ListNode.py, mySLL.py, testMySll.py. All of these files are under the same directory "codingPractice". I'm trying to import listNode.py into mySLL.py and mySLL.py into testMySll.py. How would I do this?</p>

<p>Importing modules in Python is pretty straight forward. For a thorough explanation see this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">guide on modules</a>. However, to give you a quickstart using the examples you provided, you can import modules like this:</p>
<pre><code>    # importing into mySLL.py
    import listNode

    bar = listNode.func(foo)
</code></pre>
<p>The same workflow goes for importing mySSL.py into the testMySll.py file. Keep in mind that imported modules act like objects so you call the functions using <code>module.func</code> and any variables that are global in the module can be called using <code>module.var</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Ended up doing from listNode import ListNode to actually use the ListNode class I made</span>
