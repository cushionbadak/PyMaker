<p>I'm new to Python and I am trying to generate a list of 4 random numbers with integers between 1 and 9. The list must contain no repeating integers.</p>
<p>The issue I am having is that the program doesn't output exactly 4 numbers everytime. Sometimes it generates 3 numbers or 2 numbers and I can't figure out how to fix it.</p>
<p>My code:</p>
<pre><code>import random
lst = []
for i in range(5):
     r = random.randint(1,9)
     if r not in lst: lst.append(r)
print(lst)
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to do it without the random.sample? This code is part of a larger assignment for school and my teacher doesn't want us using the random.sample or random.shuffle functions. </p>

<p>Your code generates 5 random numbers, but they are not necessarily unique. If a <code>2</code> is generated and you already have <code>2</code> in <code>list</code> you don't append it, while you should really be generating an alternative digit that hasn't been used yet.</p>
<p>You could use a <code>while</code> loop to test if you already have enough numbers:</p>
<pre><code>result = []  # best not to use list as a variable name!
while len(result) &lt; 5:
    digit = random.randint(1, 9)
    if digit not in result:
        result.append(digit)
</code></pre>
<p>but that's all more work than really needed, and could in theory take forever (as millions of repeats of the same 4 initial numbers is still considered random). The standard library has a better method for just this task.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.sample()</code></a> to take 5 <em>unique</em> numbers from a <code>range()</code> object:</p>
<pre><code>result = random.sample(range(1, 10), 5)
</code></pre>
<p>This is guaranteed to produce 5 values taken from the range, without duplicate digits, and it does so in 5 steps.</p>
</div>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.sample</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import random
random.sample(range(1, 10), 4)
</code></pre>
<p>This generates a list of four random values between <code>1</code> to <code>9</code> with no duplicates.</p>

<p>Your issue is, you're iterating 5 times, with a random range of 1-9. That means you have somewhere in the neighborhood of a 50/50 chance of getting a repeat integer, which your conditional prevents from being appended to your list. </p>
<p>This will serve you better:</p>
<pre><code>def newRunLst():
     lst = []
     while len(lst) &lt; 4:
          r = random.randint(1,9)
          if r not in lst: lst.append(r)
     print lst
</code></pre>
