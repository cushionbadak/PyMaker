<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am new to Python and trying to match a string to a list of regexes.</p>
<pre><code>import re
str = 'foo'
list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
listofRegex = [r'some*regex[.]pattern', r'some*regex[.]pattern2']

if str in list1 or re.match(rex in listofRegex, str):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can concatenate your expressions with the or operator <code>|</code>. You can then test your sentence/word on all of them together.</p>
<pre><code>import re

r1 = r'lo'
r2 = r'hel.'

listofregex = [r1, r2]
regcombined = re.compile('|'.join(listofregex))
allmatched = regcombined.findall('hello')
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not just combine the expressions into one?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can iterate over the <code>listOfRegex</code> and try to match each regex one by one. For a beginner, a <code>for</code>-loop is suitable for that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, I am new to Python, how can I achieve this? @ninesalt</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you are not familiar enough with Python you should start with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at the <code>any()</code> function. <code>any(re.match(rex, str) for rex in listofRegex)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the answer, I will try this out. Do you know if @Barmar suggestion will work? I am wondering if I can combine his suggestion into my original if block like so  <code>if str in list1 or any(re.match(rex, str) for rex in listofRegex)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@henrylee His answer should work too but it's a slightly more expensive operation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, do you think my if statement will work however if I combine it with his suggestion?   <code>if str in list1 or any(re.match(rex, str) for rex in listofRegex)</code>  Or should his suggestion be in its own if block</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@henrylee <code>any()</code> returns a boolean value, so it should work fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay cool, thanks a lot</span>
