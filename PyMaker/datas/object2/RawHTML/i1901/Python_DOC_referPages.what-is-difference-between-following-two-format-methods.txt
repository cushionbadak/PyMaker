<p>Are these two format() methods are different? If so, then how can i know which class they belong to and how they behave differently?</p>
<pre><code>format('abc') 
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>'abc'.format()
</code></pre>

<p>Your first snippet uses the <code>format</code> built-in function, documented in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> for the built-in functions. Your second snippet uses <code>str.format</code>, a method of the <code>str</code> class, documented in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> for the standard types. These are closely related, but the correspondence doesn't quite work the way you have things.</p>
<p><code>format(thing, 'format_spec')</code> is equivalent to <code>'{:format_spec}'.format(thing)</code>. The format spec defaults to an empty string, so <code>format(thing)</code> is equivalent to <code>'{:}'.format(thing)</code>, which is usually equivalent to <code>str(thing)</code>.</p>
<p><code>format('abc')</code> corresponds to <code>'{}'.format('abc')</code>, not <code>'abc'.format()</code>. The results happen to be equivalent because <code>'abc'</code> is a string with no format placeholders in it. If you had used <code>'I love braces{}'</code> or <code>3</code> instead of <code>'abc'</code>, you would have seen different behavior.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I can't think of a use for either, as posted, so that unites them</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for correcting me.</span>
