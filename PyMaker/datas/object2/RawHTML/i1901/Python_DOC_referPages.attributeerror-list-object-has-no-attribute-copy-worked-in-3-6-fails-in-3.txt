<p>Code extract:</p>
<pre><code>toMatrix  = [0.0] * NumBoth  #Establish dimensions
for i in range(NumBoth):
    toMatrix [i] = [0.0] * NumBoth
for indx in iter(range(NumSvcDep,NumBoth)):

<p>If context matters, I'm setting a matrix to "0"s except for part of the diagonal set to "1"s. While I'd love to hear better ways to do that, my main problem if doing the copy. This ran on V3.6 but fails on v3.7. I'm pretty sure the code hasn't been changed but it's been awhile. </p>

<p>Deep copy of list works a little different:</p>

<p>According to docs, <code>copy</code> is still supported in 3.7 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a></p>
<p>Also, I have a 3.7 on my machine and the <code>copy</code> works fine. (Are you sure 3.7 and not 2.7? :O just asking)</p>
<p>Any way, it's equivalent to the selector <code>[:]</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>list.copy()</p>
<p>Return a shallow copy of the list. Equivalent to [:].</p>

<pre><code>fromMatrix = toMatrix[:]
