<p>Can someone explain the usage of the <code>_</code> in this for loop? </p>
<pre><code>for dirs,_,files in os.walk(directory):
   for f in files:
       yield os.path.abspath(os.path.join(dirs, f))
</code></pre>
<p>My goal is to get the filenames with full path recursively. 
I got this from another question and it does exactly what I want. But I don't understand it. </p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html?highlight=os%20walk#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.walk</code></a> returns the tuple <code>(root, dirs, files)</code> where</p>
<ul>
<li><code>root</code>: the current directory</li>
<li><code>dirs</code>: the files in the current dir</li>
<li><code>files</code>: the files in the current dir</li>
</ul>
<p>if you do not use one of these variables in your subsequent loop, it is customary to call it <code>_</code> (or even append a name such as <code>_dirs</code>). that way most IDEs will not complain that you have assigned a variable but you are not using it.</p>
<p>in your example you could do:</p>
<pre><code>for root, _dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>and the IDE should not complain that you are not using the variable <code>_dirs</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>_</code> is just like any variable like <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> but by convention it means we don't care about it. Also, <code>_</code> will return the most recent output from a Python Interactive Session even though it wasn't stored in any variable</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer">entry in the doc</a> explained the output of <code>os.walk</code>, a 3-tuple: <code>(dirpath, dirnames, filenames)</code>. so the unpacking done there is for <code>dirnames</code></span>
