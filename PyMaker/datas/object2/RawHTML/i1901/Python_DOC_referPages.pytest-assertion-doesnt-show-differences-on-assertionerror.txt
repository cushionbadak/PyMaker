<p>I recently learned about using <em>Pytest</em> for doing unit tests in Python. I've played around with it in <a href="https://repl.it/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Repl.it</a> by doing a simple assertion on two different strings which should fail.</p>
<pre><code>import pytest
assert 'a' == 'b'
</code></pre>
<p>Which fails with the error
<code>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "python", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
AssertionError
</code></p>
<p>However Pytest does not print 'a' or 'b'. This would be really helpful in debugging as I can compare the diff between 2 different strings. The <em>unittest</em> module has this feature by default. Does Pytest have this feature? If not how do I enable it? I'm using Pytest for a larger project and would love to figure this out before continuing work.</p>

<p>If you want see assertion error, you add a string after assert statement. This is not a pytest issue.
Example: <code>assert a == b , "a:{} is not equal to b:{}".format(a,b)</code></p>
<p>This will output:</p>
<pre><code>In [5]: assert a == b , "a:{} is not equal to b:{}".format(a,b)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-5-35a1ba6dcf42&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
----&gt; 1 assert a == b , "a:{} is not equal to b:{}".format(a,b)

AssertionError: a:5 is not equal to b:6

<span class="comment-copy">You have to run that module with pytest, not with regular python!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So if I run <code>pytest main.py</code> on the command line I will see the value of the strings? What about in my larger project, which is an AWS lambda function in python? How would I see the strings then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you have to run <code>pytest main.py</code>. I have no idea about AWS lambda - I don't think it is meant for running standalone applications. <code>pytest</code> is a unit testing framework, it is not meant to be used in regular code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>pytest</code> is to execute tests, not scripts. If you create a script whose name starts with <code>test_</code> and inside a function whose name starts with <code>test_</code>, <code>pytest</code> will find and execute it. See <a href="https://repl.it/@hoefling/so-53001496" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this repl</a> for a working example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My script does start with <code>test_</code> and my function does start with <code>test_</code>. I know that <code>pytest</code> is finding and executing my test but I'm looking for a way for pytest to output the difference between two strings on an AssertionError.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not trying to use the python <code>assert</code>, but rather Pytest's <code>assert.</code> I'm using Pytest because I need a good unit testing framework/ Moreover it seems extremely tedious to add strings after the assert statement every time I use an assert. Does Pytest not have this feature built-in?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Pytest uses python assert. You can write your custom assert function for pytest which will spit out the difference each time you assert equality.
