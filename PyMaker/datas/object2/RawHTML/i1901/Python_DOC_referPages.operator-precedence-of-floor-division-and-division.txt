<p>I have trouble understanding why python returns different results for these 2 statements:</p>
<p><code>-1 // 3/4</code>  and <code>-1 // 0.75</code></p>
<p>The first one returns <code>-0.25</code> and the second on returns <code>-2</code>.</p>
<p>The way i understand it, the <code>/</code> operator is executed before <code>//</code> , thus those 2 statements should have the same result.</p>
<p>edit:
I was referring to a document provided by my university. I misinterpreted that. Official python documentation proves me wrong.
Thanks for all the quick answers.</p>

<p>The <code>/</code> and <code>//</code> operators have the same precedence according to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a> so they are evaluated from left to right when used in the same expression. <code>-1 // 3/4</code> is therefore equivalent to <code>(-1 // 3)/4</code> rather than <code>-1 // (3/4)</code>.</p>

<p>Your understanding is incorrect. <code>/</code> and <code>//</code> have the same precedence and have left associativity, meaning that Python performs the leftmost operation first - in your case, the <code>/</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The Expressions documentation has a section about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Operator Precedence</a>. Operators in the same box have the same precedence.</p>
<p>Thus, the table tells you that <code>//</code> and <code>/</code> have equal precedence, so</p>
<p><code>-1 // 3/4</code> parses as </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (-1//3)/4
&gt;&gt;&gt; -0.25
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>no, they have the same precedence, so they're evaluated from left to right.</p>
<p><code>-1//3</code> is rounded (to the least integer) integer division, so you get <code>-1</code> divided by <code>4</code>: <code>0.25</code></p>
<p>When you have doubts, it doesn't cost much to throw in a couple of parentheses.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Think of these from an order of operations standpoint:</p>
<pre><code>-1 // 3/4
</code></pre>
<p>This will perform <code>-1</code> "floor" <code>3</code>, which yields <code>-1</code>, which then divided by <code>4</code> yields <code>-0.25</code>.</p>
<p>Whereas:</p>
<pre><code>-1 // 0.75
</code></pre>
<p>This will simply "floor" the operation straight away and yield <code>-2.0</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>According to documentation, <code>Multiplication *</code>, <code>matrix multiplication @</code>, <code>division /</code>, <code>floor division //</code>, <code>remainder %</code> all have same precedence.</p>
<p>When two operators have the same precedence, associativity helps to determine the order of operations.</p>
<p>Now regarding your question; both <code>/</code> and <code>//</code> have same precedence, and if both of them are present in an expression, left one is evaluated first based on <strong>left-to-right associativity</strong>. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>// is essentially an operator for flooring division.</p>
<p>So 1 // 0.75 is essentially flooring 1.333 which is 1</p>
<p>-1 // 0.75 is essentially flooring -1.333 which is -2.</p>
<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I was referring to a document provided by my university. It says 'At the top are the operators with the highest priority' - in case you do not speak german. I think it is easy to see how i misinterpreted the document. <a href="https://moodle.studiumdigitale.uni-frankfurt.de/moodle3/pluginfile.php/56934/mod_resource/content/1/Programmierhandzettel%201.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link to reference</a> @Prune</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not at all easy :-)  : the document is not generally available.  Also, any source material should get edited into your question.  In any case, I think it's a moot point: several people have answered your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">your provided link will not be accessible to anyone unless they are staff/student at your university.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's the idea.  You also did right by up-voting useful posts and choosing an answer.  Thanks.</span>
