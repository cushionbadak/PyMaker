<p>I would like to know if it is possible to limit the amount of time a print statement appears in the user console. I have a project that is a Contact Manager and it used a CSV file to store the contact data. The program is designed to create a new CSV file in the even that one is not available in the directory. If I run the program without the CSV file in the directory I have the console display a message to the user letting them know that a new file was created. I would like to have this message only display for maybe 10 seconds or so then disappear from the console. Is this possible? If so I would appreciate some suggestions. Below is the portion of the code that checks for the CSV file then creates a new one and notifies the user if a new one has been created.</p>
<pre><code>    def read_contacts():
        try:
           contacts = []
           with open(FILENAME, newline="") as file:
                reader = csv.reader(file)
                for row in reader:
                    contacts.append(row)
           return contacts
        except FileNotFoundError:
           print("Could not find " + FILENAME + " file!\n + "Starting new contacts file...\n")
</code></pre>
<p>At this point the code continues to create a new CSV file. What I would like to do is have the previous print statement disappear after 10 seconds so that it doesn't display in the console the entire time the program is running. </p>

<p>You can use the carriage return ("\r") to go back to the beginning of the printed line, wait for 10 seconds, and then replace the text. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>import time
def read_contacts():
    try:
        contacts = []
        with open(FILENAME, newline="") as file:
            reader = csv.reader(file)
            for row in reader:
                contacts.append(row)
        return contacts
    except FileNotFoundError:
        msg = "Could not find " + FILENAME + " file! Starting new contacts file..."
        print(msg, end="\r")
        time.sleep(10)
        print(" " * len(msg), end="\r")
</code></pre>

<p>Another alternative approach can be using the <strong>\033[F</strong> character:
(Since you do not want the delay to interrupt the remaining script, take advantage of python <strong>threading</strong> library)</p>
<pre><code>import sys
import time
import threading

def func():
    time.sleep(10)
    sys.stdout.write("\033[F")

def read_contacts():
    try:
       contacts = []
       with open(FILENAME, newline="") as file:
            reader = csv.reader(file)
            for row in reader:
                contacts.append(row)
       return contacts
    except FileNotFoundError:
       errmsg="Could not find " + FILENAME + " file!\n + "Starting new contacts file...\n"
       print(errmsg)
       t = threading.Thread(target=func)
       t.start()
       #remaining code
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank You for your input. I tried this way but in may case it just gives a 10 second delay after printing the 'msg' prior to starting the actual program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank You, in my case this gives a 10 second delay prior to starting the remainder of the program. The message still displays after that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have modified my answer according to your requirement. Give this a try. <b>Note: I have assumed you don't have any prints after the line <code>print(errmsg)</code></b>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank You for the update, I may be still doing something wrong or missing something because I changed my code to what you have provided and I am not getting a change in the function. It still works like before with the error message coming up and staying for the entirety of the program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">\033[F is unable to remove '\n' characters. Got this after some trial and error. Hence in your case, try using <code>print("\033[3A\033[K")</code> instead of <code>sys.stdout.write("\033[F")</code>. Also, if you are using python3.x, have a look at this one using curses: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6840420/python-rewrite-multiple-lines-in-the-console" title="python rewrite multiple lines in the console">stackoverflow.com/questions/6840420/â€¦</a></span>
