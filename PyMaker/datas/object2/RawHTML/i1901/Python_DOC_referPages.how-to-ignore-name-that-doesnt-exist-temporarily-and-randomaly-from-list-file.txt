<p>I have a list of names within a file.</p>
<p>Each time my program turns to one name from the list, and extracts data.</p>
<p>The problem is that sometimes some of the name(s) are not available (temporarily and randomaly). </p>
<p>A name that was unavailable yesterday, will be available today. but, another name that was available yesterday, will not be available today).</p>
<p>As soon as the program reach unavailable name then the program gets stuck.</p>
<p>What can you do for the program to skip a name(s) that is not available at this moment? so that the program always work and not get stuck.</p>
<p>Hope i am clear... :)</p>
<p>my list:</p>
<p>Name_1</p>
<p>Name_2</p>
<p>Name_3</p>
<p>Name_4</p>
<p>Name_5</p>
<p>my program:</p>
<pre><code>with open('D:\My_Path.txt', 'r') as fp:
    Names = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in fp.readlines()] 

for Name in (Names):
    '''Do something'''
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>use a <code>try</code> / <code>except</code> statement with the error you get as an exception.</p>
<pre><code>with open('D:\My_Path.txt', 'r') as fp:
    Names = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in fp.readlines()] 

for Name in (Names):
    try:
        '''Do something'''
    except UnboundLocalError:
        print('%s not available'%Name)
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT: I don't know what '''Do something''' is. Apparently it gives an <code>UnboundLocalError</code> if the <code>Name</code> does not exist. It is good practice to look exactly which statement cause this error and put this exception in the <code>try/except</code> block.

<span class="comment-copy">what error do you get if the program gets stuck?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@onno, i got this error: UnboundLocalError: local variable 'path' referenced before assignment</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Add that  '''Do something''' part please, otherwise you should go ahead with the try/except statement.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ssein, "Do something" is some mathematical calculations only. the error came before the calculations. I tried to use try/except as anno say, but still got the same error. each time (OTHER DAY), the program stuck at other name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@onno. Thanks to you, it works great !!!</span>
