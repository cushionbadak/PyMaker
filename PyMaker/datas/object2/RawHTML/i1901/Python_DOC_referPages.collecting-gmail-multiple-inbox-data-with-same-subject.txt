<span class="comment-copy">You can start by reading this tutorial to get familiar with using python with emails since you have posted any issues with code sounds you like you haven't tried anything yet. I hope this gives you a good idea on where to start. <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter16/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter16/</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. Can u please tell me how to prevent my python file from editing by malicious users.I want some security that no one could edit my python file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand, how would malicious have access to your file? I would recommend to just keep any sensitive information out of your python file like passwords and tokens so you won't have to worry about anyone accessing the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but man the file would be on public server.i dont want anyone to edit my file and play with it.i hope u r getting my point.Is there any way i can lock the file from editing only.Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you should google this I can't think of a solution. Sorry!</span>
