<p>I just have pushed my project to heroku and suddenly I am getting the following error:</p>
<pre><code>/profile/list/48
unsupported locale setting
Error during template rendering
In template /app/Clientes/templates/Clientes/base.html, error at line 0
</code></pre>
<p>The thing is that I am running this project without any problems localy and in Heroku the error appears in a detail view. </p>
<p>I do not think that the problem is located in any of my files, but if requested I can post it here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order to reduce the stack image size, the heroku 16 stack doesn't include language packs by default.
  You may still want to use a custom language pack though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can add the <code>heroku-buildpack-locales</code> buildpack by running</p>
<pre><code>heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-locale
</code></pre>
<p>Then create a new <code>.locales</code> file in the root of your repository containing</p>
<pre><code>pt_BR.UTF-8
</code></pre>
<p>commit it and push to Heroku. This should let you use the locale.</p>

<p>After I had the following code inside my filter file:</p>
<pre><code>locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'pt_BR.UTF-8')
</code></pre>
<p>The solution is given by Chris in this post.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you try to set the locale anywhere in your project? Possibly directly via <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/locale.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python's <code>locale</code></a> or indirectly via Django's <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/i18n/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">internationalization and localization</a> features?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I found it inside my filter file, where I was converting a number to Brazilian standards.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great, that is exactly what I need! Thank you so much for the answer!</span>
