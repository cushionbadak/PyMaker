<p>As a beginner in Python, I think the biggest problem I have is overcomplicating a problem when it can be done a lot simpler. I have not found a solution for a list that is not two-dimensional, hence why I chose to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Here is an example of what I am trying to do:</strong></p>
<pre><code># Before
alphabet = ["ABCDEFG",
            "HIJKLMN",
            "OPQRSTU"]
# After
rotated_alphabet = ["OHA",
                    "PIB",
                    "QJC",
                    "RKD",
                    "SLE",
                    "TMF",
                    "UNG"]     
</code></pre>
<p><strong>What I have done so far:</strong></p>
<pre><code>length_of_column = len(alphabet)
length_of_row = len(alphabet[0])
temp_list = []

x = -1
for i in range(length_of_column):
    while x &lt; length_of_row-1:
        x += 1
        for row in alphabet:
            temp_list.append(row[x])

temp_list = temp_list[::-1]
</code></pre>
<p>Output</p>
<pre><code>print(temp_list)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ['U', 'N', 'G', 'T', 'M', 'F', 'S','L','E','R','K','D','Q','J','C','P','I','B', 'O', 'H', 'A']
</code></pre>
<p>I need to make the list above in the desired format. </p>
<p>-How would I do this? </p>
<p>-Is there a simpler way to do it?</p>

<p>You can just <code>zip</code> the list of strings, and it will make tuples character by character, then you'll only have to join the tuples in reverse order. Here it is in just one line:</p>
<pre><code>rotated_alphabet = [''.join(list(i)[::-1]) for i in zip(*alphabet)]
</code></pre>

<p>A variant of @MuhammadAhmad answer will be to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reversed" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reversed</a>, as reversed works with iterables, no need to convert to a list.</p>
<pre><code>alphabet = ["ABCDEFG",
            "HIJKLMN",
            "OPQRSTU"]

rotated = [''.join(reversed(a)) for a in zip(*alphabet)]
print(rotated)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<pre><code>['OHA', 'PIB', 'QJC', 'RKD', 'SLE', 'TMF', 'UNG']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You do really have 2D data. Strings are iterable like lists. You could also just map <code>list</code> over each string to get a 2D list. And look up how to transpose a matrix, since that's essentially what you're trying to do here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Carcigenicate, I cannot use 2D lists in this situation, as stated in the question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">They stated that your program cannot use a 2D list anywhere? Even if the input is a list of Strings, you're likely able to manipulate the input however you like. Even if you aren't, looking up how to transpose a matrix may still help. You just won't be able to mutate the lists. You'll just need to reassign the strings instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>["".join([l[i] for l in alphabet][::-1]) for i in range(7)]</code>. The join makes the string from the list created. The <code>[::-1]</code> reverse the list.</span>
