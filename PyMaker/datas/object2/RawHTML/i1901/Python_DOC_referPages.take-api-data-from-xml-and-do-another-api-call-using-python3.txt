<p>I've got XML API data from which I need to take a value and run another API call from it.</p>

<p>There's about 100 clients in this file and what I need is to be able to take the ClientID value for each one and run it through another API call (I'm assuming I can set it as a variable?)</p>
<p>How would I go about taking the multiple client IDs and running them through api calls to get more data? </p>

<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ElementTree</code></a> to extract the data and then feed that into a list to make your second API call. This post might help:
