<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am aware of dictionaries and collection.Counters in Python.
My question is how can I make one that takes index of the string into account?
For example for this string: aaabaaa
I would like to make a tuples that contain each string in progression, keeping track of the count going left to right and resetting the count once a new alphanumeric is found.
For example, I like to see this output:
 [('a', 3), ('b', 1), ('a', 3)] </p>
<p>Any idea how to use the dictionary / Counter/ or is there some other data structure built into Python I can use?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby" rel="nofollow noreferrer">groupby</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import groupby

m = [(k, sum(1 for _ in v)) for k, v in groupby('aaabaaa')]

print(m)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output</strong></p>
<pre><code>[('a', 3), ('b', 1), ('a', 3)]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>The groupby function makes an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the iterable, in this case <code>'aaabaaa'</code>. The key <code>k</code> is the value identifying of the group, <code>['a', 'b', 'a']</code>. The <code>sum(1 for _ in v)</code> count the amount of elements in the group.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi and welcome to SO! It will be great if you can also include the code snippet that you have tried, results or expected results to help people understand your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can't map multiple things to the same key in a dictionary.  I suppose that there are the concepts of mutli-dicts in some languages which you could spoof in python using a <code>defaultdict(list)</code> or something ... Anyway, in this case, I think maybe you're better off using <code>itertools</code>.  :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thx for your reply, but I copied your code into my Python 3 environment and am getting this error: SyntaxError: invalid syntax How would I assign it to a variable, could I just do something like this: m = [] m = [(k, sum(1 for _ in v)) for k, v in groupby('aaabaaa')]  That above is also giving me an error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@fynx Updated the answer to include a variable assignment! Just remove <code>m = []</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ignore the previous comment, its working, thx for your help</span>
