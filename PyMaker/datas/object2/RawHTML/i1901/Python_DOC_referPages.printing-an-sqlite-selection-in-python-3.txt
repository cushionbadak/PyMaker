<p>So I just started working with sqlite in Python (and I am a beginner with Python as well), and I'm struggling with using the data from a Table.
Basically, I created my database but now I would like to do something with the data. I have tried just simply printing it using this function:</p>
<pre><code>def Select():
surname = input("Whose birthdate would you like to know? (surname)\n")
print(c.execute("SELECT Birthday FROM People WHERE Surname=?", (surname,)))
</code></pre>
<p>but this is what gets printed when I call on the function.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;sqlite3.Cursor object at 0x0000020825545F10&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Anybody know what the fix for this is?
Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>You have to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.fetchone" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fetchone</a> function of the cursor to get one record or you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.fetchall" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fetchall</a> to get all the row of the query.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using the method fetchone or fetch many.</p>
<pre><code>print(c.fetchone())
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>print(c.fetchmany())
</code></pre>
<p>you can see the documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here.</a></p>
