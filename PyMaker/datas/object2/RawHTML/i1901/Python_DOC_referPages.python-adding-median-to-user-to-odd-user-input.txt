<p>I'm trying to get the Median of the users given salary. Is it easy to implement it to the current code?</p>
<pre><code> def Lista():

    values = []
    print("Give your salary from smallest number to largerst.")
    while True:
        sum1 = int(input("Give your salary (0 ends): "))

        if sum1 == 0:
            print("Salary average:",sum(values)/len(values))
            print("Salary minimum:",min(values))
            print("Salary maximum:",max(values))
            print("Salary median:",values[len(values)/2])
            return False

        else:
            values.append(sum1)

    return Lista

Lista()
</code></pre>
<p>Can't seem to be able to do it myself.
I'd use only odd numbers of asked salary</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is one way to get the solution integer the value and the length;  </p>
<pre><code>int(values[int(len(values)/2)])
</code></pre>
<p>Also I noticed in the average that it's the only one that ends in xxxx.0, this can be edited to be the same as others by editing it like this;</p>
<pre><code>int(sum(values)/len(values))
</code></pre>
<p>So the full code would look like this</p>
<pre><code>def Lista():

    values = []
    print("Give your salary from smallest number to largerst.")
    while True:
        sum1 = int(input("Give your salary (0 ends): "))

        if sum1 == 0:
            print("Salary average:",int(sum(values)/len(values)))
            print("Salary minimum:",min(values))
            print("Salary maximum:",max(values))
            print("Salary median:",int(values[int(len(values)/2)]))
            return False

        else:
            values.append(sum1)

    return Lista

Lista()
</code></pre>
<p>Hopefully this helps :)
E: sum were overlapping, changed it to sum1</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">you are overwriting <code>sum</code> in <code>sum = int(input("Give your salary (0 ends): "))</code>. so it will not do what you expect later in the code (at <code>sum(values)</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the comment, it wasn't sum in the original version but translated (so it's easier to read) it and didn't notice that it was overwriting it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just in case: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.median" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.median</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, in my own version I wasn't using sum, as this is a translation to get easier view of the problem. Thanks for the reply, it works now =)</span>
