<p>whilst digging into encoding/decoding, I found the following part in binascii.py:</p>
<pre><code>def a2b_base64(*args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
""" Decode a line of base64 data. """
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>From my naive understanding, this is implemented as C somewhere else. Is this in the python.exe itself or am I missing something?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is <em>no <code>binascii.py</code> file</em> in the Python standard library. The <code>binascii</code> module in Python is entirely written in C; it's implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/binascii.c" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Modules/binascii.c</code> source file</a>.</p>
<p>When Python is installed on a system, available as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shared library object</a>, so as a <code>.so</code> or <code>.dll</code> file in a <code>lib/pythonx.x/lib-dynload</code> directory somewhere.</p>
<p>What you found instead is a <em>stub file</em>, to aid an IDE in introspection and autocompletion tasks. Such a file is needed because extension modules written in C usually are not introspectable, you can't always use the normal <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">introspection techniques</a> to figure out what arguments a function written in a compiled language will accept.</p>
<p>Note that such files are slowly becoming obsolete as more and more code in the standard library is being converted to using the new <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/clinic.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">argument clinic system</a>, which enables introspection support. The <code>binascii</code> module has been updated to use the AC syntax starting in Python 3.4, so you could ask the module directly:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import inspect, binascii
&gt;&gt;&gt; inspect.signature(binascii.a2b_base64)
&lt;Signature (data, /)&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The function accepts a single positional-only argument named <code>data</code> (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24735311/python-what-does-the-slash-mean-in-the-output-of-helprange">Python: What does the slash mean in the output of help(range)?</a> for an explanation for what the <code>/</code> in the signature means or what <em>positional only</em> means).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your posted code snippet does nothing</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The Python library <b>has no <code>binascii.py</code> file</b>. Are you looking at something else, like stub files for autocompletion in an IDE perhaps?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I seem to have been looking at the stub file whilst 'over-using' CTRL+B in pycharm. How does python know where the following line is then? return binascii.a2b_base64(s)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Absolutely great reply. Thanks so much!</span>
