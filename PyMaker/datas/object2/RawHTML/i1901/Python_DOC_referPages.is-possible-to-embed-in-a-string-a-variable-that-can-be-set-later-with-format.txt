<p>Recently I have seen a code with a method of a class that suggests me this but I've not seen anything like this in the documentation.</p>
<pre><code>class MyClass():
    def __init__(self, filepath):
        self.filepath = filepath
        self.total_steps = 0

    def my_func(self, step, logs={}):
        self.total_steps += 1
        filepath = self.filepath.format(step=self.total_steps, **logs)
        self.another_func(filepath)
    [...]
</code></pre>
<p>I think that this code permits me to use a <code>filepath</code> variable with some inner-parameter <code>step</code> that could be updated through <code>format</code> whenever I want. However, I'm not able to pass <code>filepath</code> such that it is influenced by <code>format(step=self.total_steps, **logs)</code>.</p>
<p>So my question is: is it possible to define a string with a parameter that could be changed with <code>format</code> method?</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you want to know the original code I could post here or could you give a check by yourself at <code>keras-rl</code> library on github. It's in the <code>ModelIntervalCheckpoint</code> class in the <a href="https://github.com/keras-rl/keras-rl/blob/master/rl/callbacks.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>callbacks.py</code></a> file.</p>

<p>in order to be able to format your filepath, you need to include a "placeholder" named "step" in your filepath string.</p>
<pre><code>a = MyClass("/foo/bar/{step}/bla")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The <code>filepath</code> string would have to contain <code>'{step}'</code>, which would be replaced by what's provided as keyword argument in <code>.format(step=...)</code>. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure how to go about answering this... it should be obvious how to do that if you have any idea what the <code>format</code> method does.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aran-Fey Yeah, you're right. And now I know another feature of format. I don't know why I missed it before.</span>
