<p>I am trying to access a folder containing 50 .wav file samples (that I will use for my Gender Voice Classification (using PCA) project), but I cant seem to be able to access the folder properly.
The folder is unzipped of course.</p>
<p>the folder containing the file samples is named "SoundSamples", that is inside another folder named "soundFile" that is located on the desktop.</p>
<p>I am running the code below: </p>
<pre><code>import os

raw_folder = '//Desktop//soundFile//SoundSamples//'
for file in os.listdir(raw_folder):
    print(file)
    filepath = os.path.join(raw_folder, file)
    f = open(filepath, 'r')
    print(f.read())
    f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>The output I get is an error saying "no such file or directory: '//Desktop//soundFile//SoundSamples//' "</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You cannot access the <em>relative</em> path to your Desktop folder by starting with the <em>absolute</em> path <code>/Desktop/..</code>. As a regular user, your desktop folder is stored somewhere deeper -- typically, something like <code>/Users/<em>(yourname)</em>/Desktop</code>. But don't hardcode that, Python can find the home folder for you!</p>
<pre><code>import os
from os.path import expanduser

home = expanduser("~")
print home
raw_folder = home+'/Desktop/soundFile/SoundSamples'
for file in os.listdir(raw_folder):
    print(file)
</code></pre>
<p>The OS function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.expanduser" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>expanduser</code></a> locates your home folder and returns it as a string. Then you can paste on whatever folder you are looking for -- <code>Desktop</code>, <code>Documents</code>, or any other path relative to your home.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your filepath should be:</p>
<p>Desktop/soundFile/SoundSamples</p>
<p>(You don't need double forward slashes)</p>
<p>Assuming that you're running it from your home directory, otherwise specify the full filepath:</p>
<p>/Users/your_username/Desktop/soundFile/SoundSamples</p>
<p>(where your_username is your username)</p>
<p>I'd also suggest using the <code>with open(file, 'r') as f:</code> method of reading or writing to files, as Python will automatically close it for you</p>
<pre><code>import os

raw_folder = 'Desktop/soundFile/SoundSamples'
for file in os.listdir(raw_folder):
    print(file)
    filepath = os.path.join(raw_folder, file)
    with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
        print(f.read())
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried using the full path? C:/Users/yourUser/Desktop/soundFile/SoundSamples</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>'//Desktop//soundFile//SoundSamples//'</code>  is not a valid path.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Consider: <code>os.path.abspath("Desktop") != os.path.abspath("//Desktop")</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The folder in <code>os.listdir()</code> should either be an absolute path or a relative (sub)folder from your current working directory. Also forward slashes don't need to be escaped.  You're probably looking for <code>C:/Users/yourusername/Desktop/soundFile/SoundSamples</code> (replace yourusername with your actual username, obviously).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You nee the whole directroy and if you are usign os you can just use fsenconde something like  deirectory= os.fsencode(r"C:\Users\YourUsernmae\Desktop\soundFile\SoundSamples)</span>
