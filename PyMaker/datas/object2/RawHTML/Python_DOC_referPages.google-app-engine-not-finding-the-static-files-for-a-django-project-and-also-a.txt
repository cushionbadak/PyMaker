<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I made a website on Django and wish to deploy it to Google App Engine, 
the website itself is deployed but without all the static files. </p>
<p>Also, there's a dataset in a .txt file that my website depends upon to run (It's a machine learning project.), but it's not able to find it and the browser just throws a file not found error.</p>
<p>it would be super cool if someone could help me out.</p>
<p>here's the app.yaml file.</p>
<pre><code>runtime: python37
entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT predictweb.wsgi
handlers:
- url: /static
  static_dir: static/
- url: /.*
  script: auto
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>At least in the 1st generation standard environment (python 2.7) the static files/directories would by default be separated from the application code, one would have to add <code>application_readable: true</code> to also have a copy together with the app code. See details in the post linked in @lusitanica's comment.</p>
<p>But that's not clearly stated in the 2nd generation <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/config/appref#handlers_element" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>handlers</code> doc</a>. The separation is kinda implied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of the files in the given directory are uploaded as static files
  and none of them can be run as scripts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there's no mentioning of <code>application_readable</code>. Still, I think it's worth a try, other configs weren't documented for a while but they were working, see comments to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54833147/4495081">this post</a>.</p>
<p>Another thought, assuming that maybe you followed some generic django guide which is typically showing how to server the static content <em>via django</em> - i.e. via the application, not via the CDN-like GAE method (which is how it's served if configured in <code>app.yaml</code>).</p>
<p>It's likely possible to make it work through <code>app.yaml</code>. At least I see in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/python/django/appengine#understanding_the_code" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Running Django on App Engine Standard Environment</a>. Maybe check your <code>settings.py</code>, I see in the github version references in the doc:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code># Static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images)
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/static-files/

STATIC_ROOT = 'static'
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>But I'm not a django user, can't help with more details.</p>
<p>If none of the above is working you could also just take the <code>static_dir</code> config out of the <code>app.yaml</code> and let django serve the static content. Not optimal, I know - using app CPU cycles.</p>
<p>As for the <code>.txt</code> file, </p>
<pre><code>Exception Value: /srv/pages\songdatabase1.txt not found 
</code></pre>
<p>shows a couple of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>you're mixing windows path separator <code>\</code> with the *nix one <code>/</code>. You need the *nix one on GAE, but it's better to just use <code>os.path.join()</code> instead of manually manipulating the path</li>
<li>you're using a full path - you should use paths relative to the app top dir (where the <code>app.yaml</code> file exists). In your case it should be <code>pages/songdatabase1.txt</code></li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">Please don't post text as images. Instead copy-paste it into the post and format it accordingly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where is your <code>.txt</code> file located (relative to <code>app.yaml</code>)? Show the code trying to access it. What's the URL you're using for one of your static files and what's the actual file location?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the .txt file is in /project-name/pages/ directory where the views.py file lives. it throws this error  OSError at / /srv/pages\songdatabase1.txt not found. Request Method:	POST Request URL:	&lt;site-url&gt; Django Version:	2.1.7 Exception Type:	OSError Exception Value:	 /srv/pages\songdatabase1.txt not found. Exception Location:	/env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/lib/_datasource.py in open, line 624 Python Executable:	/env/bin/python3.7 Python Version:	3.7.2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good edit. For the future - it's also recommended to just edit the question and add the details in it - comments have poor formatting support, limited size (and may disappear).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">1) my settings.py file has those two lines, 2) I tried adding the application_readable bit in the app.yaml file but it just throws an error saying that its not needed in python37 runtime environment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I still think it's some django setting. Check carefully the request paths when running locally and on GAE, they're likely assembled wrong. I see the unexpected <code>/srv</code> prefix on the <code>.txt</code> file, for example. Full paths are OK for static content - URLs</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did not use the join() function correctly, its now able to find the txt file. It was an issue of the slashes after all, so thank you so much!</span>
