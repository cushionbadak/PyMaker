<p>I am trying to simply skip over a record that is found within my relevant excel file as: empty, blank, or 'N/A'. I want the script to continue or skip; not stop if a record is found empty, N/A.</p>
<p>I am trying the below, but the script is still stopping at a blank, or N/A found record in the excel file....</p>
<pre><code>    for row in excel_data.itertuples():
        mrn = row.MRN

        if mrn in ("", " ", "N/A", None) or math.isnan(mrn):
            print(f"Invalid record: {row}")
            excel_data = excel_data.drop(excel_data.index[row.Index])
        else:
            num_valid_records += 1

    print(f"Processing #{num_valid_records} records")
</code></pre>
<p><strong>More context:</strong></p>
<p>I'm importing data from an excel file, to pandas, to a web page (web form). </p>
<ul>
<li>I noticed the excel file has a few cells with values as 'N/A'.</li>
<li>In the pandas data frame a few values are also outputting as 'NaT'.</li>
<li>Currently as is my script is stopping when excepting a Date record
from a cell, but instead this cell contains a 'N/A'. This entry is
not required, so I just want it to skip if N/A is found, instead of stopping.</li>
<li>I want it to simply skip this problem cell (i.e. found blank, or
within N/A') and continue with the other records.</li>
</ul>

<p>Find a true positive and use that record as a test.  Alternatively, they may be evaluating to nan in your pandas dataframe, therefore a good ole .dropna() may do the trick for you.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I tested your code, and the code does not stop in <code>Blank</code> or <code>NaN</code> or <code></code> values. There should be something wrong in your data. Just print out the row that stops your code to see what's the value of that column is. Alternately, you can check for null values with python functions like: <code>is None</code> or <code>== None</code> or something like that.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I've added more details, the script doesn't continue to the next record with my efforts, it just stops.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">does it go inside of <code>if</code> block?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please add a snapshot of your data as <code>example data</code>.

<span class="comment-copy">Can you try exception handling here, if there is na value catch valueerror:</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is your expected output? Dont think your question is hard to solve. Its just hard to understand what your data looks like and what your goal is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, Do I really want to DROP it, or just skip it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In the pandas dataframe, a few of the records are outputting 'NaT'</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>NaT</code> looks weird. Please check the actual values of data and user <code>UTF8</code> format. Maybe there are some issues with the encoding of your data</span>
