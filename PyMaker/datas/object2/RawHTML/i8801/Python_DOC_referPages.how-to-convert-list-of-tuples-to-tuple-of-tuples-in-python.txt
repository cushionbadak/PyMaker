<pre><code>list1= [('2', '297'), ('6', '297')]

for x in list1:
    print("inside fn")
    print(x)
    tuple_of_tuples+=tuple(x)
    print(tuple_of_tuples)
</code></pre>
<p>output = <code>('2', '297', '6', '297')</code>
I want output as <code>(('2', '297'), ('6', '297'))</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">please help me on this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The comma is what makes the tuple, the parentheses are only needed for disambiguation. A single-element tuple is denoted by a comma.
