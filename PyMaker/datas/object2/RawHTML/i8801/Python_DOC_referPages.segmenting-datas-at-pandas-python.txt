<p>I have a problem with segmenting a pd.DataFrame (or pd.Series) at a point the value switches.</p>
<p>For example, I have a data like</p>
<pre><code>list('AAAAABBBBBAAABBBCCCCBBBBAAAAA')
</code></pre>
<p>as you can see, As and Bs and Cs are arranged in chunks.</p>
<p>What is the most pythonic way to manage them in to segments?</p>
<p>I believe the code will be produce a array-like data that is like:</p>
<pre><code>list('00000111112223334445555666677777')
</code></pre>
<p>which is a list of the names for the segments.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Most pythonic way would be using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itertools.groupby()</a> </p>
<p>But your output format needs some work as it only holds 10 numbers (0-9) what's the difference between character '11' and '1' when it's repeated several times like that.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks a lot! my output format was just to avoid the lousy [0,0,0,0,1, ... ] which  could have been veeery long.</span>
