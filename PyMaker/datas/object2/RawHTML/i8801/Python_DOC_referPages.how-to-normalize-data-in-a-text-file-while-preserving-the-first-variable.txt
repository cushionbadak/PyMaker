<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text file with this format:</p>
<pre><code>1   10.0e+08   1.0e+04   1.0
2    9.0e+07   9.0e+03   0.9
2    8.0e+07   8.0e+03   0.8
3    7.0e+07   7.0e+03   0.7
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to preserve the first variable of every line and to then normalize the data for all lines by the data on the first line. The end result would look something like;</p>
<pre><code>1   1.0   1.0   1.0
2   0.9   0.9   0.9
2   0.8   0.8   0.8
3   0.7   0.7   0.7
</code></pre>
<p>so essentially, we are doing the following:</p>
<pre><code>1   10.0e+08/10.0e+08   1.0e+04/1.0e+04   1.0/1.0
2    9.0e+07/10.0e+08   9.0e+03/1.0e+04   0.9/1.0
2    8.0e+07/10.0e+08   8.0e+03/1.0e+04   0.8/1.0
3    7.0e+07/10.0e+08   7.0e+03/1.0e+04   0.7/1.0
</code></pre>
<p>I'm still researching and reading on how to do this. I'll upload my attempt shortly. Also can anyone point me to a place where I can learn more about manipulating data files?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Read your file into a numpy array and use numpy broadcast feature:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
data = np.loadtxt('foo.txt')
data = data / data[0]
#array([[ 1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ,  1.  ],
#       [ 2.  ,  0.09,  0.9 ,  0.9 ],
#       [ 2.  ,  0.08,  0.8 ,  0.8 ],
#       [ 3.  ,  0.07,  0.7 ,  0.7 ]])
np.savetxt('new.txt', data)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">how big is your file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A few thousand lines</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added a line to the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there any way to write this data out in the same format that the data was read in? (without comma's and square brackets). Also, when I run this for data with more lines it seems to hide/delete data in the middle. I see the first 6 lines followed by ,,,. and then the last 6 lines. Where's all the data?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Numpy does not display the whole array, unless you ask it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This seems to have done the trick..... awesome! I really appreciate the help! Any suggestions where I can start learning or material that will help a beginner such as myself?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">May I shamelessly direct you to my book.  <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/dzpyds/data-science-essentials-in-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pragprog.com/book/dzpyds/data-science-essentials-in-python</a></span>
