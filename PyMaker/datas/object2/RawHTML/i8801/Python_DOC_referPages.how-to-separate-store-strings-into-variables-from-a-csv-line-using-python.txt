<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>how can I separate and store strings from a CSV line for example;</p>
<p>I have this string: </p>
<pre><code>data = "product name, description, weight, shipping dest"
</code></pre>
<p>and I want to save into python variables like this:</p>
<pre><code>a = "product name"
b = "description"
c = "weight"
d = "shipping dest"
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the string's split function:</p>
<pre><code>data = "product name, description, weight, shipping dest"
a, b, c, d = data.split(', ')
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the Python 2.7 reference for it: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.split</a></p>
<p>And here's the reference for Python 3:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#str.split</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">If its a csv file you should use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv</a> module. There are probably a ton of SO answers showing how to do this, so I wont repeat them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, Its not accutaly a CSV file, just a string received from a barcode seperated by commas.</span>
