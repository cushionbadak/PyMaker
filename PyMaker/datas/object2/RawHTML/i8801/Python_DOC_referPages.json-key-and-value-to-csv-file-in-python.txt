<span class="comment-copy">That isn't valid JSON. Is that example supposed to represent multiple JSON documents, one per line? Or is it just a typo that there are no commas between objects?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your code actually has bug, this is what I got by running your code: Traceback (most recent call last): File "csv_test.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt; key, values_txt = rec ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack The variable <i>rec</i> is a array consists of only one element, which is the entire line of your json file. You can refer to @mhawke's answer for the right solution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How to write the same in col1 and col2, instead of writing them in col1 only??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">They are in column 1 and column 2 if you treat <i>space</i> as the field delimiter (as does your example). If you want a different delimiter specify that when you instantiate the <code>csv.writer</code>, or you can omit it if you want a comma.</span>
