<p>I want PyCharm to warn me when I forgot to declare types for a function or a variable. Is there any way to make PyCharm do that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Syntax for variable annotations PyCharm 2016.3
  EAP brings support for the new PEP 526 Python 3.6 standard, which
  introduces the syntax for type annotations of variables including
  class variables and instance variables. That means PyCharm now
  recognizes the new syntax and uses this meta information about types
  for type inference. Ultimately this positively affects code
  completion, inspections and error checking</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really doubt it's possible to make PyCharm forcing declaring types. It's not a statically typed language and declaring types should be optional.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">No, I meant <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">actual variable types when I declare them</a>, like <code>numbers: List[int] = [1,2,3]</code>. I hear this is new on Python 3.6.</span>
