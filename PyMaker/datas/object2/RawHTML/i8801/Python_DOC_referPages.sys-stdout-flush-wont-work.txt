<p>I'm trying to get the code to return both the X and Y coordinates to the screen at the same time, but what I get after clicking in the window a few times is something that look like:</p>
<p>123 200</p>
<p>443 67</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>After I close the window the program spits out the last "84" and then reads:</p>
<p>123 200</p>
<p>443 67</p>
<p>104 84</p>
<p>But I want it to do that while i'm still in the window clicking on new points.
Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong.</p>

<p>Fixed it&gt; I was running in a old version of wing IDE 5.0.9 to be exact, so I updated to 6.0.1 and it worked. </p>
<p>Note: My friend was using version 5.1.0 and it worked fine on his too. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Does it work if you run python with the <code>-u</code> argument?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KlausD. I'm not familiar with '-u', I am really quite new to python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Usually people get familar with things just by trying them. Run <code>python -u yourscript.py</code>!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KlausD. I am so new to python that I do not know what you mean when you say that. Do i type that in at the beginning of the code?</span>
