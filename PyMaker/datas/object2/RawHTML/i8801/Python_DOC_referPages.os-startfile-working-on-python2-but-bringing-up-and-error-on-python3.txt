<p>So I made a some quick code on Py2 which uses the os and time modules that opens a picture every 3 seconds 5 times in total and it works perfectly of Py2 but gives an error on Py3 which doesn't explain anything to me.</p>
<p>Error Here:</p>
<p>(unicode error) 'unicodeescape'codec can't decode bytes in position 2-3: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape</p>
<p>And here's the code:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import time

times = 5
count = 0

print("This program has started")

while(count &lt;= times):
    time.sleep(3)
    os.startfile("C:\Users\...\Picture.png")   # Truncated
    count += 1

else:
    print("Program has finished")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python 3 wants to treat the <code>\Uxxxx</code> sequence in <code>C:\Users</code> as a unicode character. It's always a good idea when dealing with Windows paths (and their backslashes) to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">raw strings</a>, which will treat the backslashes as normal characters:</p>
<pre><code>os.startfile(r"C:\Users\...\Picture.png")
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could escape the backslashes individually:</p>
<pre><code>os.startfile("C:\\Users\\...\\Picture.png")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This is all that comes up <a href="https://gyazo.com/88bdc0ef3daae9b34f4c25ee1151c2f5" rel="nofollow noreferrer">gyazo.com/88bdc0ef3daae9b34f4c25ee1151c2f5</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much, I'm pretty new to Python so didn't know about the raw strings thing. Hope you have a nice day :)</span>
