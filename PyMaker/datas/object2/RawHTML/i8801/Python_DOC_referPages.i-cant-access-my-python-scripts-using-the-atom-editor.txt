<p>Trying to execute 1.py and 2.py scripts which are saved in my .atom folder.</p>
<p>However when I copy exactly what my tutorial video types I get errors (shown in screenshot). Also the atom tutorial doesn't seem to work for me either.</p>
<p>Tried creating a 3.py file in the user1 directory so I could access directly but all I get is a quick flash of a pop up window and then nothing.</p>

<p>First, python should be in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#excursus-setting-environment-variables" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PATH</a>.</p>
<p>Then, inside powershell, if you're in "C:\Users\user1" you should be able to launch:</p>
<pre><code>python 3.py
</code></pre>
<p>and see something, as long as <code>3.py</code> exists and prints something.</p>
<p>One alternative would be to install <a href="https://atom.io/packages/script" rel="nofollow noreferrer">script package</a>. Then <code>CTRL+ALT+B</code> will launch the script directly. You'd still need to install python and have it in PATH.</p>
<p>If you still have problems, read this <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex0.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">page</a> (learnpythonthehardway.org) very carefully. Don't jump any step, and you should be fine.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What about <code>python 3.py</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The term '.\' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Che ck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again. At line:1 char:3 + .\ &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  .atom     + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (.\:String) [], CommandNotFoundException     + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException</span>
<span class="comment-copy">python 3.py gives similar error: The term 'python' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">1. from the picture one cannot see where <code>3.py</code> resides, it might not be in the user1 dir, 2. to execute python scripts you need to call the binary <code>python</code> or <code>python2</code> or <code>python3</code> if they are on the path (google environment variable path) or you need to call them from where they are (pseudo example: <code>C:\Program Files\PythonXYZ\bin\python3</code>)</span>
