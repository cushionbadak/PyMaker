<p>I am relatively new to Python an was using Youtube videos to study. I wrote a small script on my own as follows.</p>
<pre><code>def main()
    func1()
    func2()

def func1():
#defininition goes here

def func2():
#definition goes here


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>Only the <code>func1()</code> is executing. I want both of them to execute. Can someone please tell me how to do it.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I see you are missing a ":" after <code>def main()</code> </p>
<p>And it's executing both function for me when I put a print statement inside both functions.</p>
<pre><code>def main():        
    func1()
    func2()

def func1():
    #defininition goes here
    print "in func1"


def func2():
    #defininition goes here
    print "in func2"


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>The main method needs a <strong>:</strong> at the end to be completely/correctly declared</p>
<pre><code>def main():
</code></pre>
<p>after that everything will work fine :)</p>

<h1>Edit:</h1>
<p>from another file:</p>
<p>create the file  myExampleFuntion.py, then move func1 and func2 there, then in the original file import that doing <strong>import myExampleFuntion.py</strong></p>
<p>and call them </p>
<pre><code>myExampleFuntion.func1()

myExampleFuntion.func2()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">is there anything inside func1 or func2?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Both should be executed, paste here full code to get help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you think that only one function was invoke?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I never put functions in (running) scripts. I create a dedicated run.py file which I run, <i>or</i> I go to the command line -&gt; import the module -&gt;  call the functions I want manually.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Elmex80s Could you provide me a skeleton on how to do that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you. That was my mistake. Thanks once again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AnnaA : you did not accept my answer. Was that intentional? , just checking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry, accidently. I have one more question.  	 Is there any way in which I could place the declarations of these functions in a seperate .py file and call them from the main funciton?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AnnaA.: The tutorial covers this in the chapter about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Modules</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes absolutely. You can save your functions in separate .py file say func.py and call that file within your main function .py file say main.py.  Then in main.py you could call func.py as <code>from func import *</code> and still be able to access func's methods.  It will be better to go through a tutorial if this doesnt makes sense.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. Is there any way in which I could place the declarations of these functions in a seperate .py file and call them from the main funciton?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you are welcome... yes for sure... create the py file or even better a class</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ ΦXocę 웃 Пepeúpa ツ Could you provide me with a skeleton on how to do it? i am mostly used to C++ and doing python for the first time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AnnaA. the xkeleton example is there for you....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. Just realised it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. Is there any way in which I could place the declarations of these functions in a seperate .py file and call them from the main funciton?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you can create different .py files, then you can import  for example:  import func1 import func2  def main():     func1.func1()     func2.func2()</span>
