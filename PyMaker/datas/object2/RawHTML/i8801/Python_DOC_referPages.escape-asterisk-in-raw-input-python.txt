<p>Newbie here.
I'm would like to use raw_input() to select a file that ends in .raw from the directory. How do I pass the * as a literal to python? Thank you.</p>
<pre><code>if len(fname) == 0:
    fname = '*.raw'
try:
    fname = open(fname)
except:
    print fname, ('File Not Found')
exit()
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It doesn't work like that â€“ shell wildcards are a different beast.</p>
<p>You need to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>glob.glob()</code></a> or similar to expand a wildcard pattern.</p>
<pre><code>pattern = raw_input('Enter filename or pattern')
files = glob.glob(pattern)
if not files:
     print('No matching files.')
open(files[0]) # ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't do that. The shell does the globbing, so you need a way to simulate that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, format your code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it seems  like you're looking for <code>glob.glob()</code> but it's not really clear; your code snipped dosen't include <code>raw_input()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, what do you expect to happen here if the glob pattern matches multiple files?</span>
