<p>I'm new to Python and really want this command to work so I have been looking around on google but I still can't find any solution. I'm trying to make a script that deletes a folder inside the folder my Blender game are inside so i have been trying out those commands:</p>
<pre><code>import shutil
from bge import logic
path = bge.logic.expandPath("//")

shutil.rmtree.path+("/killme")  # remove dir and all contains
</code></pre>
<p>The Folder i want to delete is called "killme" and I know you can just do: <code>shutil.rmtree(Path)</code></p>
<p>but I want the path to start at the folder that the game is in and not the full C:/programs/blabla/blabla/test/killme path.</p>
<p>Happy if someone could explain.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you are using shutil.rmtree command in wrong way. You may use the following.</p>
<p><code>shutil.rmtree(path+"/killme")</code></p>
<p>Look at the reference <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.rmtree" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.rmtree</a>
<br/>Syntax: shutil.rmtree(path, ignore_errors=False, onerror=None)
<br/>Assuming that your current project directory is 'test'. Then, your code will look like the follwing:</p>
<pre><code>import shutil
from bge import logic
path = os.getcwd() # C:/programs/blabla/blabla/test/
shutil.rmtree(path+"/killme")  # remove dir and all contains
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><br/>NOTE: It will fail if the files are read only in the folder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope it helps!</p>

<p>What you could do is set a base path like </p>
<pre><code>basePath = "/bla_bla/"
</code></pre>
<p>and then append the path and use something like:</p>
<pre><code>shutil.rmtree(basePath+yourGamePath)
</code></pre>
<p>If you are executing the python as a standalone script that is inside the desired folder, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env_python
import os
cwd = os.getcwd()
shutil.rmtree(cwd) 
</code></pre>
<p>Hope my answer was helpful</p>

<p>The best thing you could do is use the <strong>os</strong> library. </p>
<p>Then with the os.path function you can list all the directories and filenames and hence can delete/modify the required folders while extractring the name of folders in the same way you want. </p>
<pre><code>for root, dirnames, files in os.walk("issues"):
        for name in dirnames:
           for filename in files:
              *what you want*
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Solved, thanks alot! ^-^</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for all the support guys, I have tried almost everything you have said but sadly I keep getting this error <code>Python script failed, look in the console for now...</code> what I have tried is: <code>import shutil from bge import logic basePath = "/test/" shutil.rmtree(basePath+"/killme")</code> and <code>import os cwd = os.getcwd("/test/") shutil.rmtree(cwd)</code> and import shutil from bge import logic path = os.getcwd("/test/") # C:/programs/blabla/blabla/test/ shutil.rmtree(path+"/killme")` but the error keeps apearing. The console doesn't say.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh I just checked my console and on every error it tells "No module named "bge"." So I think the script is not the problem, it is the (import bge) that doesn't work. Gonna check that up! ^-^</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, then you should probably install that module first. Let us know if the error persists.</span>
