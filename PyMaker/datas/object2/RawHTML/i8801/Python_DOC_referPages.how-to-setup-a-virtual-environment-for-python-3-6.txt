<span class="comment-copy">What it is that you think is different? Did you stumble upon a problem doing that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I was not able to install virtual wrapper using pip install. It was giving an error. I was wondering if it had anything to do with the version now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Post the execution log please</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I had seen in one of the website the need to use virtual wrapper. However, the pip installation for that for Python 3.6 was not working. However, from you documentation I came to learn that, it is not required. Thank you.</span>
