<p>python-2.x has a list of <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#non-essential-built-in-funcs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">non-essential built in functions</a> but python-3.x has no such list, and clearly there are <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built in functions in python-2.x</a> that are no longer in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python-3.x</a>.  Is there a list somewhere of all the python-2.x built in functions that were removed in python-3.x?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#builtins" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The list of removed built-ins in 3.0 can be found here.</a></p>
<p>There are a few functions that were renamed:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>intern()</code> was moved to <code>sys.intern()</code>.</li>
<li><code>raw_input()</code> was renamed to just <code>input()</code>. The old behaviour can be emulated by using <code>eval(input())</code>.</li>
<li><code>reduce()</code> was moved to <code>functools.reduce()</code>.</li>
<li><code>reload()</code> was moved to <code>imp.reload()</code> in 3.0, and subsequently moved to <code>importlib.reload</code> in 3.4.</li>
<li><code>xrange()</code> was renamed to <code>range()</code>, replacing the old <code>range()</code> builtin.</li>
</ul>
<p>And one function resurrected:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>callable()</code>, which was removed in 3.0 and resurrected in 3.2.</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">Couple omissions from "renamed" list: <code>reduce</code> -&gt; <code>functools.reduce</code>, and a multistep rename, <code>reload</code> -&gt; <code>imp.reload</code> (3.0+, deprecated in 3.4) -&gt; <code>importlib.reload</code> (3.4+). Few people used the former, but the latter is commonly used in interactive sessions during development, I usually tweak my <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> file (executed only for interactive sessions) to automatically do <code>from importlib import reload</code> so I can use it without explicitly importing or qualifying it.</span>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>xrange()</code> to <code>range()</code> is another significant one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!  This is what I was looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note: Py3's <code>range</code> is better than Py2's <code>xrange</code>. For one, from the start, it had no value or size limits; <code>xrange</code> couldn't produce values outside the range of a C <code>ssize_t</code>, and couldn't have a total number of items greater than <code>SSIZE_MAX</code>. Py3.0 <code>range</code> has no such limits (though you can't take the <code>len</code> if it exceeds <code>SSIZE_MAX</code>), and in later 3.x releases they made other improvements, like <code>O(1)</code> membership testing and logical equality testing, support for slicing, etc.</span>
