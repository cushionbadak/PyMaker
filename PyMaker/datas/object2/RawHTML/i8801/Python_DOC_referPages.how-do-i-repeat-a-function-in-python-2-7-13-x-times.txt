<p>I am very new to Python coding. My code asks the user for an integer input. How do I get a function to repeat the number of times the user inputs? I would also like to know how I would get the function to repeat a random number of times within a certain range without user intervention.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You would want to use for-loops. Import random and use randint(0,x) for example to get your random number, then loop for that num of times.</p>
<pre><code>    import random
    def my_function():
        x = raw_input()

    times = random.randint(1,9)
    for i in range(times):
        my_function()
</code></pre>
