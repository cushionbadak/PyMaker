<p>When I use the operator <code>in</code> to compare strings in my program it works great but if I call it in a module I created it doesn't seem to work. I know I am making some error but not certain what it is, can anyone help?</p>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<p>Module:</p>
<pre><code>def checkRoots(wordChecked, rootList):
    numRoots = len(rootList);
    numTypeRoots = createList(numRoots);
    for z in range(0, numRoots):
        root = rootList[z];
        rootThere = root in word;
        if rootThere == True:
            numTypeRoots[z] = numTypeRoots[z] + 1;
    return numTypeRoots;
</code></pre>
<p>code works though when not in module as shown here:</p>
<pre><code>for y in range (0, numRoots):
    root = roots[y];
    rootThere = root in word;
    if rootThere == True:
        numTypeRoots[y] = numTypeRoots[y] + 1;
</code></pre>
<p>Basic program takes a list of words in from a file and then looks to see if a particular root is in the word.  </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The function is doing <code>root in word</code> but I think what you actually want to do is <code>root in wordChecked</code></p>
<p>Global variables are the devil. best to avoid them if you can help it.</p>
<p>Suggestion - if writing Python code that other people might look at ( hint: probably any/all code) it's a good idea to read through and follow <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="PEP-8">PEP-8</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you elaborate on "it doesn't seem to work"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"My code doesn't work" <b>is not an adequate problem statement</b></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>word</code>? You don't need those semicolons. And <code>if root in word: ...</code> reads better.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're going to make your programming and SO-asking life much easier if you write functions that operate entirely on parameters explicitly passed to them and provide complete examples when you run into problems. Take a look at how to write a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unless whatever is returned by <code>createList</code> is <i>really</i> special, you could replace it very easily with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a>, which exists to do exactly what you're doing here.  A plain old <code>dict</code> would work, too.</span>
