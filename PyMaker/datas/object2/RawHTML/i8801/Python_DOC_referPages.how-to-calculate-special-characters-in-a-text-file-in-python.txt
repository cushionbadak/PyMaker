<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to calculate the number of non-alphanumeric characters in a text file, so that I can use that count as a feature in my feature set for text classification.
Any help would be greatly helpful.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can simply iterate over the file and use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalnum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.isalnum()</code></a> method to count the number of non-alphanumerical characters.</p>
<p>So something like:</p>
<pre><code>count_special = 0
with open(filename,mode='r') as f:
    for line in f:
        count_special += sum(not x.isalnum() for x in line)
print(count_special)
</code></pre>
<p>So after the loop, the <code>count_special</code> contains the total number of non-alphanumerical characters.</p>
<p>By parsing one line at a time, this method will usually be able to process large text files, since it does not have to load the entire file into memory first.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use this way. You have to define list of special characters as <code>regex</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import re
x = re.compile("[^A-Za-z0-9]") 
# also you can use "[^\w]" or "[\W]" patterns
</code></pre>
<p>And find number of special characters as a length of <code>re.findall</code>:</p>
<pre><code>s = ", : ; \" ' ? / &gt; &lt; { [ ) * &amp; \n"
print len(re.findall(x, s))
29
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This function will return the number of non alpha numeric chacacters in a file:</p>
<pre><code>def count_non_alphanumeric(filename):
    with open(filename, "r") as f: #open the file as f
        nonalpha_count=0           # this is the running count of alphanumeric chars
        for line in f: #for each line in the file...
            for ch in line:  #for each character in the line...
                if not ch.isalnum():  # check to see if the character is alphanumeric
                    nonalpha_count+=1
    return nonalpha_count
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use string method "isalnum" (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalnum" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalnum</a>) which return False if string contain non-alphanumeric characters.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "Egg".isalnum()
&gt;&gt;&gt; True
&gt;&gt;&gt; "[".isalnum()
&gt;&gt;&gt; False
&gt;&gt;&gt; "-Spam-".isalnum()
&gt;&gt;&gt; False
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What are special characters? Give a definition, pls.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">characters like , : ; " ' ? / &gt; &lt; { [ ) * &amp;</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you say "characters like <code>, : ; " ' ? / &gt; &lt; { [ ) * &amp;</code> ", do you mean exactly that set of characters, or some broader set of characters we're supposed to deduce from those examples?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">All characters except alphabets and numeric.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kapil: are new lines (<code>'\n'</code>) also considered special characters? What about spaces, tabs,...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Willem :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The specifications have changed meanwhile...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@WillemVanOnsem thanks, I see )</span>
