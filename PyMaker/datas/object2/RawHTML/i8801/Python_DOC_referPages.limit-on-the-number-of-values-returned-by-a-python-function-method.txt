<p>I was working with some code and realised that things became a lot easier when a single method was returning 4 values. Working with traditional languages like C++ and Java where methods return only a single value, I came to wonder</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a limit on the number of values returned by a Python function?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stuff like this works effortlessly. Is there a limit to it?</p>
<pre><code>def hello():
    return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

a, b, c, d, e = hello()
print a, b, c, d, e
</code></pre>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Stragely enough, I didn't find any answer to this question</p>

<p>If you return multiple values, you actually <strong>return a tuple</strong>. Indeed:</p>
<pre><code>return 1,4,2,5
</code></pre>
<p>is short for:</p>
<pre><code>return (1,4,2,5)
</code></pre>
<p>So the question boils down to <strong>how many items a tuple can carry</strong>. The answer can be obtained with:</p>
<pre><code>import sys

<b><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.maxsize" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sys.maxsize</a></b></code></pre>
<p>It is usually 2<sup>31</sup>-1=2 147 483 647 on a 32-bit system and 2<sup>63</sup>-1=9 223 372 036 854 775 807 on a 64-bit system. The strange thing is: it is not 2<sup>32</sup>-1 (or 2<sup>64</sup>-1) so that means that technically speaking if you have a 32-bit machine, and your have 4 GiB in place, the list <em>itself</em> can only fill up half of the memory (of course the elements in the list can be responsible to fill up the remaining half).</p>
<p>Of course the elements also need to fit into memory: if you have no space left to store five million elements, your program will crash anyway.</p>

<p>Python functions only return a single value: a reference to an object. That object may be of any type, including a tuple (which is what's constructed with <code>return 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</code>). The size of the object is only limited by your computer's available memory.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I came to realise just this. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah you're right. This works <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = (1, 2, 3) &gt;&gt;&gt; a, b, c = x &gt;&gt;&gt; print a, b, c</code></span>
