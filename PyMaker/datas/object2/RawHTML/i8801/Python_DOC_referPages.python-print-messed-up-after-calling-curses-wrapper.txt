<p>I am having a problem with curses library in Python. Consider the following code:</p>
<pre><code>def main(stdscr):

    print('Hello World!!')
    create_screen()
    curses.endwin()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    curses.wrapper(main)
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is every text printed by "print" function is messed up even before calling "create_screen()" function which initiates the screen by "curses.initscr()" </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>print</code> and <code>input</code> normally before and after your program uses <code>curses</code>. Also, you do not have to put all your code into <code>main</code>, and you don't have to pass the <code>main</code> function to <code>curses</code>, either. <code>main</code> is just a function like any other. Check out this simple example:</p>
<pre><code>import curses, time

def incurses(stdscr):
    stdscr.addstr(0, 0, "Exiting in ")
    stdscr.addstr(2, 0, "Hello World from Curses!")
    for i in range(5, -1, -1):
        stdscr.addstr(0, 11, str(i))
        stdscr.refresh()
        time.sleep(1)
    curses.endwin()

def main():
    print('Hello World!!')
    choice = input("Start Curses Program? ")
    if choice == "yes":
        curses.wrapper(incurses)
    print("After curses")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>This prints and asks for user input, then shows a curses screen, then goes back into "normal" printing mode.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Then do not print anything... you're using curses for a reason.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What exactly do you want to achieve? Why can't you use <code>curses</code> for those "normal" calls to <code>print</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AnttiHaapala I need to print some stuff before calling main program screen by curses, like, banner and user input</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tobias_k I am trying to get a user input which will specify if I will invoke program main screen by curses or not, in addition to that i am printing program banner</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What happens if you do those <code>print</code> and <code>input</code> <i>before</i> calling <code>curses.wrapper</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much @tobias_k  that is the problem with over thinking :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>curses.endwin()</code> is not required as <code>curses.wrapper</code> does it automatically. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html#starting-and-ending-a-curses-application" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/howto/â€¦</a></span>
