<p>I want to take an input from someone and save it in a dictionary even after I end the program so that I can run it again and retrieve the information. How do I do this?</p>

<p>You need to save the information to a file or database when the program ends and reload it when it starts. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pickle</a> is one way you can do that.</p>
