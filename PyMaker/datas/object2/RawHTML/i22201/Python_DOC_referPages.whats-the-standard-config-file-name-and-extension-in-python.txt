<p>I'm creating a config file to hold configuration/properties settings for my project that frequently change, such as file paths. What's the standard name/extension for such a file? (e.g. in Java I've used config.xml, in VB.NET I've used App.config...)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First, consider using ConfigParser (configparser in 3.0, so the documentation says).  That doesn't solve the naming problem, but it is a readable alternative to xml for most configuration needs.</p>
<p>Whatever name you use, make all the parts meaningful. I would probably use something like appName.cfg, where appName identifies your application, or the part of the application the configuration is for.</p>

<p>Ok, I've asked around where I work and researched a little, and this is what I've come up with as suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>settings.ini</li>
<li>applicationName.config</li>
<li>applicationName.cfg</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone has any other suggestions, feel free to add...</p>

<p>The docs seem to use <code>.cfg</code></p>
<p>On Windows, many people (such as mercurial) use <code>.ini</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I am planning on using ConfigParser, was just wondering if there are any accepted or widely used naming conventions for the file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">configparser docs</a> for Python 3 now use <code>.ini</code> in all examples except the "Legacy API Examples" (which use <code>.cfg</code>)</span>
