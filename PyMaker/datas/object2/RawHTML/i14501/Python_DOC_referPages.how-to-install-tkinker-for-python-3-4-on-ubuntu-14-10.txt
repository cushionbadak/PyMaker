<p>I'm a beginner to Python.
I'm using <strong>Python 3.4</strong> on my <strong>Ubuntu 14.10</strong>.
I wanted to install <strong>tkinter</strong> on to my <strong>PyCharm IDE</strong>.
I did some research and found out that there are two different names for it on Python2 and Python3, Tkinter and tkinter respectively.
So, I wanted to know how to install it for Python 3.4 on Ubuntu.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try these methods</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get build-dep python3-tk
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
</code></pre>
<p>if it hasn't been worked tell me</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't have to install it, it's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">part of the standard library</a>; just <code>import tkinter</code>. Or are you trying to say that you've tried that and failed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Autofill in PyCharm IDE says that there is no module called tkinter, it shows only _tkinter for Python 3.4. Still it says - <code>ImportError: No module named 'Tkinter'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">second one is enough, tried yesterday and it works fine</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i know that it is enough but probably he may need it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I got this error for first one. <code>E: Build-dependencies for python3-tk could not be satisfied.</code> The second one says <code>python3-tk is already the newest version.</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then you can use it easly in your programs by <code>import tkinter</code>  in the program</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, I cant, PyCharm shows no module named tkinter, only a module named _tkinter.</span>
