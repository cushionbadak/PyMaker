<p>I have a for loop that iterates over a number and performs some simple calculations.  I am trying to figure out how to print out ( or log to file) the current value of 'val' every .5 to 1 second with out having to pause or sleep during the loop.  Here is a super simple example</p>
<pre><code>val_list = []

for i in xrange(iterations):
    val = (i*(1/2)) * pi
    val2 = np.linalg.pinv(val)
    # print or write to log val2 after every half second (or 1 second)
    val_list.append(val2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just use <code>time.time</code> to capture the time before starting, then check how long it's been after you calculate val2:</p>
<pre><code>import time

val_list = []

prev_time = time.time()

for i in xrange(iterations):
    val = (i*(1/2)) * pi
    val2 = np.linalg.pinv(val)
    # print or write to log val2 after every half second (or 1 second)
    dt = time.time() - prev_time
    if dt &gt; 1:
        # print or write to log here
        prev_time = time.time()    
    val_list.append(val2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>time.time()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from time import time as t
val_list = []
nowTime = t()
for i in xrange(iterations):
    val = (i*(1/2)) * pi
    val2 = np.linalg.pinv(val)
    curTime = t()
    if curTime - nowTime &gt;= 0.5:
        #Do your stuff
        nowTime = curTime
    val_list.append(val2)
</code></pre>

<p>You can achieve this using Threads.</p>
<p>Here's a documentation on how to utilize Threads : <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html</a> ( If you're using Python2.7 then change the 3 in the url to a 2 )</p>
<p>Here's a link which is similar to what you want and should also point you in the right direction : <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12435211/python-threading-timer-repeat-function-every-n-seconds">Python threading.timer - repeat function every 'n' seconds</a></p>
<p>Basically you have to create a Thread that will only execute ever n number of seconds. On each iteration it will print the value. The above link should suffice for that. Good luck !</p>

<span class="comment-copy">beat me by 5 seconds!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use time.sleep() also.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3653796 the OP said he can't sleep or pause.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Same as above, this works for what I need to do.  Thank you for the assistance!</span>
