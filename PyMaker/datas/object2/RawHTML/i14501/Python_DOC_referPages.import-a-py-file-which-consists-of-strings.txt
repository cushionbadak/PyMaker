<p>I have 2 files for my python project.
One file is the main file and the other consists only of strings I wish to use in the first main file.</p>
<p>The strings .py file consist of:</p>
<pre><code>string = "hey"
string_two = "bye"
</code></pre>
<p>in the main .py file, I have tried to call this file using the import function and then print the string:</p>
<pre><code>import strings

print string
</code></pre>
<p>I got this error from console:</p>
<pre><code>NameError: name 'string' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>Why is this happening? shouldn't it work because I have imported the file to the main.py file?
What am I doing wrong?</p>
</div>

<p>I would advise you to use a name other than 'string' as that is already the name of system library in Python. Try the following:</p>
<p>my_strings.py</p>
<pre><code>string_one = "hey"
string_two = "bye"
</code></pre>
<p>main.py</p>
<pre><code>import my_strings

print my_strings.string_one
</code></pre>
<p>If you wanted to just import specific strings, you could do this in main.py</p>
<pre><code>from my_strings import string_one
print string_one
</code></pre>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>normally you would</p>
<pre><code>import strings
print(strings.string)
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>from strings import string
print(string)
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT see comment - there are issues with this, though for some modules such as tkinter it is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html" rel="nofollow">recommended way</a>. (If you are simply moving some of your code into a subsidiary file for tidiness then doing this isn't an unreasonable approach)</p>
<pre><code>from strings import *
print(string)
</code></pre>
<p>i.e. without the .py</p>
<p>this is a bad name for a file and a variable though.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hey, I actually import without using '.py' (fixed it in the question now). Moreover, the variable name is just for this example :]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please don't recommend <code>import *</code>.</span>
