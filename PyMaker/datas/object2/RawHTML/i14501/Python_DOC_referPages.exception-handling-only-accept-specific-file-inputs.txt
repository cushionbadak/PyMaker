<p>This is a bit above my pay grade, so I thought I would ask on here. </p>
<p>My simple Python code prompts the user to enter the name of a file. However, it must be a specific type of file, or else I would like to throw an error. In this case, the files entered must be a text or CSV file, i.e. filename extensions must be <code>.txt</code> or <code>.csv</code></p>
<pre><code>filename = raw_input("Please enter .txt or .csv file: ")
</code></pre>
<p>I have no idea how to test for that. You begin with something like</p>
<pre><code>def fileName():
   while True:
       try: 
           filename = raw_input("Please enter .txt or .csv file: ")
</code></pre>
<p>and then use an if statement check whether the last four characters are <code>.txt</code> or <code>.csv</code>. </p>
<p>What is the standard way to do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to keep asking until the user enters a filename with the correct extension using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.endswith" rel="nofollow">str.endswith</a>:</p>
<pre><code>def fileName():
   while True:
       filename = raw_input("Please enter .txt or .csv file: ")
       if filename.endswith((".csv",".txt"))
          return filename
       else:
            print("Extension must be .csv or .txt")
</code></pre>
<p>If you actually want to just verify the input and raise an error on bad input:</p>
<pre><code>   def fileName():
       filename = raw_input("Please enter .txt or .csv file: ")
       if filename.endswith((".csv",".txt")):
           return filename
       raise ValueError("Extension must be .csv or .txt")
</code></pre>
<p>You don't need a try/except to check the last four  characters are either <code>.txt</code> or <code>.csv</code> but just because the filename may end with the correct extension does not mean it is a valid file or won't cause an error when opening, you should worry about catching exceptions when and if you actually open the file.</p>

<p>Python has great resources for doing all sorts of path manipulations. This is a good time to go ahead and get familiar with them. </p>
<p>See the documentation for <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html" rel="nofollow">os.path</a> and specifically, for <code>os.path.splitext(path)</code> 
which returns a pair (root, ext) so you can test the ext (extension) value.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't think you want a <code>try</code> here. If you want to raise an exception, you don't to immediately catch the same exception, or what's the point? (But if you <i>do</i> want a <code>try</code>, then you need at least one <code>except</code> or a <code>finally</code>. If you can't think of what you'd want to put thereâ€¦ then you shouldn't have a <code>try</code>.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Whoah! I never knew python has a "endswith()" string method! For others checking out this post, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html</a> Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JesseTrevve, no worries, you're welcome. You can pass a single string or a tuple of strings to check against.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Another quick question: How can I use the file I've entered into my code? Previously, I was using <code>filename</code>, but now it throws an error. Surely <code>filename = raw_input()</code> should define that value throughout the code, even if it is in a function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to use the filename returned fron the function</span>
