<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to get the formatting right on my print-out and it's trickier than it should be. My objective is to have my code read in a dictionary, turn it to a list, sort it, then print it back out a text file looking like</p>
<p>"String" "Float"</p>
<p>"String" "Float" </p>
<p>"String" "Float"  </p>
<p>When instead it prints</p>
<p>string</p>
<p>float</p>
<p>string </p>
<p>float</p>
<p>Looking at the raw data that is my dictionary it looks like: </p>
<pre><code>{'blahblah\n': 0.3033367037411527, 'barfbarf\n': 0.9703779366700716, 
</code></pre>
<p>I suspect the \n newline command has something to do with this. But I can't seem to mitigate it. My code is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>#Open the text file and read it back it
h = open('File1.txt', 'r')
my_dict = eval(h.read())

#Print out the dictionary
print "Now tidying up the data......"
z = my_dict

#Turn the dictionary into a list and print it
j = open('File2.txt', 'w')
z = z.items()
z.sort(key=lambda t:t[1])
z.reverse()
for user in z:
    print &gt;&gt; j, user[0], user[1]
j.close()
</code></pre>
<p>This code works perfectly in just about every other part of my program. For some reason it's having issues here. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>\n</code> is a newline character. Written to a file it shows as a line break. You should remove it before printing out:</p>
<pre><code>print &gt;&gt; j, user[0].strip(), user[1].strip()
</code></pre>
<p>Or even better, do it while turning to a list:</p>
<pre><code>z = [item.strip() for item in z.items()]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The <code>\n</code> certainly has something to do with it!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks like I only need the .strip() on the string and not the float. Thanks for the answer!</span>
