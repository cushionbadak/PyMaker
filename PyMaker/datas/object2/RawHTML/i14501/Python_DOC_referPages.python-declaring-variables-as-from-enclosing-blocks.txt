<p>What is the Python idiom for something like:</p>
<pre><code>def F():
    waitfor = 5
    def f2(x):
        global2you waitfor # &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; SOMETHING FROM ENCLOSING_BLOCKS
        waitfor += 1
        return waitfor
    print "waitfor, before", waitfor, "and after", f2("ABCD")
F()
</code></pre>
<p>I am reluctant to use <code>global waitfor</code> because I don't want to have any name collisions with other developers' variable names. I am stuck with Python 2.6.9. Thanks.</p>

<p>In Python 3, you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal" rel="nofollow"><code>nonlocal</code></a> keyword, which solves this problem cleanly.</p>
<p>In Python 2, however, you have to resort to a "poor man's reference", by turning <code>waitfor</code> into a list of one element:</p>
<pre><code>def F():
    waitfor = [5]
    def f2(x):
        waitfor[0] += 1
        return waitfor[0]
    print "waitfor, before", waitfor[0], "and after", f2("ABCD")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">An observation: if you are returning the value of <code>waitfor</code>, do you really need to update the variable defined in <code>F</code>?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, this will do. And in 2 minutes SO will also allow me to mark this as accepted :))</span>
