<p>One of the Computer in Eastern TimeZone has set a daylight option.
It's time.daylight value shown to me is 69. 
Yes, daylight is defined, time.localtime().tm_dst is returning correct to 1.</p>
<p>When I check time.daylight python docs, it only mentioned that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>time.daylight</code> 
  Nonzero if a DST timezone is defined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have tried changing time with almost every time zone in the list. But 
always I got value of time.daylight to 1 only.</p>
<p>Is there any way to produce time.daylight value to greater than 1 ?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated ?</p>

<p>Not sure what are you looking for. As the docs say <code>time.daylight</code> just indicates whether the system has some DST timezone configured or not, so it’s just a “yes”/“no” value. What do you expect to it to be if it is greater than <code>1</code>?</p>
<p>Are you looking for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.altzone" rel="nofollow"><code>time.altzone</code></a> which contains the offset of DST in case one is defined?</p>

<p>It is strange that it uses an integer and not just a True / False boolean, but it does appear to just be a flag. Check <code>help(time)</code> and you'll see:</p>
<pre><code>daylight -- whether local time should reflect DST
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know where the 69 is coming from, but I think you should just take it to mean non-zero. As kirelagin suggests, you should us time.altzone to find the DST offset.</p>
<p>Because you're only supposed to use time.altzone if time.daylight is nonzero, you could use one of the following to get the DST offset in hours:</p>
<pre><code>dst_offset = time.daylight and time.altzone/60/60
dst_offset = time.altzone/60/60 if time.daylight else 0
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure, time.daylight is yes/no only (i.e. 0/1 or 1+ ) because I didn't able to produce value other than 1 and .5.                                                                                                                  It also return .5 when time-zone supports half hour daylight saving. Basically It is 1 for those countries using 1 hour daylight saving time and .5 for those countries using half hour daylight saving time. So, the question was, I am getting time.daylight value to 69 on some computers in Easter Timezone those who enabled daylight, why so ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3016020 You quoted the doc yourself, it is either <i>zero</i> or <i>nonzero</i>. Just two options: yes or no. Nothing else is guaranteed. The exact value probably depends on the OS and some other details, but its meaning is undefined.</span>
