<pre><code>wow = ["wowza this is a really long string wows"]

if "long"  or "is" in wow:
    print("yes")
</code></pre>
<p>output is <code>yes</code></p>
<p>however if I put in </p>
<pre><code>wow = ["wowza this is a really long string wows"]

if "long" in wow:
print("yes")
</code></pre>
<p>output is <code>nothing</code></p>
<p>same with:</p>
<pre><code> wow = ["wowza this is a really long string wows"]

    if "is" in wow:
    print("yes")
</code></pre>
<p>why?</p>
<p>I thought <code>or</code> was supposed to be either one?
but if individually inputed both are false but with <code>or</code> it becomes true?</p>
<p>or that's the wrong way to write an <code>if or statement?</code></p>
<p>should it be written like this?</p>
<pre><code>if "long" in wow or "is" in wow:
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>if "long"  or "is" in wow:
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>if ("long")  or ("is" in wow):
</code></pre>
<p>What you want is:</p>
<pre><code>if "long" in wow or "is" in wow:
</code></pre>
<p>The first test is successful, because <code>"long"  or "is" in wow</code> returns <code>"long"</code> and the string <code>"long"</code> is truthy*. The following tests fail, because <code>wow</code> is a list with 1 string, and the <code>in</code> operator tests for list containment here, instead of string containment.</p>
<p>*the <code>or "is" in wow</code> part would not get tested here, because the if short-circuits. Has nothing to do with your problem though</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>OK, we have several different problems here.</p>
<pre><code>if "long"  or "is" in wow:
</code></pre>
<p>That means this:</p>
<pre><code>if ("long")  or ("is" in wow):
</code></pre>
<p>So yes, you need to change it to this:</p>
<pre><code>if "long" in wow or "is" in wow:
</code></pre>
<p>But that still doesn't do what you want, because <code>wow</code> is a list.  You're asking whether <code>"long"</code> is an element of that list.  But <code>"long"</code> isn't an element of the list.  The only element of the list is the string <code>"wowza this is a really long string wows"</code>, which is not the same as <code>"long"</code>.  You want to check against the string itself, not the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>How about you send your condition to the interactive prompt (run python or ipython if you have it) to see what it returns?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; wow = ["wowza this is a really long string wows"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; "long" in wow
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; "long" or "is" in wow
'long'
</code></pre>
<p>You probably want to test the string, not a single item list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; wow = wow[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; "long" in wow
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; "long" or "is" in wow
'long'
&gt;&gt;&gt; ("long" or "is") in wow
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; wow
'wowza this is a really long string wows'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>'long'</code> is <code>True</code> and thus the expression will always be <code>True</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This question has been asked so many hundreds of times. Why do people keep writing new answers to it instead of just marking it a dup?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert Reputation try-hards.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MalikBrahimi: Don't you lose the rep once the question is closed? (I'm actually not sure about that; I've never bothered to go search on meta, but I always assumed there was no rep gain or loss for answering good duplicates, garbage questions, or anything else that's going to be closed.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you. I got confused with these or statements</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I thought <code>if "long"  or "is" in wow:</code> was returning true because we are checking <code>if "long"  or "is"</code> which is True.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Scott the <code>in</code> operator has higher priority than the <code>or</code> operator. <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Operator precedence</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Felk <code>in</code> over <code>or</code> thanks for educating me.  So the first line then is really doing <code>'is' in wow</code> which is False, then <code>if 'long' or False:...</code> which is True.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you. I got it all cleared now. Yes I should've checked it against the string itself not the list. thank you again very much</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for that. It's just the or operator I was confused at.  and yes I should've used a string instead of a list. thank you. I needed some clarification. thank you very much for taking the time to educate everyone</span>
