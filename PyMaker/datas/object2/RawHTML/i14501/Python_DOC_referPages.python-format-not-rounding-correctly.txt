<p>I have these two lists:</p>
<pre><code>salePrices = [9.95, 14.95, 19.95, 24.95, 29.95, 34.95, 39.95, 44.95, 49.95]
percents = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]
</code></pre>
<p>And then, using this for loop, I iterate through each percent and calculate the discounted price.</p>
<pre><code>for percent in percents:

    for salePrice in salePrices: 
        newPrice = salePrice - ((percent / 100) * salePrice) 
        print("\t" + "{0:.2f}".format(newPrice), end = " ") 
    print()
</code></pre>
<p>This all works fine, except for one issue: some of the values calculated are not rounded properly. </p>
<p>For instance, 14.95 - (0.1 * 14.95) = 13.455, which should be rounded to 13.46 by .format(). However, the value printed is 13.45.</p>
<p>Is there something I am doing wrong, or is it a problem with the method, format, itself?</p>

<p>Here's your problem:</p>
<pre><code>14.95 - (0.1 * 14.95) = 13.455
</code></pre>
<p>No, in IEEE doubles, <code>14.95 - (0.1 * 14.95)</code> is <code>13.454999999999998</code>. Which rounds down to <code>13.45</code> correctly.</p>

<p>If you want <code>14.95</code> to actually be exactly 14.95, rather than the closest binary fraction to 14.95, you may want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Decimal</code></a> instead of <code>float</code>. Of course <code>Decimal</code> is just as inexact, but the closest decimal fraction to 14.95 obviously really is 14.95. :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Tried rounding before .format?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sweet, thanks for that :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">SO questioners == computer scientists. lol</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Barmar: Hey, the paper was written back when anyone who wasn't a computer scientist didn't have access to a computer with an FPU. :)</span>
