<p>How can I read a <code>.txt</code> file in python and write those contents into a <code>.md</code> file without any change in content. I have googled enough but couldn't find a proper answer . ?</p>

<p>If you're not changing the contents you could just change the file extension. See this SO answer for help</p>

If you want to make a copy this is the simplest way I believe</p>
<pre><code>import shutil
shutil.copyfile("testcopy.txt", "testcopy.md")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Just to make it clear, you literally mean "the exact same bytes as a <code>.md</code> file instead of a <code>.txt</code> file", right? If so, then it's a dup. Probably of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/123198/how-do-i-copy-a-file-in-python">How do I copy a file in Python</a>, which has a variety of great answers with all the info you could ever want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">â€¦ except that you might also want to know about <code>os.path.splitext</code> to help you convert <code>"spam.txt"</code> to <code>"spam.md"</code> if that <code>"spam.txt"</code> is a value in a variable rather than a constant in your source.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks ! I have enough resource now .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was still wondering, if writing to a <code>.md</code> file directly is possible ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want to write the contents to another file . Is there a way in python to make a copy of this file and then change its extension !?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@saru95: Sure. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shutil</code></a> module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah ! thanks .</span>
