<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to remove specific characters from items in a list, using another list as a reference. Currently I have:</p>
<pre><code>forbiddenList = ["a", "i"]
tempList = ["this", "is", "a", "test"]
sentenceList = [s.replace(items.forbiddenList, '') for s in tempList]
print(sentenceList)
</code></pre>
<p>which I hoped would print:</p>
<pre><code>["ths", "s", "test"]
</code></pre>
<p>of course, the forbidden list is quite small and I could replace each individually, but I would like to know how to do this "properly" for when I have an extensive list of "forbidden" items.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use a nested list comprehension.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [''.join(j for j in i if j not in forbiddenList) for i in tempList]
['ths', 's', '', 'test']
</code></pre>
<p>It seems like you also want to remove elements if they become empty (as in, all of their characters were in <code>forbiddenList</code>)? If so, you can wrap the whole thing in even another list comp (at the expense of readability)</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [s for s in [''.join(j for j in i if j not in forbiddenList) for i in tempList] if s]
['ths', 's', 'test']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; templist = ['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']
&gt;&gt;&gt; forbiddenlist = ['a', 'i']
&gt;&gt;&gt; trans = str.maketrans('', '', ''.join(forbiddenlist))
&gt;&gt;&gt; [w for w in (w.translate(trans) for w in templist) if w]
['ths', 's', 'test']
</code></pre>
<p>This is a Python 3 solution using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.translate" rel="nofollow"><code>str.translate</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.maketrans" rel="nofollow"><code>str.maketrans</code></a>. It should be fast.</p>
<p>You can also do this in Python 2, but the interface for <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.translate" rel="nofollow"><code>str.translate</code></a> is slightly different:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; templist = ['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']
&gt;&gt;&gt; forbiddenlist = ['a', 'i']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [w for w in (w.translate(None, ''.join(forbiddenlist)) 
...         for w in templist) if w]
['ths', 's', 'test']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I like to do these things with a regex - regex's even have classes which are helpful - (e.g trying to remove all non printable chars)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">anyway this is a dup - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3939361/remove-specific-characters-from-a-string-in-python" title="remove specific characters from a string in python">stackoverflow.com/questions/3939361/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is neat and avoids "cheating" with regular expressions where pure list comprehension, as fully supported in python, works fine.</span>
