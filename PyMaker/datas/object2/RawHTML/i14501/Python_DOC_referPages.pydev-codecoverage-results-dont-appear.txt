<p>I have set up the codecoverage to run with pydev, but the results don't appear.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/297294/integrating-command-line-generated-python-coverage-files-with-pydev">this answer</a> I found the .coverage file at ~/.metadata/.plugins/org.python.pydev.debug/coverage, and that works properly (gives the result when running coverage report there, gets empty when I do it from pydev, etc).</p>
<p>Does somebody know where can I configure the path to get the results to the Eclipse plugin?</p>

<p>I just had the same problem and the solution was to install <em>coverage</em> from 3.x branch (i.e. <code>pip install "coverage &lt; 4.0.0"</code>). </p>
<p>There's a hint on <a href="http://www.pydev.org/manual_adv_coverage.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PyDev coverage documentation page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the integration is tested with version 3.4, so, this is the recommended version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coverage v4 has default report file name and its format changed. Older file name was <code>~/.metadata/.plugins/org.python.pydev.debug/coverage/.coverage</code> and it contained binary <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/marshal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>marshal</code></a>'ed output (according to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/297764/2072035">this answer</a>). Newer is in <code>~/.metadata/.plugins/org.python.pydev.debug/coverage/.coverage.0</code> and it contains JSON string prefixed with <em>!coverage.py: This is a private format, don't read it directly!</em> ;-)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hard to know what was wrong without more info... can you give the steps you're following which are not working? Are you following <a href="http://pydev.org/manual_adv_coverage.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pydev.org/manual_adv_coverage.html</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have installed the coveragy.py program with pydev following: <a href="http://pydev.org/manual_adv_coverage.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pydev.org/manual_adv_coverage.html</a> All steps work, except the reports at the report window, that don't appear.  But I know that the info is actually generated at the indicated directory.  I'm using Ubuntu 13.04 with eclipse Kepler Service Release 2 and pydev 3.5.0</span>
