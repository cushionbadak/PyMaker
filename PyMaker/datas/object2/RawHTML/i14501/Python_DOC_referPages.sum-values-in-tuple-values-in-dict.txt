<p>I have a dictionary <code>data</code> that looks like that with sample values:</p>
<pre><code>defaultdict(&lt;type 'list'&gt;, 
{(None, 2014): [(5, 1), (10, 2)], 
(u'Middle', 2014): [(6, 2), (11, 3)],
(u'SouthWest', 2015): [(7,3), (12, 4)]})
</code></pre>
<p>I get this from <code>collections.defaultdict(list)</code> because my keys have to be lists.</p>
<p>My goal is to get a new dictionary that will contain the sum values for every tuple with respect to their position in the tuple.</p>
<p>By running</p>
<pre><code>out = {k:(sum(tup[0] for tup in v),sum(tup[1] for tup in v)) for k,v in data.items()}
</code></pre>
<p>I get </p>
<pre><code>{(None, 2014): (15, 3),  (u'Middle', 2014): (17, 5), (u'SouthWest', 2015): (19, 7)}
</code></pre>
<p>However, I don't know in advance how many items will be in every tuple, so using the <code>sum(tup[0] for tup in v)</code> with hard-coded indices is not an option. I know, however, how many integers will be in the tuple. This value is an integer and I get this along with the <code>data</code> dict. All tuples are always of the same length (in this example, of length 2).</p>
<p>How do I tell Python that I want the <code>out</code> dict to contain tuple of the size that matches the length I have to use?</p>

<p>I think you want the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=zip#zip" rel="nofollow">built-in <code>zip</code> function</a>:</p>
<pre><code>In [26]: {k: tuple(sum(x) for x in zip(*v)) for k, v in data.items()}
Out[26]: 
{('SouthWest', 2015): (19, 7),
 (None, 2014): (15, 3),
 ('Middle', 2014): (17, 5)}
