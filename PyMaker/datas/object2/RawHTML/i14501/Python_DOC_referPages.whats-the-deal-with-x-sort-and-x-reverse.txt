<pre><code>x = [1, 3, 5, 7]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8]
x +=y
x.sort()
print(x.sort())
</code></pre>
<p>Every time I try to get an output for this python just returns none. Why is this? I also get the same result when I try to use x.reverse() and the like. 
Thank you!</p>

<p><code>x.sort()</code> sorts the list in place, it returns None, it just modifies the order of the list elements. The same goes for <code>x.reverse()</code></p>
<p>From the docs (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>The sort() and reverse() methods modify the list in place for economy of space when sorting or reversing a large list. To remind you that they operate by side effect, they don’t return the sorted or reversed list.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>These two list's functions should not be confused with more general built-in functions <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#sorted" rel="nofollow"><code>sorted()</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#reversed" rel="nofollow"><code>reversed()</code></a>. Which are functions (not method) and can be applied to different objects (not only lists) and return a new object.</p>
<p>Now to answer your question specifically, when you do: `print(x.sort()) you're saying "print the returns value of x.sort()" which is None. You can fix your code by doing:</p>
<pre><code>x.sort()
print x
</code></pre>

For readability purposes, it was decided that functions that modify existing objects should not return the objects after modification.</span>
