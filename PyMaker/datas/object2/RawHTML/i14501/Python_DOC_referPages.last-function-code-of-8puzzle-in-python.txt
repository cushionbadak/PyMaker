<p>I have this code in Python. Swap_blank_tile function creates a new matrix from old matrix. 
I want to put a value to "liste" from my first matrix. Therefore I used matrix2 in "swap_blank_tile" function, but "matrix" also is affected from "swap_blank_tile" function but i do not want it. Only matrix2 must be affected from this function. I can not solve why matrix is also affected from this function.</p>

<p>In your code when:</p>
<pre><code>matrix2=matrix
</code></pre>
<p><code>matrix2</code> and <code>matrix</code> are still references to the same object, so if you change one you'll change the other. You'll probably want to create a deepcopy.</p>
<pre><code>from copy import deepcopy
def result(matrix):
    matrix2=deepcopy(matrix)
    for a in possible_moves(matrix2):
        matrix2=deepcopy(matrix)
        print()
        liste=swap_blank_tile(matrix2,a)
        print(liste)
        print(matrix)
</code></pre>

<p>What data type is <code>matrix</code>?</p>
<p>Possibly it is a list of lists, in which case you need to make a complete copy of matrix. Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#copy.deepcopy" rel="nofollow"><code>copy.deepcopy()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from copy import deepcopy
matrix2 = deepcopy(matrix)
</code></pre>
<p>The reason for this is that <code>matrix2 = matrix</code> does not make a copy of <code>matrix</code>, it simply binds the name <code>matrix2</code> to the same object. Therefore any change made to the object is visible from both variables. <code>deepcopy()</code> will descend into the object and make a copy of any nested objects resulting in 2 independent objects.</p>
