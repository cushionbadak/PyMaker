<p>I am following the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/memcachier#python" rel="nofollow">instructions</a> on Heroku for using Memcahier with Python. </p>
<p>When trying to use the 'mc' variable, which is set in settings.py, in another file I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>    Exception Value:    name 'mc' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried importing settings.py into the file I wish to use the 'mc' variable but I get another error:</p>
<pre><code>'Settings' object has no attribute 'mc'
</code></pre>
<p>How can I access this mc variable outside of the settings file?</p>
</div>

<p>This is probably an importing issue.</p>
<p>You need to access <code>mc</code> via <code>settings.mc</code>, because, provided you imported it using <code>import settings</code> at the beginning of the file, it is not included in your current namespace, but in a seperate one called "settings".</p>
<p>If you whish to import it directly into your current namespace, use </p>
<pre><code>from settings import *
</code></pre>
<p>instead.</p>
<p>This only works, when your own file is in the same directory as settings.py, or if settings.py is in a directory known to Python. (See <strong>PYTHONPATH</strong>)</p>
<p>If settings.py is in another Directory, you could for example Import it using the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/67692">whole path</a></p>
<p>It never hurts to skim over the Python docs, by the way: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">see this</a></p>
<p>Also, make sure to use the correct case for your settings module. If the settings file is imported as "settings" with a lowercase letter, then you have to access it like that all over the place, because <em>Python is case sensitive</em></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I had previously tried to access the variable via settings.mc and had the same error as my question.  However using import * has fixed this, thank you !</span>
