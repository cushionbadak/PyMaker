<p>Hi im trying to write a program which uses a repetition statement to allow users to enter 5 numbers and stores them in a list.Then allow the user to search the list for a number entered by the user and indicate whether the number has been   found or not. Im quite stuck on this one, I've made as much of an effort as i can</p>
<pre><code>data =raw_input('Please input 5 numbers: ')
print data

search =raw_input('Search for the numer: ')
for sublist in data:
   if sublist[1] == search:
    print "Found it!", sublist
 break        
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You might try something like this</p>
<pre><code>numbers = []

while len(numbers) &lt; 5:
    number = raw_input('Please input 5 numbers: ')
    if number.isdigit():
        numbers.append(int(number)) #may want to use float here instead of int
    else:
        print "You entered something that isn't a number"

search = raw_input('Search for the numer: ')
if int(search) in numbers:
    print "Found it!"
</code></pre>
<p>your code indicates that you may be using sublists but it is unclear how you are creating them.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>data</code> is a string, the <code>for</code> loop  will loop over every character in this string. That's probably not what you want.</p>
<p>If you want to find an integer in a list of integers, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow"><code>split</code></a> the input on whitespace and convert each to an integer using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow"><code>int</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>ints = [int(x) for x in data.split()]
if int(search) in ints:
    print "Found it"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>Issue 1</strong>: This line stores the input as a string in the variable <code>data</code>.</p>
<pre><code>data =raw_input('Please input 5 numbers: ')
</code></pre>
<p>At this point it is necessary to split the string into a list, and converting the elements to integers.
If the user inputs numbers separated by a space, you can do:</p>
<pre><code>data_list = data.split() # if the numbers are comma-separated do .split(',') instead
int_list = [int(element) for element in data_list]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Issue 2:</strong> The users search input should be converted to an integer</p>
<pre><code>search =raw_input('Search for the numer: ')
search_int = int(search)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Issue 3:</strong> There is no need for indexing the sublist as you've attempted <code>sublist[1]</code>.
The for-loop should then be:</p>
<pre><code>for sublist in int_list:
    if sublist == search_int:
        print "Found it!", sublist
        break
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">If you convert the <code>search</code> into an <code>int</code>, but not the <code>data_list</code> - this will never work... also - you don't require an explicit for look and comparison... just using: <code>if search in data_list</code> will do it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, thanks, fixing this.</span>
