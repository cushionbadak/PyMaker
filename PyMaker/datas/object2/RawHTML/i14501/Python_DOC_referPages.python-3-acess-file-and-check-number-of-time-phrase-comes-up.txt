<p>I'm trying to check a TSV of results and want to see how many times F and S come up (for failure or success) however I'm not sure how to doing this counting, or how to having it search the file</p>
<p>I've come across something that is sort of what I'm looking for: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13103148/python-program-how-to-count-number-of-times-the-letter-c-shows-up">Python Program how to count number of times the letter c shows up</a></p>
<pre><code>def countletter(S, F): 
    count = 0
    for x in S:
        if x.lower() == F.lower():
            count += 1
    return count

print (countletter("abcdefFf","F"))
</code></pre>
<p>But it isn't perfect and I'm not sure how to make it search the file.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming that the count result applies to the whole file you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow"><code>collections.Counter</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

with open('input.tsv') as infile:
    counts = Counter(infile.read())

for c in 'SF':
    print '{}: {}'.format(c, counts.get(c))
</code></pre>
<p>This has the advantage of allowing you to obtain counts of any character (not just "S" and "F") with one pass of the file.</p>
<p>You could also just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count" rel="nofollow"><code>str.count()</code></a> for a specific character (or a string), but if you need counts more than one character you'll find a <code>Counter</code> more convenient and probably faster too.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to pass the file contents to your <code>countletter</code> function. </p>
<pre><code>with open("FILE_TO_OPEN_AND_READ.txt") as f:
    data = f.read()

print (countletter(data,"F"))
</code></pre>
<p>This opens and reads the file into <code>data</code>. For this example, I'm assuming your file is relatively small. Then <code>data</code> is passed into <code>countletter</code> as the first parameter, instead of a hardcoded string (<code>"abcdefFf"</code> in your example).</p>
<p>One note about your code, you are missing a closing parenthesis in your <code>print</code> statement. I've added that in my example above.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>open(filename).read()</code> gets you the contents of a file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print (countletter("abcdefFf","F")</code> which result is expected? 1 or 3? Example script will print 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Reishin I don't know I only took it from this: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13103148/python-program-how-to-count-number-of-times-the-letter-c-shows-up" title="python program how to count number of times the letter c shows up">stackoverflow.com/questions/13103148/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you need a count per line, or a count for the whole file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">count the whole file</span>
