<p>I run through my code using pep8, pyflakes, and pylint; which all validate the content and format of my Python code.</p>
<p>What I am looking for now is to validate that my Python code is commented properly and completely. For example, if there is a comment for every method, and each of those method's arguments are also commented, as well as expected returns and exceptions. The some true for Classes and Constants and Properties.</p>
<p>I also run my code through Sphinx and Doxygen for document generation.</p>
<p>Thx</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think you are looking for some kind of <a href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/doctest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doc testing</a>. Also from the main docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. For future reference, typically asking for software recommendations is off-topic for SO.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think "commented"  should be replaced with "documented". Comments != docstrings.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your reply. Correct, I was referring to <b>well documented</b> code. However, <b><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doctest</a></b> module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to verify that they work exactly as shown.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To clarify what I am looking for is to assure <b>well documented</b> code that follows <b><a href="http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/docstring_python.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sphinx and RST syntax guide</a></b>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, this exactly what I was looking for.</span>
