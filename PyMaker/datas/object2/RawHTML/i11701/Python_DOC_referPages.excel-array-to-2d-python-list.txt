<p>So I have to create a list in Python using two excel spreadsheets that have been provided (that show a list of names, locations, salaries, etc...) for a mock company employee info list. I am required to turn it into a 2D python list. </p>
<p>I believe I have the code down right, but I keep geeting an error due to the `x =+ 1'. Am I missing something?</p>
<pre><code>def location_dict():
    f2 = open("Hw#5_Locations.csv", "r")
    dict1 = {}
    for b in f2:
        c = b.split(",")
        dict1[c[0]] = c[1]
        print("dict1", dict1)
    f2.close()
    return dict1

f1 = open("Hw#5_Employees.csv", "r")
x = 0
salary = []
ID_Salary = []
dict2 = location_dict()
for aline in f1:
    aline = aline.replace('\n','')
    values = aline.split(",")
    print(values[0], values[5])

    salary.append([values[0],values[1],values[2],values[5],values[7]])

    if x &gt; 0:
        print("Salary[",x,"]", salary[x][0], salary[x][1], dict2[salary[x]    [2]])

    print("======= end line:", x)

    x =+ 1
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow"><code>csv</code></a> module. The defaults of <code>csv.reader</code> will read CSV files in Excel dialect:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('Hw#5_Employees.csv', 'r') as f:
    c = csv.reader(f)
    data = list(c)

# do something with data
</code></pre>
<p>You can also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader" rel="nofollow">read the data into a dictionary structure</a>, so that you can access columns by name.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Syntax is wrong, Its <code>x += 1</code>.  <code>x =+1</code> will just keep setting x to 1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hmm... still didn't work... Do I need a <code>dict2 = {}</code> or something? I don't have a key for it...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should also edit your question: you don't have excel spreadsheets, you have two text files, comma-separated values (which Excel can open and show like a worksheet).  Actually importing from a worksheet (which is saved in a proprietary format) or directly from Excel is a much more complicated problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is the error that you are getting?</span>
