<p>Im stuck with this very simple code were I'm trying to create a function that takes a parameter and adds 1 to the result and returns it but somehow this code gives me no results. (I've called the function to see if it works.)</p>
<p>Somebody please help me since I'm very new to python :)</p>
<pre><code>def increment(num):
    num += 1
a = int(input("Type a number "))
increment(a)`
</code></pre>
<p>I changed it to </p>
<pre><code>def increment(num):
    return num + 1
a = int(input("Type a number "))
increment(a)`
</code></pre>
<p>but still no results are showing after I enter a number, Does anybody know?</p>
</div>

<p>You need to return some value or it never will appear.</p>
<pre><code>def increment(num):
    return num + 1
a = int(input("Type a number "))
increment(a)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to ensure you return the num in the increment function and assign it to a.
Return:
    def increment(num):
        return num + 1</p>
<p>Assign:
    a = increment(a)</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-return-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>return</code> statement</a></span>

<span class="comment-copy">As @DonkeyKong said: This code makes no attempt to show anything. You'll need to <code>print</code> the result.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is incorrect, you are not modifying the variable outside the scope of the function, you would need to use the global keyword</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Example of it: <a href="http://postimg.org/image/gmvxkrhdh/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NoReturn + Return + Global</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">if they are passing through parameter a as num wouldnt you do a = increment(a), where increment returns num + 1 and not use a global. I am confused as what you are trying to say by the example. Anyway hopefully I have edited answer to make it more explicit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ah my bad! I was trying to reformat my comment on the other answer not yours</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's alright, I'm still learning so just getting feedback where I can!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">we never do stop learning haha</span>
