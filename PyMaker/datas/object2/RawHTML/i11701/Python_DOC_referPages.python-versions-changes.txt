<p>It is unlikely that programs will port painlessly from Python 2 to Python 3. Changing the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/using/unix.html" rel="nofollow">"shebang"</a> at the beginning of the script is completely unrelated to the porting process: all that does is to allow the shell (<code>bash</code>) to run the script through one version of Python versus another.
You should read more about the differences between Python 2 and Python 3 in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>
