<span class="comment-copy">@Bhargav Rao: Can u explain how <code>*</code> is working or give some links which explain <code>*</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Vivek You can learn more about the <code>*</code> operator here <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Aside the fact that this question benefits from <code>zip</code> specifically returning a list of tuples, more generally <code>zip(*X)</code> can be thought of as the matrix transpose of <code>X</code>. Which is useful to people who've done lots of linear algebra and therefore would naturally think of the questioner's required re-ordering as transposition.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BhargavRao: Updated answer, and who down voted answer can also check and let me know if it is there is any issue :)</span>
