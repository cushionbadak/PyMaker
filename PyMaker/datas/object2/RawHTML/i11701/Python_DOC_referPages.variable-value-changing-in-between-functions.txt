<p>What <strong>exactly</strong> are the Python scoping rules?</p>
<p>If I have some code:</p>
<pre><code>code1
class Foo:
   code2
   def spam.....
      code3
      for code4..:
       code5
       x()
</code></pre>
<p>Where is <code>x</code> found?  Some possible choices include the list below:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the enclosing source file</li>
<li>In the class namespace</li>
<li>In the function definition</li>
<li>In the for loop index variable</li>
<li>Inside the for loop</li>
</ol>
<p>Also there is the context during execution, when the function <code>spam</code> is passed somewhere else. And maybe <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions" rel="noreferrer">lambda functions</a> pass a bit differently?</p>
<p>There must be a simple reference or algorithm somewhere.  It's a confusing world for intermediate Python programmers.</p>

<p>Actually, a concise rule for Python Scope resolution, from <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0596513984" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Learning Python, 3rd. Ed.</a>. (These rules are specific to variable names, not attributes. If you reference it without a period, these rules apply)</p>
<p>LEGB Rule.</p>
<p><strong>L</strong>, Local — Names assigned in any way within a function (<code>def</code> or <code>lambda</code>)), and not declared global in that function.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>, Enclosing-function locals — Name in the local scope of any and all statically enclosing functions (<code>def</code> or <code>lambda</code>), from inner to outer.</p>
<p><strong>G</strong>, Global (module) — Names assigned at the top-level of a module file, or by executing a <code>global</code> statement in a <code>def</code> within the file.</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>, Built-in (Python) — Names preassigned in the built-in names module : <code>open</code>,<code>range</code>,<code>SyntaxError</code>,...</p>
<p>So, in the case of</p>
<pre><code>code1
class Foo:
   code2
   def spam.....
      code3
      for code4..:
       code5
       x()
</code></pre>
<p>The for loop does not have its own namespace. In LEGB order, the scopes would be </p>
<p>L : local, in <code>def spam</code> (in <code>code3</code>, <code>code 4</code>, <code>code5</code>).</p>
<p>E : Enclosed function, any enclosing functions (if the whole example were in another <code>def</code>)</p>
<p>G : Global. Were there any <code>x</code> declared globally in the module (<code>code1</code>)?</p>
<p>B : Any builtin <code>x</code> in Python.</p>
<p><code>x</code> will never be found in <code>code2</code> (even in cases where you might expect it would, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/23471004/2810305">Antti's answer</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/13905741/2810305">here</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Essentially, the only thing in Python that introduces a new scope is a function definition.  Classes are a bit of a special case in that anything defined directly in the body is placed in the class's namespace, but they are not directly accessible from within the methods (or nested classes) they contain.</p>
<p>In your example there are only 3 scopes where x will be searched in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>spam's scope - containing everything defined in code3 and code5 (as well as code4, your loop variable)</p></li>
<li><p>The global scope - containing everything defined in code1, as well as Foo (and whatever changes after it)</p></li>
<li><p>The builtins namespace.  A bit of a special case - this contains the various Python builtin functions and types such as len() and str(). Generally this shouldn't be modified by any user code, so expect it to contain the standard functions and nothing else.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More scopes only appear when you introduce a nested function (or lambda) into the picture.
These will behave pretty much as you'd expect however.  The nested function can access everything in the local scope, as well as anything in the enclosing function's scope. eg.</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    x=4
    def bar():
        print x  # Accesses x from foo's scope
    bar()  # Prints 4
    x=5
    bar()  # Prints 5
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Restrictions:</strong></p>
<p>Variables in scopes other than the local function's variables can be accessed, but can't be rebound to new parameters without further syntax.  Instead, assignment will create a new <strong>local</strong> variable instead of affecting the variable in the parent scope.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>global_var1 = []
global_var2 = 1

def func():
    # This is OK: It's just accessing, not rebinding
    global_var1.append(4) 

    # This won't affect global_var2. Instead it creates a new variable
    global_var2 = 2 

    local1 = 4
    def embedded_func():
        # Again, this doen't affect func's local1 variable.  It creates a 
        # new local variable also called local1 instead.
        local1 = 5
        print local1

    embedded_func() # Prints 5
    print local1    # Prints 4
</code></pre>
<p>In order to actually modify the bindings of global variables from within a function scope, you need to specify that the variable is global with the global keyword.  Eg:</p>
<pre><code>global_var = 4
def change_global():
    global global_var
    global_var = global_var + 1
</code></pre>
<p>Currently there is no way to do the same for variables in enclosing <em>function</em> scopes, but Python 3 introduces a new keyword, "<code>nonlocal</code>" which will act in a similar way to global, but for nested function scopes.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There was no thorough answer concerning Python3 time, so I made an answer here.</p>
<p>As provided in other answers, there are 4 basic scopes, the LEGB, for Local, Enclosing, Global and Builtin. In addition to those, there is a special scope, the <strong>class body</strong>, which does not comprise an enclosing scope for methods defined within the class; any assignments within the class body make the variable from there on be bound in the class body.</p>
<p>Especially, <strong>no</strong> block statement, besides <code>def</code> and <code>class</code>, create a variable scope. In Python 2 a list comprehension does not create a variable scope, however in Python 3 the loop variable within list comprehensions is created in a new scope.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the peculiarities of the class body</p>
<pre><code>x = 0
class X(object):
    y = x
    x = x + 1 # x is now a variable 
    z = x

    def method(self):
        print(self.x) # -&gt; 1
        print(x)      # -&gt; 0, the global x
        print(y)      # -&gt; NameError: global name 'y' is not defined

inst = X()
print(inst.x, inst.y, inst.z, x) # -&gt; (1, 0, 1, 0)
</code></pre>
<p>Thus unlike in function body, you can reassign the variable to the same name in class body, to get a class variable with the same name; further lookups on this name resolve 
to the class variable instead.</p>
<hr/>
<p>One of the greater surprises to many newcomers to Python is that a <code>for</code> loop does not create a variable scope. In Python 2 the list comprehensions do not create a scope either (while generators and dict comprehensions do!) Instead they leak the value in the function or the global scope:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [ i for i in range(5) ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; i
4
</code></pre>
<p>The comprehensions can be used as a cunning (or awful if you will) way to make modifiable variables within lambda expressions in Python 2 - a lambda expression does create a variable scope, like the <code>def</code> statement would, but within lambda no statements are allowed. Assignment being a statement in Python means that no variable assignments in lambda are allowed, but a list comprehension is an expression...</p>
<p>This behaviour has been fixed in Python 3 - no comprehension expressions or generators leak variables.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The global really means the module scope; the main python module is the <code>__main__</code>; all imported modules are accessible through the <code>sys.modules</code> variable; to get access to <code>__main__</code> one can use <code>sys.modules['__main__']</code>, or <code>import __main__</code>; it is perfectly acceptable to access and assign attributes there; they will show up as variables in the global scope of the main module.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If a name is ever assigned to in the current scope (except in the class scope), it will be considered belonging to that scope, otherwise it will be considered to belonging to any enclosing scope that assigns to the variable (it might not be assigned yet, or not at all), or finally the global scope. If the variable is considered local, but it is not set yet, or has been deleted, reading the variable value will result in <code>UnboundLocalError</code>, which is a subclass of <code>NameError</code>.</p>
<pre><code>x = 5
def foobar():
    print(x)  # causes UnboundLocalError!
    x += 1    # because assignment here makes x a local variable within the function

# call the function
foobar()
</code></pre>
<p>The scope can declare that it explicitly wants to modify the global (module scope) variable, with the global keyword:</p>
<pre><code>x = 5
def foobar():
    global x
    print(x) # -&gt; 5
    x += 1

foobar()
print(x) # -&gt; 6
</code></pre>
<p>This also is possible even if it was shadowed in enclosing scope:</p>
<pre><code>x = 5
y = 13
def make_closure():
    x = 42
    y = 911
    def func():
        global x # sees the global value
        print(x, y)
        x += 1

    return func

func = make_closure()
func()      # -&gt; print 5 911
print(x, y) # -&gt; 6 13
</code></pre>
<p>In python 2 there is no easy way to modify the value in the enclosing scope; usually this is simulated by having a mutable value, such as a list with length of 1:</p>
<pre><code>def make_closure():
    value = [0]
    def get_next_value():
        value[0] += 1
        return value[0]

    return get_next_value

get_next = make_closure()
print(get_next()) # -&gt; 1
print(get_next()) # -&gt; 2
</code></pre>
<p>However in python 3, the <code>nonlocal</code> comes to rescue:</p>
<pre><code>def make_closure():
    value = 0
    def get_next_value():
        nonlocal value
        value += 1
        return value
    return get_next_value

get_next = make_closure() # identical behavior to the previous example.
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Any variable that is not deemed to be local to the current scope, or any enclosing scope, is a global variable. A global name is looked up in the module global dictionary; if not found, the global is then looked up from the builtins module; the name of the module was changed from python 2 to python 3; in python 2 it was <code>__builtin__</code> and in python 3 it is now called <code>builtins</code>. If you assign to an attribute of builtins module, it will be visible thereafter to any module as a readable global variable, unless that module shadows them with its own global variable with the same name.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Reading the builtin module can also be useful; suppose that you want the python 3 style print function in some parts of file, but other parts of file still use the <code>print</code> statement. In Python 2.6-2.7 you can get hold of the Python 3 <code>print</code> function with:</p>
<pre><code>import __builtin__

print3 = __builtin__.__dict__['print']
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>from __future__ import print_function</code> actually does not import the <code>print</code> function anywhere in Python 2 - instead it just disables the parsing rules for <code>print</code> statement in the current module, handling <code>print</code> like any other variable identifier, and thus allowing the <code>print</code> the function be looked up in the builtins.</p>

<p>The scoping rules for Python 2.x have been outlined already in other answers. The only thing I would add is that in Python 3.0, there is also the concept of a non-local scope (indicated by the 'nonlocal' keyword). This allows you to access outer scopes directly, and opens up the ability to do some neat tricks, including lexical closures (without ugly hacks involving mutable objects).</p>
<p>EDIT: Here's the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3104/" rel="noreferrer">PEP</a> with more information on this.</p>

<p>Python resolves your variables with -- generally -- three namespaces available.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>At any time during execution, there
  are at least three nested scopes whose
  namespaces are directly accessible:
  the innermost scope, which is searched
  first, contains the local names; the
  namespaces of any enclosing functions,
  which are searched starting with the
  nearest enclosing scope; the middle
  scope, searched next, contains the
  current module's global names; and the
  outermost scope (searched last) is the
  namespace containing built-in names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two functions: <code>globals</code> and <code>locals</code> which show you the contents two of these namespaces.</p>
<p>Namespaces are created by packages, modules, classes, object construction and functions.  There aren't any other flavors of namespaces.  </p>
<p>In this case, the call to a function named <code>x</code> has to be resolved in the local name space or the global namespace.</p>
<p>Local in this case, is the body of the method function <code>Foo.spam</code>.</p>
<p>Global is -- well -- global. </p>
<p>The rule is to search the nested local spaces created by method functions (and nested function definitions), then search global.  That's it.</p>
<p>There are no other scopes.  The <code>for</code> statement (and other compound statements like <code>if</code> and <code>try</code>) don't create new nested scopes.  Only definitions (packages, modules, functions, classes and object instances.)</p>
<p>Inside a class definition, the names are part of the class namespace.  <code>code2</code>, for instance, must be qualified by the class name.  Generally <code>Foo.code2</code>.  However, <code>self.code2</code> will also work because Python objects look at the containing class as a fall-back.</p>
<p>An object (an instance of a class) has instance variables.  These names are in the object's namespace.  They must be qualified by the object.  (<code>variable.instance</code>.)  </p>
<p>From within a class method, you have locals and globals.  You say <code>self.variable</code> to pick the instance as the namespace.  You'll note that <code>self</code> is an argument to every class member function, making it part of the local namespace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is x found?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>x is not found as you haven't defined it. :-) It could be found in code1 (global) or code3 (local) if you put it there.</p>
<p>code2 (class members) aren't visible to code inside methods of the same class — you would usually access them using self. code4/code5 (loops) live in the same scope as code3, so if you wrote to x in there you would be changing the x instance defined in code3, not making a new x.</p>
<p>Python is statically scoped, so if you pass ‘spam’ to another function spam will still have access to globals in the module it came from (defined in code1), and any other containing scopes (see below). code2 members would again be accessed through self.</p>
<p>lambda is no different to def. If you have a lambda used inside a function, it's the same as defining a nested function. In Python 2.2 onwards, nested scopes are available. In this case you can bind x at any level of function nesting and Python will pick up the innermost instance:</p>
<pre><code>x= 0
def fun1():
    x= 1
    def fun2():
        x= 2
        def fun3():
            return x
        return fun3()
    return fun2()
print fun1(), x

2 0
</code></pre>
<p>fun3 sees the instance x from the nearest containing scope, which is the function scope associated with fun2. But the other x instances, defined in fun1 and globally, are not affected.</p>
<p>Before nested_scopes — in Python pre-2.1, and in 2.1 unless you specifically ask for the feature using a from-future-import — fun1 and fun2's scopes are not visible to fun3, so S.Lott's answer holds and you would get the global x:</p>
<pre><code>0 0
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">U did not cover the scope of <code>code2</code>. That is not a variable and is a class/instance attribute. Is that right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">my intuition says that code2 exists inside the class scope of <code>Foo</code>, and could be accessed from any scope with access to <code>Foo</code> with <code>Foo.code2</code> or from within <code>Foo</code> with the same syntax.  But I'm not sure yet where that falls within the LEGB mnemonic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As a caveat to Global access - reading a global variable can happen without explicit declaration, but writing to it without declaring global(var_name) will instead create a new local instance.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually @Peter, <code>global(var_name)</code> is syntactically incorrect. The correct syntax would be <code>global var_name</code> without parentheses. You have a valid point though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jonathan: Because each <code>y</code> is being written to and there are no <code>global y</code> declarations -- see @Peter's comment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"however in Python 3 the loop variable is created in a new scope" what did you mean saying that? For example here gist.github.com/worldmind/f6caf6da5dcc5d7d4bc552b412bbf7aa loops variables is accessible in a main() scope.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexeyShrub added "within list comprehensions"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is great answer. However, I think that the differences between <code>method</code> and <code>method_local_ref</code> should be highlighted. <code>method</code> is able to access the global variable and print it as in <code>5. Global x</code>. But <code>method_local_ref</code> cannot because later on it defines a local variable with that same name. You can test this by removing the <code>x = 200</code> line and see the difference</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@brianray: What about z?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kiril I added a note about that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MalikA.Rumi I removed z as it wasn't interesting</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Surprisingly, this is the <b>only</b> clear explanation of Python scopes, that I could find on all of SO. Simply using a very basic example. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is out of date. Since 2.1 (7 years ago) there are more than two scopes, as nested functions introduce new scopes, so a function within a function will have access to its local scope, the enclosing functions scope, and global scope (also builtins).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry, this is no longer the case. <code>Python has two namespaces available. Global and local-to-something.</code></span>
