<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>list1 = [1,2,4,5,7,8,9]  corresponds to ID
list2 = [3,2,1,1,1,2,3]  corresponds to relevance
</code></pre>
<p>I have two different lists say list1,list2 with numerical values in it. I want to write both to a csv file with headers ["ID","Relevance"]. Now I want to write values of list1 in header "ID" and list2 in header "Relevance". I have written below code trying to write both lists but it doesnt give desired output.</p>
<p>I want output to be in below sample format:</p>
<pre><code>ID    Relevance
1         3
3         2
4         2
6         1
7         3
10        1
</code></pre>
<p>code:</p>
<pre><code>with open('results_cosine11.csv', 'w', encoding="ISO-8859-1", newline='') as myfile:
    wr = csv.writer(myfile)
    for value in list1,list2:
        wr.writerow([value])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you're looking for is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow"><code>zip()</code></a>. This will work:</p>
<pre><code>with open('results_cosine11.csv', 'w', encoding="ISO-8859-1", newline='') as myfile:
    wr = csv.writer(myfile)
    for value in zip(list1,list2):
        wr.writerow(value)
</code></pre>
<p>Or, more efficiently:</p>
<pre><code>with open('results_cosine11.csv', 'w', encoding="ISO-8859-1", newline='') as myfile:
    wr = csv.writer(myfile)
    wr.writerows(zip(list1,list2))
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>In order to write the header too:</p>
<pre><code>with open('results_cosine11.csv', 'w', encoding="ISO-8859-1", newline='') as myfile:
    wr = csv.writer(myfile)
    wr.writerow(("ID", "Relevance"))
    wr.writerows(zip(list1,list2))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try </p>
<pre><code>a= zip(list1,list2)
for id,relevance in a:
   #... do  whatever 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@Malvolio I have tried every possible code from stackover flow, but I could not get expected results. Above posted code is the final code which I am preferring currently.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>wr.writerows(zip(list1, list2))</code> works too, without the need for creating a temporary list to consume the map.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ilja Didn't see it exists. Thanks, updated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bharel I also want to write headers in first row as ID, Relevance</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ilja -- the <code>writerows</code> interface still creates the temporary list.  The list is never <i>named</i> (the expression is resolved anonymously and passed as the actual parameter to writerows), which is a good thing, because the programmer (and the garbage collector) knows that the zipped list will never be reused, but no great savings of resources.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Malvolio <code>zip()</code> is a generator in python 3. Are you sure <code>writerows</code> internally creates a list? I believe it's useless.</span>
