<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For example if we have the method <strong>lt</strong>() implemented in a class and we try to use the greater than operator it will not raise an exception because it will use the less than method to compute a result. Is there some kind of table that exists that shows all of the operators and the operators that are called if the original operators were not defined? I did some searching but did not find what I was looking for. </p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>EDIT: Trying to find a list of magic methods that are called when an operator is used with objects but no operator method is defined in the object's class </p>

<p>If want to overload an operator, you can implement the <em>special</em> (dunder <code>__</code>) methods. You will find them here - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names</a>
If you are looking for operators for efficient iteration purposes check the <code>operator</code> module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This question is unclear. Are you trying to find a list of all magic methods that are called when operators are used?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes Precisely, Trying to find the list of magic methods that are called when each operator fails</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You may want to specify that dunder is short for double underscore <code>__</code></span>
