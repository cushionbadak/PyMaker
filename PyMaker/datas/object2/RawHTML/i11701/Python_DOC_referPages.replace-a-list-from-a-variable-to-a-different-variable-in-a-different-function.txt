<p>I want to replace the elements from list <code>letters</code> with the list elements from list <code>animals</code> where as <code>print(letters)</code> would print</p>
<pre><code>["cat","dog","mouse","rabbit","hamster","duck","chicken","goose","hedgehog"]
</code></pre>
<p>How do I pass the value of the variable <code>animals</code> from the function <code>newlist</code> to the function <code>main</code> and then replace the value of variable in <code>main</code></p>
<p>Code</p>
<pre><code>def newlist():
    animals = ["cat","dog","mouse","rabbit","hamster","duck","chicken","goose","hedgehog"]
def main():
    letters = ["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I"]
    print(letters)
main()  
</code></pre>

<p>Do note that functions in Python have to be called and they return specific values or <code>None</code> if nothing is specified. </p>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow">Python Tutorial</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>return</code> statement returns with a value from a function. <code>return</code> without an expression argument returns <code>None</code>. Falling off the end of a function also returns <code>None</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence you need to define your function <code>newlist</code> as </p>
<pre><code>def newlist():
     animals = ["cat","dog","mouse","rabbit","hamster","duck","chicken","goose","hedgehog"]
     return animals       # RETURN THE LIST
</code></pre>
<p>This will return the list as intended. </p>
<p>To get the list you need to call the function that can be done using <code>newlist()</code>. Hence your <code>main</code> function will look like</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    letters = ["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I"]
    letters = newlist()   # CALL THE FUNCTION 
    print(letters)
</code></pre>
<p>Now when you call <code>main</code>, you will get the intended output. </p>
<hr/>
<p>You do not need to create a separate list with placeholders. You can directly call <code>newlist</code> to get your list ready and working. In such a case the <code>main</code> function will be reduced to</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    letters = newlist()   # newlist returns a list, so call directly 
    print(letters)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">i'm trying to create an accounting program which gets lists and replace it with list elements from another list... i posted this much for simplicity that's all i need anyways, any help would be much appreciated..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i think it's very clear. i don't know how to rephrase it clearer. it's just replacing the elements on list <code>letters</code> with elements on <code>animals</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>letters = list(animals)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">that would get an error like animals is not defined. it's from a different function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Change <code>animals = ...</code> to <code>return ...</code> and then do <code>letters = newlist()</code> in <code>main()</code>.  If you want to change the actual list object, use <code>letters[:] = newlist()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks! that is what i was looking for. you're the best!</span>
