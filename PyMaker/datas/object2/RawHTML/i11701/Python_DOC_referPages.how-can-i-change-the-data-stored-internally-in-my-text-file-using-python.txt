<p>My program has to assign a case number to each user who runs the program. I want to store the number 1 in the text file and assign it as the case number for the first person who opens the text file. Once the program has finished running I want to increase the number in the text file by 1 so that the next person who uses the program has a different case number. How can I do this? </p>
<p>P.S. I am a beginner at Python but I have an idea of most of the language</p>

<p>Check out the python manuals for further details about file writing and reading. This is a basic method to write a number to a file:</p>
<pre><code>with open("myfile.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("0")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Open the file and save the content. Then find the line and edit it. Then write all the lines back into the file with argument <b>'w'</b>. Nothing complicated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What inquisitive said.  Please try and create a program yourself and if you encounter issues come back and post your code and the errors you are running into.</span>
