<p>I am trying to run only a single test from the unit tests provided in a class. So assuming</p>
<pre><code>class MytestSuite(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_false(self):
        a = False
        self.assertFalse(a, "Its false")

    def test_true(self):
        a = True
        self.assertTrue(a, "Its true")
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to run only test_false. Based on the Q&amp;A provided on this site and online I used the following lines of code in my main class</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":  #Indentation was wronng
    singletest = unittest.TestSuite()
    singletest.addTest(MytestSuite().test_false)
    unittest.TextTestRunner().run(singletest)
</code></pre>
<p>I keep getting errors while trying to add the test. Mainly:</p>
<pre><code>  File "C:\Python27\Lib\unittest\case.py", line 189, in __init__
(self.__class__, methodName))
ValueError: no such test method in &lt;class '__main__.MytestSuite'&gt;: runTest
</code></pre>
<p>Do I need a specific runTest method in my class? Is there a way to run particular tests that may belong to different suites. Eg: <strong>method A</strong> belonging to <strong>suite class 1</strong> and <strong>method B</strong> belonging to <strong>suite class 2</strong>. Surprisingly this has proven to be a difficult thing to find online. There are multiple examples of doing it through command-line but not from the program itself. As always, any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>You're just passing the wrong thing to <code>addTest</code>. Rather than passing in a bound method, you need to pass a new instance of <code>TestCase</code> (in your case, an instance of <code>MyTestSuite</code>), constructed with the <em>name</em> of the single test you want it to run.</p>
<pre><code>singletest.addTest(MyTestSuite('test_false'))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I was just about to edit for indentation, but then it struck me. Did you check the indentation for <code>class MytestSuite</code>? Looks like an empty class to me unless the functions were indented.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry about the indentation. I am indenting it properly in my program. I just couldn't get it to work in StackOverflow even though I have been using the site for quite a while :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">4 spaces will do that :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Haha yes. Sorry I was being lazy. It would have been 4 spaces in each line though :) But thank you for doing the needful. Much appreciated</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh Thank You. another reason why I should be more thorough with reading docs.</span>
