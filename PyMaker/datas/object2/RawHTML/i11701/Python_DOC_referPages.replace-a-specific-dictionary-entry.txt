<p>For my assignment I'm required to use file management in order to access information about the price/stock of certain items.</p>
<p>I'm currently using a dict like this</p>
<pre><code>stock = {"Bread" : 27,
"Car" : 1,
"Banana" : 3000}
</code></pre>
<p>How would I go about to change the number of bananas in stock for instance?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>stock["Banana"] = new_value</code> should do it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can access value using key in dictionary , so you can go like this -</p>
<pre><code>stock['Banana']=23  // any desired number
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you try searching for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a>? <code>stock['Banana'] = new_value</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What does file management have to do with this? Are you reading from a file into a dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It would be hard to believe that your teacher(s) have not provided basic information about dictionaries, but just in case here is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Tutorial section</a> on them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user161151 Correct, updating a dictionary is easy I'm just not sure how to do it to another file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok. So presumably you know how to read the data from the file and store it into the <code>dict</code>. And your <i>real</i> question is that you want to know how to write the modified data back to the file. So give it a try! It's not that hard. If you get stuck, put a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> into your question and we'll help you fix it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this does answer the <i>title</i> of my question, I can't access a dictionary in another file with this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Carlgroth, it doesn't just answer the title. it answers the body as well. I see the comment you made, but it doesn't clarify what your problem is percisely. I suggest you try and ask the question you want answered exactly, instead of hoping we guess your problem. State your mission statement, and pseudo-code for what you want to accomplish.</span>
