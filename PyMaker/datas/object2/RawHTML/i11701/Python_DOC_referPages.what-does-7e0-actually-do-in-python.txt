<p>The title explains it all, I found this in a university resource but am wondering why this returns <strong>7.0</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>it returns 7.0, not 7 as it is not an integer. It is a floating point literal, which is why it is 7.0. </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type(7e0)
&lt;type 'float'&gt;

<span class="comment-copy">7 * 10^0 = 7 * 1 = 7</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, but why is it returning 7.0 when it is 10^0 = 1 -&gt; 7 * 1 = 7?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jameshelou: Are you under the impression that 7.0 is mathematically unequal to 7?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In the context of the situation I'm looking at this in, the difference between 7 and 7.0 is important here -_- I'm not asking for mathematical equivalents, I am asking why is it returning 7.0 as opposed to 7?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, this was EXACTLY what I needed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm glad that answered it for you. It's tricky in python as there are no explicit types. If you could accept the answer I'd appreciate it!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "there are no explicit types"? Also, 7e0 is not an operation, it's a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#floating" rel="nofollow noreferrer">literal</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">python is dynamically typed. You don't define a type when you declare a variable. The type is defined by the object a variable name is tied to. I modified to indicate it is a literal, that was my mistake.</span>
