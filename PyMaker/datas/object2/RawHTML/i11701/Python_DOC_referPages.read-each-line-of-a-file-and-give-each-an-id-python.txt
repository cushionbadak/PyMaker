<a dir="ltr" href="/questions/36532911/how-to-assign-ids-to-dictionaries-while-iterating-through-document-input-pytho">How to assign IDs to dictionaries while iterating through document input - Python</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>I need to read each line of an input file and assign each one it's own ID so that it can be identified later on. </p>
<p>This would be simple if I knew the amount of lines that the file would have or if it were short but I need to make it able to take a file with any number of lines</p>
<p>For example the trial file I am using contains this:</p>
<pre><code>somewhere over rainbow bluebirds fly birds fly over rainbow why why
double time population long takes population double size
whoa full rainbow way double rainbow double rainbow way
</code></pre>
<p>and I need to read each line individually and assign it an ID so that <code>somewhere over rainbow bluebirds fly birds fly over rainbow why why</code> is assigned ID 1 and so forth.</p>
<p>I can't seem to be able to find a way to dynamically create variables/variable names and I don't know of any other way of automatically assigning IDs.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can store the lines in a dictionary, with the keys as the ids:</p>
<pre><code>with open(myfile, 'r') as f:
    lines = {i: line for i, line in emumerate(f, 1)}
</code></pre>
<p>This will produce a dictionary with numbers from 1 as keys:</p>
<pre><code>{
    1: "somewhere over rainbow bluebirds fly birds fly over rainbow why why",
    2: "double time population long takes population double size",
    3: "whoa full rainbow way double rainbow double rainbow way"
}
</code></pre>
<p>The second argument to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow">enumerate function</a> sets the starting number for the enumeration, so in this case we start indexing from one; the default is zero if no starting number is provided.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>for line_no,line in enumerate(file,1):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p><code>line_no</code> would be your <code>id</code> ... I guess</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use a dict to store the lines with the id</p>
<p>Here an example</p>
<pre><code>rows = {}
n = 1
with open(filename) as f:
    for line in f:
        rows[n] = line
        n += 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd probably just use a list, with position as ID:</p>
<pre><code>ls = []
with open(file, 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        ls.append(line.rstrip()) 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A dictionary seems like a good solution for this problem. I would also use enumerate to get the line number automatically.</p>
<pre><code>file_name = 'text.txt'
with open(file_name, 'r') as f:
    indexes = {index:value for index, value in enumerate(f)}
&gt;&gt;&gt;indexes[0]
'somewhere over rainbow bluebirds fly birds fly over rainbow why why\n'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What you're looking for is a dictionary or a list. Is this homework? It smells a lot like homework.</span>
