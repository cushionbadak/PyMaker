<p>I am having issues reading the contents of the files I am trying to open due to the fact that python believes there is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"No such file or directory: 'Filename.xrf'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is an outline of my code and what I think the problem may be:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The user's input defines the path to where the files are.</p>
<pre><code>direct = str(raw_input("Enter directory name where your data is: ))           
path = "/Users/myname/Desktop/heasoft/XRF_data/%s/40_keV" \
                                              %(direct)
print os.listdir(path)
# This lists the correct contents of the directory that I wanted it to.
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>So here I essentially let the user decide which directory they want to manipulate and then I choose one more directory path named "40_keV".</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Within a defined function I use the OS module to navigate to the corresponding directory and then append every file within the 40_keV directory to a list, named dataFiles.</p>
<pre><code>def Spectrumdivide():
     dataFiles = []
     for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
         for file in files:
             if file.endswith('.xrf'):
                 dataFiles.append(file)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>Here, the correct files were appended to the list '<code>dataFiles</code>', but I think this may be where the problem is occurring. I'm not sure whether or not <code>Python</code> is adding the NAME of the file to my list instead of the actual file object.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><p>The code breaks because python believes there is no such file or directory.</p>
<pre><code>for filename in dataFiles:
    print filename
    f = open(filename,'r')    # &lt;- THE CODE BREAKS HERE
    print "Opening file: " + filename
    line_num = f.readlines()
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>Again, the correct file is printed from dataFiles[0] in the first iteration of the loop but then this common error is produced:</p>
<pre><code>IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '40keV_1.xrf'
</code></pre>
<p>I'm using an <code>Anaconda</code> launcher to run <code>Spyder (Python 2.7)</code> and the files are text files containing two columns of equal length. The goal is to assign each column to a list and the manipulate them accordingly.</p>

<p>You need to append the path name not just the file's name using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join" rel="nofollow"><code>os.path.join</code></a> function.</p>
<pre><code>for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
    for file in files:
        if file.endswith('.xrf'):
            dataFiles.append(os.path.join(root, file))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Try seeing (by using print) what is inside the ´filename´ variable. I think that you are not keeping the path to the file (only the name) and that's why it can't find it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi and thanks! os.path.join worked. What value is root assigned in this code? The cwd?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AustinS <code>root</code> here is the path to the directory. More infos in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></span>
