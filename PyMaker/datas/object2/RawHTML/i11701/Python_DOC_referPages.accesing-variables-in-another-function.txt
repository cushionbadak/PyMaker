<p>I need to make to be able to access variables from another function in the program. This is nothing major in terms of programming but it's something I need to know to build up more knowledge.</p>
<pre><code>def s():
    v = 6 + 4
    a()
    return v

def a():
    ace = v + 4
    print(ace)

s()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you plan to invoke the a function within another function then just pass your needed variable as a parameter! You also have a <strong>return</strong> within <strong><em>s</em></strong> that would cause your program to <strong>return</strong> before executing <strong><em>a</em></strong>.
Ex...</p>
<pre><code>def s():
    v = 6 + 4
    a(v)

def a(v):
    ace = v + 4
    print(ace)

s()
</code></pre>
<p>If you wanted to use a return then you could invoke one method as a parameter of another. This would allow you to use both methods independently of one another but it can get very messy!</p>
<pre><code>def s():
    v = 6 + 4
    return v

def a(v):
    ace = v + 4
    print(ace)

a(s())
</code></pre>
<p>Good Luck and hope this helps!!</p>

<p>Assuming that the <code>return v</code> and <code>a()</code> calls in <code>s()</code> are unintentionally swapped, you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement" rel="nofollow"><code>global</code></a> statement:</p>
<pre><code>def s():
    global v
    v = 6 + 4
    a()
    return v

def a():
    ace = v + 4
    print(ace)

s()
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>14
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">In <code>s()</code> you have probably swapped the <code>return v</code> and <code>a()</code> statements. The way you have it now the <code>a()</code> does not get called as the <code>s()</code> returns before the call.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What are you trying to do? why do you <code>return</code> before calling <code>a</code> inside <code>s</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you can i pass multiple variables along functions like def a(v,word, position) etc?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes you can pass as many variables into a function as long as you specify that that function takes the same amount of parameters passed! This changes when using Lambdas, *args, and **kwargs but well leave that for another time!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">okay thanks for your help</span>
