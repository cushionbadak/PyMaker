<p>I've just managed to run my python code on ubuntu, all seems to be going well. My python script writes out a .csv file every hour and I can't seem to find the .csv file.</p>
<p>Having the .csv file is important as I need to do research on the data. I am also using Filezilla, I would have thought the .csv would have run into there.</p>
<pre><code>import csv
import time

collectionTime= datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') 
mylist= [d['Spaces'] for d in data] 
mylist.append(collectionTime) 
print(mylist) 
with open("CarparkData.csv","a",newline="") as f: 
    writer = csv.writer(f) 
    writer.writerow(mylist)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>In short</strong>, your code is outputting to wherever the file you're opening is in this line:</p>
<pre><code>with open("CarparkData.csv","a",newline="") as f:
</code></pre>
<p>You can change this filename to the location of wherever you'd like the file to be read/written from/to. For example, <code>data/CarparkData.csv</code> if you had a folder named <code>data/</code> within your application dedicated to holding data files.</p>
<p>As written in your code, <code>writer.writerow</code> will write the lines to both python's in-memory object of the file (instantiated with <code>open("filename.csv"...)</code>, and the file itself (in this case, <code>CarparkData.csv</code>). </p>
<p>The way your code is structured, it won't be creating a new .csv every hour because it is using a static filename. If a file with this name did not exist at time of opening, it will create one, and if it did, it will continue to append new lines to the existing file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you include a copy of your code that is writing out to csv? Also, including the directory structure of your project will help</span>
