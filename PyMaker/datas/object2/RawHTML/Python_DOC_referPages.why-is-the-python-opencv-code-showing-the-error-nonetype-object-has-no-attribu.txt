<p>I'm using Python code for using OpenCV in Raspberry PI. My code is shown below.</p>
<pre><code>    import numpy as np
    import cv2

    img = cv2.imread('/home/pi/Project_pi/messi.jpg',0)
    print img[0,0]
</code></pre>
<p>Error is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "Gayathri.py", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    print img[0,0]
TypeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If I were you, I'd check that the file location is correct because if it's not OpenCV doesn't return an Error or Warning, rather makes img <code>None</code>. <code>__getitem__</code> method of a class is typically used to index an object of that class and obviously you can't index a <code>None</code> object.</p>
