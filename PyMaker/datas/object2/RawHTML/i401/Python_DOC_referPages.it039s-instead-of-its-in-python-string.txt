<p>My python string consists of <code>&amp;#039;</code> instead of ' (single quotes). My current objective is to expand compound words like It's to It is, Haven't to Have not. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This has been great for me. I&amp;#039;ve been on it for 2 weeks and in the last week I only had 3 headaches which went away with 2 Tylenol. I was having chronic daily headaches that wouldn&amp;#039;t go away no matter what I took. I&amp;#039;m still a little sleepy during the day, but I know that will get better."</p>

<p>The above statement is an example of the sentence I've been trying to convert.</p>
<p>Can someone suggest a way to convert this into the string format?</p>

This has been great for me. I have been on it for 2 weeks and in the last week I only had 3 headaches which went away with 2 Tylenol. I was having chronic daily headaches that would not go away no matter what I took. I am still a little sleepy during the day, but I know that will get better.
</code></pre>
<p>The above code will work for the text you have provided. Basically, you will have to create a dictionary of all the possible contractions examples - they'll, ther're, etc. </p>
