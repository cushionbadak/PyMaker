<p>I am using 2 ways to print the characters in a string.</p>
<pre><code>s = 'hello'
[print(i) for i in s]
</code></pre>
<p>snippet above produces:</p>
<pre><code>h
e
l
l
o
[None, None, None, None, None]
</code></pre>
<p>while another snippet</p>
<pre><code>s = 'hello'
for i in s:
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>perform normally</p>
<pre><code>h
e
l
l
o
</code></pre>
<p>where are the "None"s coming from?</p>
</div>

<p>I guess you are doing this interactively, so after your list comprehension is done (printing one letter at the time), the result of the list comprehension will be printed.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'hello'
&gt;&gt;&gt; [print(i) for i in s]
h
e
l
l
o
[None, None, None, None, None]
</code></pre>
<p>If you instead stored it to a variable, the list comprehension itself would not be printed:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'hello'
&gt;&gt;&gt; lots_of_nones = [print(i) for i in s]
h
e
l
l
o
</code></pre>
<p>So where are the <code>None</code>s coming from? Well, when you make the list using the list comprehension you are essentially saying "Store the result of the function call <code>print(i)</code> as its elements". Since the print function doesn't return anything, <code>None</code> is stored. It is equivalent to saying:</p>
<pre><code>[None for i in 'hello']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">A list comprehension is a way of creating a list. It is not an all-purpose replacement for a <code>for</code> loop. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehensions</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the result of the <code>print</code> function? By using list comprehension you get a list of all the results of the <code>print</code> function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The None's are coming from the list. I'm assuming you are running this in a repl rather than a script (you should mention this in your question). A script will print exactly the same for both.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perhaps you intended to go after something more like <code>print([i for i in s])</code>? What you've shown us is rather close though! :-)</span>
