<p>I am getting a unresolved import "Blog" in visual studio code. It happened all of a sudden, I am using a venv through conda, I haven't changed anything with the venv, everything is still working, but it's really annoying to have it.
As I said, I haven't changed anything in the project that could potentially create this problem intentionally.</p>
<pre><code>from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from Blog import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path("blog/", include("Blog.urls")),
    path("index/", views.index.as_view(), name="index"),
    path("", include("django.contrib.auth.urls")),
    path("signup/", views.SignUp.as_view(), name="SignUp"),
    path("accounts/", include("django.contrib.auth.urls")),
]

<p>If the <code>Blog</code> module is in a parent directory, then you might need a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14057464/relative-importing-modules-from-parent-folder-subfolder">relative import</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from ...Blog import views
</code></pre>
<p>Or if it's in the same directory, you'll also need a relative import:</p>
<pre><code>from .Blog import views
</code></pre>

<p>The problem was just a bug caused by a Visual Studio Code extension called "Visual Studio IntelliCode - Preview"</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is there a module <code>Blog</code> in your project? Typically a module is named with lowercases, it is possible that the <code>PYTHON_PATH</code> is not set properly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do I set my PYTHON_PATH then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, I am importing views.py from an app Blog</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, ok. Could you please provide your project folder structure with your question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, here you have it. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZTYRjhi" rel="nofollow noreferrer">imgur.com/a/ZTYRjhi</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, relative import may be the issue. Adjusted my answer with info on relative imports.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, doing that just gives me an error. How it is right now it's working and it was working before, now it just gives me a "problem"</span>
