<p>I have several list with dates written as strings in the format "2017-05-22 04:35:00". All lists are ordered. I want to create a new list with dates that are present in ALL other lists.</p>
<p>I have been using the following code:</p>
<pre><code>new_dates = list(set(a)&amp;set(b)&amp;set(c)&amp;set(d))
</code></pre>
<p>Apparently it is working, but the resulting list is not in chronological order anymore. Any idea why this is happening?</p>

<p>Just convert them back to an ordered list when you're done:</p>
<pre><code>new_dates = sorted(set(a) &amp; set(b) &amp; set(c) &amp; set(d))
</code></pre>
