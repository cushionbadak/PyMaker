<p>I am writing a short code in python to automate a process for co-worker. The program is fairly simple, it finds and extracts a list of names from a text file which has a lot of other junk in it. the list can then be easily compared with other lists or put into an excel file etc. </p>
<p>My thought process is that it would be easiest for them to take the file from the source and paste it into a text file on their desktop that my program will automatically locate, read, and ultimately produce a new clean file from. I've been able to manage all of that on my own with my own computer.</p>
<p>When I want to access the original junk-filled text file on my computer I just write:</p>
<pre><code>f = open("/Users/Jon/Desktop/namelisttext.txt", "r+")
</code></pre>
<p>But when I export this program to .exe and send it to a co-worker, this of course won't work because whoever uses it presumably won't have the username "Jon". This seems like it would be a common problem, so I assume there is some easy solution which I haven't been able to find. Is there a way to access the desktop of "current user" or to find a file with a specific name without giving the full path of where it is located? </p>
<p>After some research <a href="http://codevba.com/office/environ.htm#.XHLISNF7nOQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Environ</a> seems like it might be a good solution, which is designed for PC. The work computers are PC, but I am coding on a Mac, so I'm guessing that means I won't be able to test it on my system. </p>
<p>Any help or alternative ways to circumvent the problem are appreciated! </p>

<p>Use <code>~</code> to represent the user's home directory, and then you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.expanduser" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.path.expanduser</code></a> to expand it to the full path for the current user.</p>
<p>If you are logged in as <code>Jon</code> and your home directory is <code>/Users/Jon</code>, then</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import os

print(os.path.expanduser("~/Desktop/namelisttext.txt"))
</code></pre>
<p>Will print:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>/Users/Jon/Desktop/namelisttext.txt
</code></pre>
<p>The great thing about <code>os.path.expanduser</code> is that it's not specific to one OS. It will do the right thing on any OS that Python supports, including Windows, where <code>~</code> is not normally used otherwise.</p>
