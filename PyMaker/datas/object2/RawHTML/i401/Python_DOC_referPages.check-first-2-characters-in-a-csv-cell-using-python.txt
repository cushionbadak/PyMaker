<p><strong>Hi there,</strong></p>
<p>I'm using python to script my program and I am reading data from a CSV file.</p>
<p>1) I would like to check for the first 2 characters in each cell under the "Details" column.</p>
<p>2) I would like to filter my data without cells containing "IP" for the first 2 characters.</p>
<p>Following an example of the 
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DLCDK.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CSV file</a></p>
<p><strong>Thanks in advanced!</strong></p>

<p>Here is a program that you might find helpful. Note how it iterates over the <code>DictReader</code> object and filters lines according to whether the Details field starts with IP.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import csv

with open("input.csv") as input_file:
    with open("output.csv", "w") as output_file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(input_file)
        writer = csv.DictWriter(output_file, fieldnames=reader.fieldnames)
        writer.writeheader()
        for row in reader:
            if not row["Details"].startswith("IP"):
               writer.writerow(row)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the CSV module</a> to parse the contents of your CSV File.</p>
<p>One of the example snippets in the official docs is</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>import csv
with open('some.csv', newline='') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
</code></pre>
<p>From that, all you have to do really is do some string manipulation on <code>row</code> rather than just calling <code>print()</code> on it. If you need help with that, again <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the official docs</a> should prove useful</p>
