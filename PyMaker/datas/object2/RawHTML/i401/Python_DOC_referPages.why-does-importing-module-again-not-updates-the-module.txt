<p>I was going through a tutorial on exception handling and had to write this piece of code in module called exception.py</p>
<pre><code>def convert(s):
    try:
        x = int(s)
        prnit("Conversion done. x=", x)  #there is a typo
    except ValueError:
        print("Failed")
        x = -1
    return x
</code></pre>
<p>then from the REPL i import this function as</p>
<pre><code>from exception import convert
</code></pre>
<p>and do
   convert(7.7)
which returned the <code>NameError: name 'prnit' is not defined</code> as expected.
After which I corrected typo and did <code>from exception import convert</code> again. But the error remained. Why didn't it import new module?</p>
<p>I had to <code>exit()</code> then REPL and import it again then it worked fine and as expected.</p>

<p>Imports are cached in Python, you can read about it in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>There are ways to invalidate the import cache, but it's strongly discouraged.</p>

<p>Pretty easy: the modules are cached, see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>Python documentation</strong></a> on the topic (5.3.1).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It simply caches the imported modules.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well. In short, imported modules are cached in Python.</span>
