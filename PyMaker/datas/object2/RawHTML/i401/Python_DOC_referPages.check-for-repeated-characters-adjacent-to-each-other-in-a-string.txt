<p>I want the user to input a string like this starts and ends with (a), and there are repeated letters in between like this:</p>
<p><em>"abbabbabbabbabba"</em>
the repetition can be: (bb), (bbb), (bbbbb) or more like this:
<em>"abbbabbbabbba"</em> or <em>"abbbbabbbbabbbba"</em> </p>
<p>I managed to check the start and end of the string like this:</p>
<pre><code>input_sentence = input()
    if input_sentence[0] == 'a' and input_sentence[len(input_sentence) - 1] == 'a' :
        print('yes')
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to check the previous values like this:</p>
<pre><code>pass= 'abbabbabba'
prev = ''
for character in pass:
    if character == prev:
       print("repeated character:", character)
    prev = character
</code></pre>
<p>Iut i just can check the repeated letters for one time.</p>
<p>Maybe it is not the right though, but I want to know how to check that a letter in repeated in a specific sequence in a string</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expression</a> to check that the input matches the desired pattern.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; p = r'^(abb+)+a$'
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(p, "abbabbabbabbabba")
&lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 16), match='abbabbabbabbabba'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(p, "abbbabbbabbba")
&lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 13), match='abbbabbbabbba'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(p, "abbbabbbaba")
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>The pattern <code>p</code> matches a string that consists entirely of one or more strings of "a" followed by at least two "b"s, with an "a" at the very end.</p>
<p>The <code>match</code> function will return a match object if the string matches the pattern, otherwise it will return <code>None</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>@f.wue</p>
<p>so should it be like this:</p>
<pre><code>input_sentence = input-sequence.split("a")
if input_sentence.startswith('a') and input_sentence.endswith('a'):
    print('yes')

ex = 'abbabbabbabba'

def check_recursive(character, last_characters):
    sequence = character
    for i in reversed(range(0,len(last_characters))):
        if last_characters[i] == character:
            sequence += last_characters[i]
        else:
        return sequence

outputs = []
for i in reversed(range(1, len(ex))):
    output = check_recursive(ex[i], ex[:i])
    if output != ex[i]:
        outputs.append(output)
if len(set(outputs)) == 1:
    print("Only one type of sequence.")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It's not clear to me what you're asking. The only thing I can suggest for now is that <code>input_sentence[len(input_sentence) - 1]</code> can be simply <code>input_sentence[-1]</code>. You also can't call your variables <code>pass</code> so this should be throwing errors.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. I mean, how can i check that a letter is repeated in a specific manner like this:  (abbabbabba) how to check that bb is repeated through the whole string</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If it is just a and b, I would split on a, and then look at the lengths of the strings of bs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you need to check repetition of a's too?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">first of all; don't use that pass keyword; and secondly; your question is still unclear</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you but just to clarify  for example i write like this:  import re input_sentence = input() p = r'^(abb+)+a$' re.match(p, input_sentence)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@alfredjacob - that looks right, but you need to check the return value from the match function to see whether the string matches the pattern.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@alfredjacob your inputs look very like those used when working with automata in Computer Science courses.  If you're doing a CS course then your professors may prefer that you work out the algorithm from first principles rather than using a regex.  But it's worth knowing that automata and regexes are closely related concepts.  If you're not doing CS course, sorry for the gibberish comment :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@f.wue Is this what you mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I will not edit my post with regard to your question. If your input will always be have an a, see <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp</a> for some tutorial on how to use split.  Please also take the tour to see how stackoverflow works: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tour">stackoverflow.com/tour</a> The goal is not to debug each line of your code, instead answer a specific question where you tried multiple things.</span>
