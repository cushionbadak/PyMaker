<p>My problem - and I don't know why there is a keyword <code>continue</code>, which should leave the value of 3 and go further. In fact, I have a loop that is infinite - that is, it crashes the program.</p>
<pre><code>
tab = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]
i = 0
while i &lt; len(tab):
    print(tab[i])
    if tab[i] == 3:
        continue
    i+=1

</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It looks like you are trying to iterate through the list until you find a <code>3</code> then <code>break</code>. Do something like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>items = [1,2,3,4,5]
for item in items:
   if item == 3:
       break
</code></pre>
<p>The keyword <code>continue</code> will pass to the next iteration of the loop, where <code>break</code> will stop the loop.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>continue</code> keyword continues with the next iteration of the loop.</p>
<p>In your case, it prevents the statement <code>i+=1</code> to be executed.</p>
<p>Here is what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Loops through 0,1,2 just fine</li>
<li>When it evaluates <code>tab[i] = 3</code> it proceeds with the next iteration of the loop and <code>i+=1</code> is never executed, hence <code>i</code> remains 3 and never gets incremented. It keeps doing this forever. </li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to exit the loop, you can use the <code>break</code> statement instead of <code>continue</code>.</p>
<p>For more information, you can read on the <code>continue</code> keyword here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're using the <code>continue</code> keyword, but I think you want <code>break</code>.  </p>
<p>Your code is running forever because <code>i</code> never iterates past 3. Once <code>i == 4</code>, it enters your if statement and continues the loop. Since it continues, it never iterates after that.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because you are using the <code>continue</code> keyword that skips the rest of the code.
Once i reaches 3, it skips over the <code>i+=1</code> command.  It appears that you want to use the keyword <code>break</code>.  You could also do:</p>
<pre><code>for i in tab:
    print(i)
    if i == 3:
        break
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>continue</code> keeps the loop going.  <code>break</code> leaves the loop.</span>
