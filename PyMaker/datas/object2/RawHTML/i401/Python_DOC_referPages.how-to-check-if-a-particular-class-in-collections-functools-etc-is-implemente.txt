<p>I know that many parts of stdlib are implemented in C, e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.OrderedDict</code></a>. Is there a quick way to check if a particular class in <code>collections</code> (<code>functools</code>, etc) is implemented in C? I would expect such implementations to be faster than pure Python.</p>

<p>In the Python docs (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html</a> for functools) you can click the link besides "Source Code" (<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Lib/functools.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.7/Lib/functools.py</a> for functools) and track whatever you want down from there. It's all on the git</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure <code>collections.OrderedDict</code> is implemented in C? I found it's definition <code>class OrderedDict(dict):</code> in <code>/usr/lib/python3.6/collections/__init__.py</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's a bit tricky. For example <code>functools.lru_cache</code> appears to be written in Python at first, but if you look closer it mostly uses <code>_lru_cache_wrapper</code> which is written in C.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sanya yes, since <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html#collections" rel="nofollow noreferrer">3.5</a>.</span>
