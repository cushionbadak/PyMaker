<p>for an assignment, I made a menu and must have it work in a way to execute multiple functions. However, the problem is that when I use the menu and put in an answer that doesn't exist, I cannot get it to work correctly. So when I re-enter an option number for "Incorrect option, try again: ", I do not get the number re-evaluated to execute. Since my code is far from finished, right now I want to be able to choose "4" as an input and get "Incorrect option, try again" as an output and input "1" into this to get the output "Choose the level of difficulty". </p>
<pre><code>def main_menu():
print(10*"=","GAME",10*"=",'\n')
print("1. Choose level of difficulty ")
print("2. Start Game")
print("3. Exit the Game",'\n')
print("Current Difficulty: /5")
print("Highest Score Reached:",'\n')
option=input("Enter an option: ")
return option

def user_input():
while True:
    try:
        if option==1:
            difficulty()
            break 
        elif option==2:
            start()
            break
        elif option==3:
            exit()
            break
    except: 
        option=input("Incorrect option, try again: ")

def difficulty():
 d=int(input("Choose level of difficulty: "))
 if 1&lt;=d&lt;=5:
     start()
 else:
     int(input("Incorrect option, try again: "))
     #difficulty()
 return d
