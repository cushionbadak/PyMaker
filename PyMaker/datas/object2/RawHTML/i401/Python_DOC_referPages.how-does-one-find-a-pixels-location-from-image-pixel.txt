<p>So, i have this script which works, it prints out all the pixels that have and rgb value of (102,102,102) but i don't know how I would be able to now get that pixels location and click it.. any suggestions?    </p>
<p>edit: by pixels location i mean the pixels x,y coordinates</p>
<pre><code>import pyautogui

    pyautogui.click(xc, yc)

gameregion = [71, 378, 328, 530]

foundpxl = 0

xx = 0
while xx &lt;= 300:
    with mss.mss() as sct:
        region = {'top': 0, 'left': 0, 'width': 1920, 'height': 1080}
        imgg = sct.grab(region)
        pxls = imgg.pixels


        for pxl in pxls:
            for pxll in pxl:
                if pxll == (102, 102, 102) or pxl == "(255, 255, 255)" or pxl == [255, 255, 255]:
                    foundpxl = pxll
                    print(foundpxl)

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong><code>enumerate</code></strong></a> any sequence you iterate over. This returns the index of the element and the element:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i, e in enumerate('abc'):
...     print(i, e)
0 a
1 b
2 c
</code></pre>
<p>So, you can make use of this to find the row and column of the pixel:</p>
<pre><code>for row, pxl in enumerate(pxls):
    for col, pxll in enumerate(pxl):
        ...
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Mmmm... you have a list of pixels (presumably several pixels if it's a list) and you want to click on it (presumably one pixel, else you would say <i>"them"</i>)... Which is it please? Is there a list or just one?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok, so this isn't exactly what i needed, i should have explained better, I need to find pxl's x and y coordinates, how may i do this, if possible with my for loop?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>x</code> is <code>col</code>, <code>y</code> is <code>row</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks! :) sorry im new to python</span>
