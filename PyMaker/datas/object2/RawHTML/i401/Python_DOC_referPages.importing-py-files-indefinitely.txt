<p>i'm a newcomer to python, and i would like to try moving from one file to another, like looping through fileA then fileB indefinitely. However, when i tried to use the import function, the files only import each other once, then stop. is there a way to import the whole file multiple times?</p>
<p>FileA:</p>
<pre><code>story1 = "You see a statue of a metal man peeking out of a building. A park is just across the street.\n\nPossible exits: north."
map_legend = "\nMap Legend:\nG   you\n.   clear path\n-|  wall\n+   door\n"
map1 = "-.\n |G\n-//\n|.|\n---"

while True:
    print(story1)
    action = input(str())
    while action != 'north':
            print ('there is nothing there.')
            action = input(str())
    ***import story2***
    continue
</code></pre>
<p>FileB:</p>
<pre><code>story2 = "You see a map on the bench. Type 'grab' to pick it up.\n\nPossible exits: north and south."
map_legend = "\nMap Legend:\nG   you\n.   clear path\n-|  wall\n+   door\n"
map1 = "-.\n |G\n-//\n|.|\n---"
inventory=list()
action = 'north'

while True:
    print(map_legend,"\n",map1,"\n")
    direction = f"you moved {action}."
    print(direction)
    print(story2)
    action = input(str())
    while action != 'north' and action != 'south' and action != 'grab':
        print ('there is nothing there.')
        action = input(str())
    if action == 'grab':
        inventory.append('1 map')
        print ("Inventory:\n1 map")
        action = input(str())
    while action != 'north' and action != 'south':
        print ('there is nothing there.')
        action = input(str())
    if action == 'south':
        direction = f"you moved {action}."
        print(direction)
        ***import story1***
        continue
</code></pre>
<p>So, there was no problem moving from fileA to fileB, but after moving from fileB to fileA, i couldn't "import" fileB anymore. Is the "import" function being used wrongly here?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>The solution is to put the code that you want to re-use in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">functions</a>, then you can call the functions repeatedly do do what you want.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>A.py</p>
<pre><code>def do_thing():
    # some code

def do_other_thing():
    # more code
</code></pre>
<p>B.py</p>
<pre><code>import A

while True:
    A.do_thing()
    A.do_other_thing()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Define a function in fileA and fileB. Use these files with their function to import in your module and create a loop which calls each other. But, this is not a good way to go for.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should use def() to do this. so for file a your code would be</p>
<pre><code>def fileA():
    story1 = "You see a statue of a metal man peeking out of a building. A park is just across the street.\n\nPossible exits: north."
    map_legend = "\nMap Legend:\nG   you\n.   clear path\n-|  wall\n+   door\n"
    map1 = "-.\n |G\n-//\n|.|\n---"

    while True:
        print(story1)
        action = input(str())
        while action != 'north':
                print ('there is nothing there.')
                action = input(str())
        ***import story2***
        continue
</code></pre>
<p>You should then put your function for file a and b in the same python file and run using <code>fileA()</code> and <code>fileB()</code>. All in one python file.</p>
<p>If you want to call it from another python file you will have to do <code>import filea.py</code> and then run <code>filea.fileA()</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Rather than writing your code directly in the <code>.py</code> file, each file should define a <em>function</em> (using the <code>def</code> keyword). Then you can <code>import</code> the functions from those files and call them one after another, in a loop.</p>
<p>That said, if you <em>really</em> want to re-import the module (instead of just reusing the existing module object, which the <code>import</code> statement does), you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>importlib.reload</code></a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Despite it's not an answer to your question - i strongly believe that constant loop of importing two files is not the best logic to make an app. If you want to use code from another file - it's better to make some functions in this files and use them when you need.</span>
