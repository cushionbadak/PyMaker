<p>I'm trying to install packages in Python using pip3.  I've definitely managed to install these packages on other systems, so I know they exist.  But it's as if the pip3 repository I'm using doesn't contain then.  The packages are shelve and os.  The error I get is along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>    [root@host]# pip3 install shelve
Collecting shelve
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement shelve (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for shelve
</code></pre>
<p>I'm using RHEL 7 if that makes any difference.</p>

<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/shelve/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The project</a> has one release in 2011 and the release doesn't have downloadable files. Not a useable project by all accounts.</p>
<p>Do you mean <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shelve.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shelve from the stdlib</a>? You don't need to install it, it's always available, just import it.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-tk; if you have python installed
</code></pre>
