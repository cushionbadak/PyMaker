<p>The code creates a random addition problem and spits out "Congratulations" if correct and "sorry...." if the inputted value is wrong. The while loop repeats this process until the user inserts "N" for the question "continue (Y/N):, at the same time it keeps track of how many questions have been answered, and which ones are correct. The code works fine, my problem is it has repetitive code. I was wondering if there is a way to shrink it.  </p>
<p>**I appreciate everyone one's help and advice. I"m a noob that's just learning python  **  </p>

<p>A first start, would be eliminating the code before the <code>while</code>, by initializing the count variable (which keeps track of the turns), in zero, and allowing the while loop to run the first turn, we just need to have a variable like <code>want_to_play</code> and by default it's <code>True</code>, so the first time we'll be playing, and at the end of the game If I don't input <code>Y</code> or <code>y</code> it will asume I don't want to play any more and set the variable to false, that way I can have all the turns ran by the while loop. </p>
<p>and you'll be getting something like this.: </p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>from random import sample

correct = 0
count = 0           # STartint in turn zero
want_to_play = True # Control Variable

while want_to_play:
    count += 1 
    # First turn this is zero, and adds one.

    [num1, num2] = sample(range(0, 101), 2)
    # Just another way of getting two random numbers from 1 up to (including) 100.
    # Printing could be done in one line. 
    print(format(num1, '5d') + '\n+' + format(num2, '4d'))
    answer = int(input('= '))
    # The comparison really doesn't really hurt if you do it this way. 
    if answer == num1 + num2:
        print('Congraulations!')
        correct += 1
    else:
        print('Sorry the correct answer is', sum)

    # you decide.

<p>By initializing the variable c as "Y", the condition is met and the loop can be executed:</p>
<pre><code>import random

    num1=random.randint(0,100)

<p>I also added the method <code>upper()</code> to the Y/N input so the user can also type it in lowercase</p>

<p>Try to move as much of the processing as possible into the loop.  The first "paragraph" of your code was basically a duplicate of the main-loop.  By creating the continuation variable <code>c</code> so that it drops straight into the loop, most of that first block could be removed.</p>
<pre><code>import random

correct=0
count=0
c = 'Y'

while c == "Y":

    count+=1

    c=input('Continue (Y/N):')

    print('Your final score is',correct,'/',count)
</code></pre>
<p>The two formula printing statements can also be reduced to a single one:</p>
<pre><code>    print(format(num1,'4d'))
    print('+',num2)
</code></pre>
<p>could be</p>
<pre><code>    print( format(num1,'4d') + '+', num2 )
</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>sum</code> could be removed, but it does make the code self-documenting, which is a good thing.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Write the repetitive parts into functions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you provide an example please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I recommend going through an interactive tutorial of Python first to get familiar with all the basic constructs. This seemed to explain your case in detail: <a href="https://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorial</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would advise against using a variable with the name sum, as it shadows the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=sum#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built-in function</a> with the same name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok thanks for the suggestion</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you so much I was at this for ages lol</span>
