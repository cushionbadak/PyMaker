<p>I have a code that analyses certain excel file named "biotic", how can I make code to use the latest "biotic(n)" file that exists or to choose the newest file containing word "biotic" in the folder?</p>
<pre><code>Excel = pd.read_excel('C:/Users/Downloads/biotic.xls')
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can use the python library Glob to accomplish what you want to do here. The following code gives you the latest .xls file in your Downloads folder</p>
<pre><code>import glob
import os

files = glob.glob('C:/Users/Downloads/biotic*.xls')
new = max(files, key=os.path.getctime)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I think the point is the OP doesn't know what particular file to useâ€”so doubt this would be very helpful by itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah gotcha, I'll edit my answer in that case. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hint: You could select the file in the returned list and use the one with the latest/largest creation timestamp.</span>
