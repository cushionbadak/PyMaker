<p>I have a Python script which reads some data from a file using shell redirection, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>python script.py &lt; input.txt
</code></pre>
<p>After the file is processed, I want to allow the user to enter some parameters from the terminal. How can I do this?</p>
</div>

<p>Redirection lasts until the process terminates. So you can't do what you want. Instead, specify your input file using a command line argument, like this:</p>
<pre><code>python script.py --input input.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>argparse</code> to pick the name out of the command line and read it like an ordinary file. That will leave <code>sys.stdin</code> free to do the interactive things you want with <code>input()</code>.</p>

<p>As you have tagged the question with <code>bash</code>, I think I can speak of the trick that consist of explicitely opening <code>/dev/tty</code>. This is normally only used for programs asking <em>secrets</em> that should never live in a file. But that would allow to read from the terminal even after starting a script with a redirected stdin.</p>
<p>Anyway, except for <strong>very</strong> special use case, I strongly advice to use a command line parameter instead, to allow the program to read from the specified file, and then normally read from stdin.</p>
