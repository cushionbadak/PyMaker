<p>I need to write the outputs to a json file in python.
I have tried some of the answers here to write to a json file but for some reason I am not finding the correct format I need the data written to a json file.</p>
<p>What I am looking at is:</p>
<pre><code>{
  {
  "Region": "BD",
  "name": "bdfe",
  "tyl": "cya",
  "ice": "messi",
  "fed": "bet",
   },
   {
  "Region": "Toron",
  "name": "Cana",
  "tyl": "cyab",
  "ice": "feed",
  "fed": "not",
   },
  ...

}
</code></pre>
<p>How can I write in this format in python?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Firstly, your 'json' is wrong. I'm assuming the outer curly brackets should be square brackets and you thus trying to save a list. Sets are not part of the json format. 
Assuming <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/12309296/1035279">this answer</a> is not what you want because the output is not formatted, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a> to format the file as you need it.

<p>Replicating that code in python is very simple. All you have to do is convert that to a dictionary. Here is the converted output:</p>
<pre><code>import json


mydict = [{
"Region": "BD",
"name": "bdfe",
"tyl": "cya",
"ice": "messi",
"fed": "bet",
 },
 {
"Region": "Toron",
"name": "Cana",
"tyl": "cyab",
"ice": "feed",
"fed": "not",
 }]

with open('data.json', 'w') as out: 
    json.dump(mydict, out, indent = 2)

<span class="comment-copy">That is so descriptive. Thx.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was working on a chat-bot and needed that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@XilpexThank you, but how do I write this to a json file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">printing <code>dicts</code> is not <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSON</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@LohmarASHAR had misunderstood the question, and am sorry for that. I have edited it to fit the question.</span>
