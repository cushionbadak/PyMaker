<p>The code should finds. But i get the error:</p>
<p>ValueError. can somebody please help me with a solution? thanks. </p>
<pre><code>integers.close() # closes the file

<p>The problem is the reading the file or each line of the file provides a String type line, your program doesn't handle the input in the proper way.
If you want you code to work you should do:</p>
<pre><code>integers = open('/home/user/Documents/number.txt', 'r')
biggest = float('-inf')
smallest = float('inf')

for line in integers:
    for number in line.split(' '): # Splitting the line counting on spacing between numbers
        curr = int(number) # Casting each string to an integer type
        if biggest &lt; curr:
            biggest = curr
        if smallest &gt; curr:
            smallest = curr

integers.close()  # closes the file

# print results
print(smallest, biggest)

<p>If you want to read/write files in Python I'd recommend using a file handler,you can read further <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the example here I've:</p>
<ul>
<li>opened the files and read all the lines to a list</li>
<li>Using list comprehension I've build a list of the numbers</li>
<li>Using Python build-in math function max and min I've printed them from the list. </li>
</ul>
<p>The Code:   </p>
<pre><code>    with open('number.txt', 'r') as txtfile:
        numbers_list = txtfile.readlines()
    numbers = [int(num) for curr_line in numbers_list for num in curr_line.split(' ')]
    print(min(numbers), max(numbers))
</code></pre>

<p>Your problem, is caused by wrong processing of content you readed from file.
To discard newline character (<code>\n</code>) from end of line you can use <code>.rstrip('\n')</code> method, example:</p>
<pre><code>x = '1 2 3\n'
y = x.rstrip('\n')
print(y)
</code></pre>
<p>will print:
<code>1 2 3</code> (without newline)</p>
<p>Alternatively you could use <code>.splitlines()</code> method, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>file = open('numbers.txt','r')
data = file.read().splitlines()
file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>In this case <code>data</code> would be <code>list</code> of <code>str</code>s, each representing one line of file. You would need to use <code>.split(' ')</code> method to get particular numbers and <code>int</code> to convert from <code>str</code> to <code>int</code>, for example:</p>
<pre><code>a = '1 2 3'
b = [int(i) for i in a.split(' ')]
print(b) #prints [1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>After getting correct <code>list</code> of <code>int</code>s, you might implement own <em>min</em> or <em>max</em> finding.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your problem is that you have spaces in your number, and a trailing <code>\n</code> :) It's also a redicilously large number. So do <code>int(line.strip().replace(' ', ''))</code> and it should work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Although the code shown may be "correct", the OP might be unfamiliar with the method/function you've added (e.g. <code>.split()</code> or <code>open</code>). However, without explanation, this only encourages a "give me teh codez" behaviour. As a suggestion on writing a better answer, please elaborate (or link the OP to appropriate/helpful documentation for further reading) on the changes you've made to the OP's code and in solving his issue. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was editing my answer and accidentally pressed post, though your comment is correct it's just not the case here :)</span>
