<p>I have the following function declaration:</p>
<pre><code>def set_data(obj=None, name='delp', type=None):
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a python shortcut, where type is equal with 'name' value(default r passed) if is None ?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The usual idiom is:</p>
<pre><code>def set_data(obj=None, name='delp', type=None):
    if type is None:
        type = name
</code></pre>
<p>(But don't actually use <code>type</code> as a variable name, it'll mask the built in function as described here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10568087/is-it-safe-to-use-the-python-word-type-in-my-code">Is it safe to use the python word "type" in my code?</a>)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Don't use <code>reserved words</code>, for your own sake (and probably everyone else working with your code), please :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It could be just <code>type = type or name</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sraw note that this will assign the default if the variable is <b>any</b> false-y value, not just <code>None</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sraw - that's not identical in behavior. The empty string is not <code>None</code> but it is false, just for one example. If you want to be as concise as possible, a conditional expression (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/â€¦</a>) is one alternative.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PeterDeGlopper Correct, but as here type seems to be a string. And there are only two kinds of false values: empty string or <code>None</code>. It could be enough. Although I admit it is not enough for many other situations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sraw an equivalent one liner would be <code>type = name if type is None else type</code></span>
