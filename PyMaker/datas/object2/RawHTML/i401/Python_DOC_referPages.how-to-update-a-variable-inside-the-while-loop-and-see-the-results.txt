<p>I want to use a for loop to define a range and I would like to use a while loop to check a condition for every value inside this for loop and give me the results for different values of c, but unfortunately, my algorithm doesn't work and I don't know what my mistake is.</p>
<pre><code>j=0
jl=[]
c=np.linspace(0,20,num=20)
for a in range(0,len(c)):
    while j&lt;5:
        j=c[a]+2
    jl.append(j)
</code></pre>
<p>The result I am looking for is it puts different values of c inside the while loop and calculate j and check if it is bigger than 5 or not. if yes, it appends it to jl. Totally, I want to define a range with for loop with index and also check each value of this range inside while loop and get the results for j.
so expected results are j with values smaller than 5 (c[a]+2&lt;5) and store the values of j in jl</p>

<p>There is one problem in your code: </p>
<pre><code>j=0
</code></pre>
<p>"While loop" never runs because his condition is j&gt;5. Correct that and tell us if it works. </p>

<p>Please double check if the following suggested solution covers all of your requirements. In any case I think <em>List Comprehensions</em> (e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> compare section 5.1.3.</a>) can help you.</p>
<pre><code>c=np.linspace(0,20,num=20)
ls = [x+2 for x in c if((x+2)&lt;5)]
print(ls)
</code></pre>
<p>Will result in the following output:</p>
<pre><code>[2.0, 3.052631578947368, 4.105263157894736]
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to do more complex data manipulation, you can also do this with the help of functions, e.g. like:</p>
<pre><code>def someManipulation(x):
    return x+2

ls = [someManipulation(x) for x in c if(someManipulation(x)&lt;5)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your algorithm doesn't work because</p>
<pre><code>while j&lt;5:
    j=c[a]+2
</code></pre>
<p>is an infinite loop for j = 0, a = 0.</p>
<p>What you probably wanted to write was:</p>
<pre><code>for x in c:
    j = x + 2
    if j &lt; 5:
        jl.append(j)
</code></pre>
<p>Still, the list comprehension version in the other answer does exactly the same, but better.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You start with <code>j=0</code> and your while condition is <code>j&gt;5</code> so it never runs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wwii sorry i wrote down wrongly here, i corrected it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your example has <code>jl.append(j)</code> <i>outside/after</i> the for loop - is that intended? - it will only run once after the for loop is done.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wwii actually I am new in programming, especially python, that's why I am not aware of my mistakes, this task is very important for me because I am going to write a program in the university. Actually, I don't know where should i put this append right now. I didn't get any results.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't actually need the range here, because you never try to <i>assign</i> to <code>c[a]</code> or  use <code>a</code> for anything other than indexing <code>c</code>. Just iterate over <code>c</code> directly: <code>for item in c: while j &lt; 5: j=item + 2; ...</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Bellaiche I corrected it but still no result...</span>
