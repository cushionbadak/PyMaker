<p>okay, this may have been talked about before, but I am unable to find it anywhere on stack so here i am. </p>
<p>Basically I am writing a script that will take a .txt document and store every other line (even lines say) and print them into a new text document. </p>
<p>I was able to successfully write my code to scan the text and remove the even numbered lines and put them into a list as independent variables but when i got to add each item of the list to the new text documents, depending on where i do that i get either the first line or the last line but never more than one.</p>
<p>here is what i have </p>
<pre><code>f = open('stuffs.txt', 'r')
i = 1
x = []
for line in f.readlines():
    if i % 2 == 0:
        x.append(line)
    i += 1  
</code></pre>
<p>I have tested that this successfully takes the proper lines and stores them in list x</p>
<p>i have tried </p>
<pre><code>for m in x:
    t = open('stuffs2.txt','w')
    t.write(m)
</code></pre>
<p>directly after, and it only prints the last line</p>
<p>if i do </p>
<pre><code>for line in f.readlines():
    if i % 2 == 0:
        t = open('stuffs2.txt','w') 
        t.write(line)
    i += 1
</code></pre>
<p>it will print the first line</p>
<p>if i try to add the first solution to the for loop as a nested for loop it will also print the first line. I have no idea why it is not taking each individual item and putting it in the .txt
when i print the list it is in there as it should be.</p>

<p>Did look for a canonical - did not find one...</p>

<p><code>open('stuffs2.txt','w')</code>  - "w" == kill whats there and open new empty file ... </p>
<p>Read the documentation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reading-and-writing-files</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>7.2. Reading and Writing Files</strong><br/>
<code>open()</code> returns a file object, and is most commonly used with two arguments: <code>open(filename, mode)</code>. <code>f = open('workfile', 'w'</code>) </p>
<p>The first argument is a string containing the filename. </p>
<p>The second argument is another string
  containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will
  be used. </p>
<p><code>mode</code> can be <strong><code>'r'</code></strong> when the file will only be read, <strong><code>'w'</code></strong> for only
  writing (<strong>an existing file with the same name will be erased</strong>), and <strong><code>'a'</code></strong>
  opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is
  automatically added to the end. <strong><code>'r+'</code></strong> opens the file for both reading
  and writing. The mode argument is optional; <code>'r'</code> will be assumed if
  itâ€™s omitted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To write every 2nd line more economically:</p>
<pre><code>with open("file.txt") as f, open("target.txt","w") as t:
    write = True
    for line in f:
        if write:
            t.write(line)
        write = not write
</code></pre>
<p>this way you do not need to store all lines in memory.    </p>
<p>The <code>with open(...) as name :</code>  syntax is also better - it will close your filehandle (which you do not do) even if exceptions arise.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the information, yeah I completely forgot that w will erase everything. haha I was getting so frustrated. In your code, if you do not have a file already created for the <code>"target.txt"</code> then it will throw an error, to create a new file, i had to put <code>open("target.txt","a")</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@B goodpoint - I added "w" there now - creating  it once should be ok</span>
