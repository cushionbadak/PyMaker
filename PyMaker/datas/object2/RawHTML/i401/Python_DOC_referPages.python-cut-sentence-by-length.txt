<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a big sentence and a length. How do I cut my sentence so that it doesn't exceed my length and put the rest of the sentence on a new line with a space as delimiter. This for example can't exceed my length of 15:</p>
<pre><code>This sentence is way too long.
</code></pre>
<p>So I have to become:</p>
<pre><code>This sentence
is way too
long.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The standard library has the <code>textwrap</code> module for jobs like this.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import textwrap
&gt;&gt;&gt; print('\n'.join(textwrap.wrap("This sentence is way too long.", 15)))
This sentence
is way too
long.
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">what should happen if a single word is longer than 15 chars?</span>
