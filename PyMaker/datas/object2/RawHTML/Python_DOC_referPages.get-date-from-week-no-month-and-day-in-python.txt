<p>I have a date variable:</p>
<pre><code>temp_date = '2019-03-15'
</code></pre>
<p>          
I've calculated the <code>week no. of the month</code> and <code>day</code> using datetime:</p>
<p>I got <strong>week_no = 3</strong> and <strong>day = 'Friday'</strong>.</p>
<p>I want to find what date it was in February,January and december for the same week-day combination.</p>
<p>i.e:  date for February,Week3,Friday(Ans: 2019-02-15) &amp; </p>
<p>date for January,Week3,Friday(Ans: 2019-01-18).</p>
<p>date for December,Week3,Friday(Ans: 2018-12-14)
          </p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<pre><code>feb= (current_date + timedelta(weeks=4)).strftime ('%d-%m-%Y')
jan= (current_date + timedelta(weeks=8)).strftime ('%d-%m-%Y')
dec= (current_date + timedelta(weeks=12)).strftime ('%d-%m-%Y')
</code></pre>
<p>I got Jan and Feb dates correctly but for december i got (2018-12-21).</p>
<p>Is there a better way of doing this?</p>

<p>This took a while, using <code>isoweek</code> along with <code>monthrange</code> from <code>calendar</code> should do it:</p>
<pre><code>from isoweek import Week
import datetime
from calendar import monthrange

year = 2019
weekDay = 3
jan_date = Week(year, weekDay).friday()

Feb = monthrange(year, 2)[1]   # 28 Days for 2nd month
Mar = monthrange(year, 3)[1]   # 31 Days for 3rd month
Apr = monthrange(year, 4)[1]   # 30 Days for 4th month

feb_date = jan_date + datetime.timedelta(days=Feb)
mar_date = feb_date + datetime.timedelta(days=Mar)
apr_date = mar_date + datetime.timedelta(days=Apr)

print(feb_date)   # Feb 28 Days
print(mar_date)   # Mar 31 Days
print(apr_date)   # Apr 30 Days
</code></pre>
<p><strong>OUTPUT</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>2019-02-15
2019-03-18
2019-04-17

<span class="comment-copy">Is this your actual code? You are adding the <code>timedelta</code> instead of subtracting it. If you are after December 2019, you should add 40 weeks instead of subtracting 12.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your premise is wrong if you're expecting <code>2018-12-14</code> to pop up. If you want the <i>third Friday of the month</i>, then December 21 is that. December 14 is the second, December 7 is the first, and November 30 was the Friday before that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GreenCloakGuy Did you mean November 30?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Selcuk ~You fool, everyone knows November doesn't exist!~ *fixed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GreenCloakGuy I thought it was Australia that didn't exist but I may be wrong.</span>
