<p>I am trying to install mitmproxy on a Raspberry Pi, but getting the below issues, which I believe are related to Python. I have tried numerous attempts and searches but no luck at all.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is due to dependencies with libraries need by mitmproxy or else the python installation I have which I built a number of times. </p>
<p>I also attemtpted to use Wifi pumpkin, however this also makes use of mitmproxy which once again due to a dependency on Python I was unable to install. Any other tools were I can MITM traffic coming from a device to the internet? ( I am doing this as part of my dissertation)</p>
