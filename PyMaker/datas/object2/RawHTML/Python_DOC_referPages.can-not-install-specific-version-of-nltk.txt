<p>for a specific reason I need to install nltk 2.09b in python 2.7 version. But whenever I execute the following command, </p>
<pre><code>pip2 install nltk==2.0b9
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following error: </p>
<pre><code>Collecting nltk==2.0b9

    Complete output from command python setup.py egg_info:

</code></pre>
<p>But if I run without any version specification I don't get an error. like the following: </p>
<pre><code>pip2 install nltk;
</code></pre>
<p>How can I solve this issue?</p>

<p>First thing: using anaconda, you probably have a recent enough pip and setuptools and should use conda itself to update those. With anaconda, conda install is the primary resource for installing anaconda-provided packages. Then, "2.0b9" is a beta release (as indicated by the "b9") and might suffer from a configuration problem for the install. The setup.py file is not located at the root of the downloaded archive file, I suppose that creates the problem.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried downloading the .tar.gz, extracting it and then doing <code>python2 setup.py install</code> in the extracted directory, i.e. performing a manual installation?</span>
