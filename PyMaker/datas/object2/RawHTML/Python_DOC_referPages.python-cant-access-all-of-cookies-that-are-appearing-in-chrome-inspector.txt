<p>I created the cookies using JavaScript, the page is then reloaded and I retrieve the cookies with Python, but the only cookie that is retrieved is the session cookie.</p>
<p>Adding Cookie:</p>

<p>I figured it out. I was supposed to use <code>request.cookie</code> in python to retrieve the cookie since I'm using Flask. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">The JavaScript doesn't run when you use <code>requests</code>, it only gets cookies that are actually set by the server on the response.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am confused by your answer. The JavaScript is ran because the cookies are apparent in the chrome inspector. If the JavaScript wasn't ran, than there would not be any cookie that has the word "byte" at the beginning of it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why would that have any bearing on it? They're <i>only</i> set in the browser, client-side. Python makes a separate request to the <i>server</i>. What are you actually trying to <i>achieve</i> here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's clear. It's unclear what problem you're actually trying to solve by setting random cookies in the browser, or by accessing them from Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">...so why are you trying to load them with <code>requests</code>? Do you need those strings server-side? You can work with them client-side using JavaScript from the cookies you already have, but if you need them on the server you should be sending them there. If you don't want to use URL parameters you can POST them.</span>
