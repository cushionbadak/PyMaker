<p>The print(i) is there to check that it's working properly but all it prints is the first letter from whatever the user inputs as their name. The purpose is so that if someone were for example to accidentally type a number in their name (any symbol not included in the list characters) that it returns "ERROR! Invalid entry." and prompts them to enter their name again.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong and how can I go through each letter from the input to ensure it's a valid entry?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>You need to remove <code>return first_name</code>. You should never call a return unless the function has finished 100%. Here you are calling it on the first loop iteration, meaning the function will finish after checking the first character in the first name.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Try removing <code>return first_name</code> from the if-statement, and putting it outside of the for-loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">First, <code>characters</code> should be a set, for O(1) lookup, second, you are returning after the first iteration of your loop if the user has entered a valid character.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is perfect, thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This never actually returns the validated input, which is presumably the point of the function.</span>
