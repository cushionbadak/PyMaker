<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have following code:</p>
<pre><code>if sys.argv[2].isdigit() and sys.argv[3].isdigit() and sys.argv[2] &gt;='3' and sys.argv[3] &gt;='3':
    print 'works'
else:
    sys.exit()
</code></pre>
<p>it's works, but I try to find a way how to make "if sys.argv[2].isdigit() and sys.argv[3].isdigit() and sys.argv[2] &gt;='3' and sys.argv[3] &gt;='3':" shorter and more beautiful. Is there any way to reach this? Thx!</p>

<p>This is a nice, expandable condition to replace yours:</p>
<pre><code>all(map(lambda x: x.isdigit() and int(x) &gt; 3, sys.argv[2:4]))
</code></pre>
<p>This will be true if all elements of <code>sys.argv[2:4]</code> are numbers greater than 3. This might also be overkill for checking two numbers, but this is much more readable than checking everything separately and it should be abundantly clear to anyone who reads this what you are trying to do.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What if the <code>arg</code>s contain multi-digit strings? Can you first clarify what the problem is you want to solve?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>"12" &gt;= '3'</code> is <code>False</code>, for example.  Is this what you intend?  If not, casting the values to <code>int</code>s (and catching any errors) is probably nicer than doing string comparisons.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>argparse</code></a> module instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Iguananaut: although that is in general a good idea, I think here it is rather overkill if we only want to check two numbers. Since parsing it requires writing extra logic as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@WillemVanOnsem can you give me an example?</span>
