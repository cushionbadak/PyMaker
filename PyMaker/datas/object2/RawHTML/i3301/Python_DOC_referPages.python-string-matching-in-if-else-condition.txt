<p>I am currently trying to find line based on the same pattern. If the line match the pattern, i want to print the line in output file.</p>
<p>Here is one the example of the line in "in.txt":</p>
<pre><code>in_file [0:2] declk
out_file [0:1] subclk
</code></pre>
<p>The script that i currently have with the help of @gilch:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
import re
with open("in.txt", "r+") as f:
    with open("out.txt, "w+") as fo:
    for line in f:   
        if "\S*\s*[\d:\d]\s*\S*" in line:
            fo.write(line) #need to fix this line 
</code></pre>
<p>But then, is it possible to make the output like below:
e.g<br/>
Output in "out.txt":</p>
<pre><code>in_file [0] declk
in_file [1] declk
in_file [2] declk
out_file [0] subclk
out_file [1] subclk
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You'll need to import the <code>re</code> module to use regex.</p>
<pre><code>import re
with open("out.txt", "w+") as fo:
    for line in f:   
        if re.match(r"\S*\s*\[-?\d*:?-?\d*\]\s*\S*", line):
            fo.write(line)
</code></pre>
<p>Also, indentation is part of Python's syntax. The colon isn't enough.</p>
<p>This also assumes that <code>f</code> is already some iterable containing your lines. (The above code never assigns to it.)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>import re
with open("out.txt", "w+") as fo:
    for line in f:   
        if re.match(r"\w+\s\[\d\:\d\]\s\w+",line):
            fo.write(line)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The fact that you're not getting any output means none of the lines contain <code>S*\s*[\d:\d]\s*\S*</code>. Your example line certainly does not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there any way can i get it to match?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">missed a quote there</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For RegEx work I recommend using an online regex tester with your Regular Expression and samples to rule out problems in the RegEx itself. Just a "by the way"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bernhard thanks for the suggestion, the tester really help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Escape the square brackets</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OlivierMelan√ßon yep, fixed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what does the * do in this expression ????</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Inder see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star</a>  and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=repetitions#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regex syntax</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks a lot @gilch</span>
