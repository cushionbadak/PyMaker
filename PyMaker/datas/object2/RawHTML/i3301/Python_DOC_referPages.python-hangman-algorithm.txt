<p>So when i was programming a simple hangman game for fun, because of the beginner i am i still need help on things:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I want my algorithm to test whether an input has only one character for example:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
  x=str(input())
  #code checking wheather it is only one character, if it is  
  character break and stop the loop, 
  otherwise repeat the input
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Let's say my secret word is <code>'billy'</code>
I would want to know how to how to check whether this one letter input has the same letter as any of those in the secret word. for e.g</p>
<pre><code>if x *code checking if the input has a same letter as the secret word*:
  #carry on program
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>If you can help me with either of these two problems you'd be a lifesaver! </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use if in when checking. So you get the input and then you would use code like the following:</p>
<pre><code>if x in secret_word:
  #carry on with the program
</code></pre>
<p>To check for it having one character use len. So</p>
<pre><code>if len(x)==1:
  #carry on
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>len</code></a> funtion and the <code>in</code> operator are what you're looking for.  You should consider reading though the python tutorial to get a grasp on the basic tools of the language. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html</a></span>
