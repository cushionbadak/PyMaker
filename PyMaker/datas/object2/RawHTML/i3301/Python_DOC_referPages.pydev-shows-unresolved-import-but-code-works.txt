<p>I am using Pydev on Eclipse.</p>
<p>This is my code</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
from urllib.request import urlopen
from http.client import RemoteDisconnected

xl_sheet = pd.read_excel('sample.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1')
for i in xl_sheet.index:
    web_url = xl_sheet['Web'][i]

    if isinstance(web_url, str):
        if 'http://' not in web_url:
            web_url = 'http://' + web_url
        print(web_url)

        try:
            code = urlopen(web_url).getcode()
        except RemoteDisconnected:
            print('not working')
</code></pre>
<p>Pydev shows <code>unresolved import</code> for <code>from http.client import RemoteDisconnected</code> this line. But when I run the code, it works (It prints <code>not working</code> for few of the sites that are down). What could be wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Please try adding <code>http.client</code> to the forced builtins to see if it fixes your problem.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is it possible that you have two Pythons installed, say a 3.4 and 3.5, and PyDev is configured to check your code against the 3.4 standard library, but you run your code under the 3.5? Because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.RemoteDisconnected" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>RemoteDisconnceted</code></a> was added in 3.5.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert I am using a virtualenv for this project and the interpreter set for this project is the one for that with no external files added to PYTHONPATH. Also, grammar is same as interpreter</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nope. It does'nt</span>
