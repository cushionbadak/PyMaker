<p>I am trying to copy a word file from an existing folder and copying it to a new output folder. In this output folder, I have again created different folders as per the user id and inside this the word file should be placed for every user. However, while copying this, I am facing an issue as the id folder is interpreted as 
a file. The output file picture is attached here:</p>
<p><img alt="the output file picture is attached here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WmGHR.png"/></p>
<p>I am using the <code>shutil</code> module for this and the code which I wrote is:</p>
<pre><code>id = tup2[i] 
shutil.copy('C:\\Python27\\mydoc.docx', ('C:\\Python27\\Output\\%s') %(id))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>that's expected. If the destination folder exists, then <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>copy</code></a> appends the basename of your file and copies the file into the destination folder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Copies the file src to the <strong>file or directory</strong> dst. src and dst should be strings. <strong>If dst specifies a directory, the file will be copied into dst using the base filename from src</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If it doesn't, then <code>copy</code> assumes that you want to <em>copy and change the name</em> (the unix <code>cp</code> commands works exactly the same).</p>
<p>A workaround would be to create the directory beforehand/ensure it's here:</p>
<pre><code>import os,shutil
output_dir = os.path.join(r'C:\Python27\Output',str(id))
if not os.path.isdir(output_dir):
    os.mkdir(output_dir)
shutil.copy(r'C:\Python27\mydoc.docx', output_dir)
</code></pre>
<p>(it's also better to use proper path handling functions from <code>os.path</code> and raw strings for litteral windows paths)</p>
