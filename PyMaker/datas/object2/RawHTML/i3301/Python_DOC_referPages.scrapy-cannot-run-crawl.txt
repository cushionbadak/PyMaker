<p>I was running Scrapy on a very simple example code(shown below, from a tutorial website ) to test if it is set up correctly.</p>
<p>The code I copied:</p>
<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import scrapy

class RedditbotSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'redditbot'
    allowed_domains = ['www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/']
    start_urls = ['http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones//']

    def parse(self, response):
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>When I ran the following command</p>
<pre><code>scrapy crawl redditbot
</code></pre>
<p>the following errors happened</p>
<p><img alt="The errors" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eJXrw.png"/></p>
<p>I am not sure what's happening and seeking for help on setting up scrapy correctly.</p>

<p>Long story short, this is a bug with Twisted for Python 3.7--not Scrapy at all. Scrapy is more of a framework than a stand-alone Python module. Scrapy itself imports a ton of modules that it uses--one of those being Twisted. So, bugs can happen with any number of modules it uses.</p>
<p>You are running Python 3.7 which currently is the newest of the new. Not all modules will support Python 3.7 perfectly right away; hence this is the case with Twisted trying to use the new <code>async</code> keyword that is brand new to Python 3.7. See:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html</a></p>
<p>I would recommend installing Python 3.6 for now; then <code>pip</code> or <code>pipenv</code> will only install the versions of modules that are more stable with Python 3.6.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Right now scrapy doesn't support Python 3.7 temporarily because <code>async</code> keyword is reserved in python 3.7 and scrapy's dependancy <code>twisted</code> has not yet resolved this issue.</p>
<p>See scrapy issue regarding this: <a href="https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3143" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/3143</a></p>
<p>Current fix for this is to install Twisted branch that has this fix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you can install the branch with <code>pip install git+https://github.com/lopuhin/twisted.git@9384-remove-async-param</code></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>another solution from the <code>scrapy</code> side would be to disable the extension causing the error which is the <code>scrapy.extensions.telnet.TelnetConsole</code> extension.</p>
<p>Just update the following lines in <code>settings.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>EXTENSIONS = {
    'scrapy.extensions.telnet.TelnetConsole': None,
}
</code></pre>
<p>It is very likely that you are not going to use telnet for your spider, so this shouldn't complicate anything on your project.</p>
