<p>Hi there, thanks for taking your time to help me. I am an amateur, self taught python coder. I am trying to figure out how to write a .txt file with conditional loops and various user inputs. I realize that this is noobie, but how does one allow for all this information to be stored in a .txt file? </p>
<p>This is for my valet parking job, just a fun side project to help me get more experience! Thank you. Any suggestions are welcome too, to improve my code - I realize its probably screams noob! </p>

<p><code>file.write</code> instead of <code>print</code> would write if to a file. Also <code>input</code> writes to the monitor and not the file. Check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html</a></p>
<p>You need not repeat the code for each of the workers, instead you can do something like this which <em>loops</em> over the <em>variable</em> sized <code>workers</code>:</p>
<pre><code>tips = 100
workers = [("w1", 8), ("w2", 8)]
hours = 0
with open("scratch.log", "w") as f:
    for worker, hour in workers:
        hours = hours + hour
    print(hours)
    f.write("%s\n" % str(hours))
    for worker, hour in workers:
        tip = (float(tips) / float(hours)) * hour
        print(worker, tip)
        f.write("%s %s\n" % (worker, str(tip)))
</code></pre>
<p>Overall code is:</p>
<pre><code>newline = '\n'

name = str(input('Name? '))
tips = int(input('Total Tips? '))
workers = int(input('Total Workers Today? '))
cars = int(input('Cars Parked Today? '))

worker_hours = []
total_hours = 0

for idx, worker in enumerate(range(workers)):
    count = idx + 1
    hours = int(input('How many hours did worker %s work? ' % count))
    worker_hours.append(('w' + str(count), hours))

with open("tips.log", "w") as f:
    for worker, hours in worker_hours:
        total_hours = total_hours + hours
    print(total_hours)
    f.write("%s" % str(total_hours))
    f.write(newline)
    for worker, hours in worker_hours:
        tip = (float(tips) / float(total_hours)) * hours
        print(worker, tip)
        f.write("%s %s" % (worker, str(tip)))
        f.write(newline)  
    cartips = tips/cars
    print('Tips per car today was $%s.' % cartips)
    f.write('Tips per car today was $%s.' % cartips)
    f.write(newline)

<span class="comment-copy">@KyleOliver, did this help in solving your problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So basically there is not an efficient way of writing the data to a file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The inputs dont need to be on the file, just the printed information. IS there a way to print and write to the file, sir? Thank you, as I said im a noob :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KyleOliver, I have updated that! That is so trivial. You can write a simple function that does both and call that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks mate, now I can study it, it is much more concise than mine!</span>
