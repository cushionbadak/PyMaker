<p>I have been trying to solve this question a bit now and I am currently stumped. 
Can someone show me a step by step solution or a way to go about this question?</p>
<p>Write a function that takes a dict as its input and returns the number of vowels contained within the dict's string keys.  For this exercise, you can consider a vowel to be the letters "a", "e", "i", "o", or "u".
I suppose an example would be count_dict_vowels({"Here": "Now", "When": "Python"}) == 3</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You didn't specify how you wanted the output to look like so I created a new dictionary with the same keys but the number of vowels as the value.</p>
<p>The "trick" here is using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>map()</code></a> to take advantage of the <code>str</code> method <code>count()</code> and summing all the values.</p>
<pre><code>vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

sample_dict = {
    'abc': 'xyz',
    'ee': 'xyz',
    'aei': 'xyz',
    'uuu': 'xyz'
}

output_dict = {
    key: sum(map(key.count, vowels)) for key in sample_dict
}
</code></pre>
<p>Gives the output:</p>
<pre><code>{'abc': 1, 'ee': 2, 'aei': 3, 'uuu': 3}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Not doing homework, just saw a problem that I have no idea how to approach. @mad_</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>a={"Here": "Now", "When": "Python"} vowel=['a','i','o','u','e'] temp_list=''.join(a.keys()) sum([1 for x in temp_list if x in vowel])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">nice approach  :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Iam ever wondering if this kind of solution on a lvl not near the OP level is snark in disguise ... nice solution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Alg_D "Write a function that takes a dict as its input and returns the number of vowels contained within the dict's string keys." I think this is already correct.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Arda Arslan, right :), I just look to the code since it looks interisting and pythonic. Then just tought... :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It said to count the keys itself that are strings  but I could be wrong since the wording of the question is weird in my opinion @Alg_D</span>
