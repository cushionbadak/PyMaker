<p>I am trying to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.system</code></a> for opening text file as below.</p>
<pre><code>def fileshow():
  cf = tb2.get().replace('\n', '')
  hn = tb6.get().replace('\n', '')
  fc = tb3.get().replace('\n', '')
  ff = cf + "/" + hn + "/" + fc
  os.system("gedit ff")
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that gedit opens a file with name <code>ff</code> instead of taking the path value that is stored in <code>ff</code>. Help is needed thanks in advance.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have <code>ff</code> inside the double-quotes, so it's interpreted as the literal characters <code>ff</code>, not as a reference to the variable named <code>ff</code>.</p>
<p>You could build the command like this:</p>
<pre><code>os.system("gedit " + ff)
</code></pre>
<p>But this is dangerous; it can have unexpected results if the value of <code>ff</code> contains spaces, newlines, semicolons, etc. It is recommended to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess</code></a> module instead, which lets you pass the arguments in a list instead of having to construct a string representation of the command you're running.</p>
<pre><code>subprocess.run(["gedit", ff])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you are forgetting the $ sign to escape the env var.</p>
<p>try:</p>
<pre><code>os.system("gedit $ff")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">first solution is the best one thanks Martin. Got it right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the subprocess command when written gives error as unresolved reference. Can't make out what it means and the remedy.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Import it with this line at the top: import subprocess</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks it is a good learning experience</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This commands only opens an Untitled Document1. Value of ff is still at large.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are right, I had the wrong language. I was thinking bash and didn't see the python tag.</span>
