<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to check if a given word is between two other words, by alphabetical (or "dictionary") order.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>word1 = 'feelgoodlab'
word2 = 'elainedilley'
check = 'feelingfat'
</code></pre>
<p>I want to see if <code>check</code> is between <code>word1</code> and <code>word2</code> (it is).</p>
<p>I tried this:</p>
<pre><code>word1 = 'feelgoodlab'
word2 = 'elainedilley'
check = 'feelingfat'

print(check &gt;= word1 and check &lt;= word2)
</code></pre>
<p>but that's giving me <code>False</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Well you here basically check if:</p>
<pre><code>word1 &lt;= check &lt;= word2
</code></pre>
<p>But here, it is the opposite: <code>word2</code> is less, and <code>word1</code> is greater, we can however compbine the two possibilities with:</p>
<pre><code>word1 &lt;= check &lt;= word2 or word2 &lt;= check &lt;= word1
</code></pre>
<p>So here regardless of what the order is between <code>word1</code> and <code>word2</code>, it checks if <code>check</code> is "<em>sandwiched</em>" in between.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Well it is the opposite here: <code>check &gt;= word2 and check &lt;= word1</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your statement that check is between word1 and word2 is incorrect, at-least from how string comparison works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To add, this method is called <i>chained comparisons</i> and is detailed in the docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</span>
