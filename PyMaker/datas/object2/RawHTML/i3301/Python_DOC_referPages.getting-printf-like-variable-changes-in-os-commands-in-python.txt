<p>I'm not entirely sure how to express what I need, but in essence, I need for something like </p>
<pre><code>dirname = raw_inpur("what is your dirname")

os.mkdir(os.getcwd(), %s) %dirname
os.chdir(os.getcwd()/ %s), %dirname
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what the proper syntax for something like this is. </p>
<p>Edit: Just overthinking ofc thanks</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are looking for <code>os.path.join</code> to build a path (in an OS-appropriate way) from two strings:</p>
<pre><code>os.mkdir(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), dirname))
os.chdir(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), dirname))
</code></pre>
<p>Since paths are just strings, you can use whatever string formatting operations you want as well:</p>
<pre><code>os.mkdir(os.getcwd() + "/" + dirname)
os.mkdir("%s/%s" % (os.getcwd(), dirname))
os.mkdir("{}/{}".format(os.getcwd(), dirname))
</code></pre>
<p>All three share the same problem, though, which is that you assume that <code>/</code> is the correct path separator.</p>
<p>(I'll mention the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pathlib</code></a> module here as well, without getting into how to use it or where its use is appropriate.)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you asking "how can I get a directory name from the user, then create a directory with that name in the current working directory, then change the current working directory to that directory?"? I don't think you need string formatting for that. Just pass the string straight into the function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kevin interesting, what exactly do you mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>os.mkdir(dirname); os.chdir(dirname)</code></span>
