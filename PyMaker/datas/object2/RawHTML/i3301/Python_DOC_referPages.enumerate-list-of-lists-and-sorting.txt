<p>I am following a tutorial online, and having trouble understanding what the code does.</p>
<p>Here, questions_int is a list of lists containing numbers in the following format:</p>
<pre><code>[[7214,1596,2353,4125,3214], [1234,2345,3252,4235], ..... , [4234,5378,4234,5235]]
</code></pre>
<p>The goal is to sort by the questions by its length to reduce amount of padding time during training the data for sequence 2 sequence model. But I don't understand how the code works and how it helps sorting by length.</p>
<pre><code>max_line_length = 20

sorted_questions = []
sorted_answers = []

for length in range(1, max_line_length+1):
    for i in enumerate(questions_int):
        if len(i[1]) == length:
            sorted_questions.append(questions_int[i[0]])
            sorted_answers.append(answers_int[i[0]])
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so let's take this line by line.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>for length in range(1, max_line_length+1):</code> iterates from 1 to max_line_length.  This means <code>length</code> will first be equal to <code>1</code>, then when the loop finishes <code>length</code> will be equal to <code>2</code>, etc. until <code>length is finally equal to</code>max_line_length` (20 in this case)</p></li>
<li><p><code>for i in enumerate(questions_int):</code> makes i equal to a tuple of (index, element), meaning that <code>len(i[1])</code> will be the length of the ith question.  As <code>length</code> increases in value from one, the shortest questions and answers will gradually be added to the lists, hence the <code>append(</code> calls within the 2nd for loop</p></li>
<li><p>The line <code>sorted_questions.append(questions_int[i[0]])</code> will append the question at the current index where <code>len(i[1])==length</code>.  Remember that i is a tuple of 2 elements, and the first is the index of the current question.  So <code>questions_int[i[0]]</code> is the question that has length <code>length</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, <code>answers_int[i[0]]</code> is the answer corresponding to that question.  So whenever we find a slightly longer question using the <code>if</code> condition, the list <code>sorted_answers</code> gets longer by 1 with the new answer, and <code>sorted_questions</code> does as well</p></li>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi, welcome to SO.  Excuse me, but what precisely is the question?  What do you not understand?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you just don't understand what a particular function does, like <code>enumerate</code> (I'm just guessing at what you're question is here, so apologies if I'm wrong), <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">look it up in the docs</a>. If you <i>still</i> don't understand it after reading the docs, or if you understand it in general but not how it applies in some line of code, then you can ask a specific question that can be easily answered.</span>
