<p>I want my program to read 2 columns (the first and the second one) and add them to an array. They are dependent on eachother - so they need to be written alongside eachother, as in the first row (both columns) next to eachother, and then the second row and so on.</p>
<p>I have managed to write the first column (containing the names) to the array, however have not managed to write the second column to the array.</p>
<pre><code>rownum=1
array=[]
for row in reader:
    if row[1] != '' and row[1] != 'Score':
        array.append(row[1])
        rownum=rownum+1
        if rownum==11:
            break
</code></pre>
<p>I attempted to append more than one row however it returns the error message 'only accepts one argument'.
Any ideas how I can do this so i can reference the score for each name from the csv file</p>

<p>Try using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionary</a>.</p>
<pre><code>d = {} #curly braces denote an empty dictionary
for row in reader:
    d[row[0]] = row[1]
</code></pre>
<p><code>d</code>, in this case, would be a dictionary with the first column of your csv file as the keys and the second column as the corresponding values.</p>
<p>You can access it very similar to how you access a list. Say you had <code>Brian,80</code> as one of the entries in your csv file, <code>d["Brian"]</code> would return <code>80</code>.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>OP has requested (in the comments) for a more complete version of the code. Assuming OP's code already works, I'll modify that code so it works with a dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>rownum=1
d={} #denotes an empty dictionary
for row in reader:
    if row[1] != '' and row[1] != 'Score':
        d[row[0]]=row[1] #first column is the key/index, second column is the value
        rownum=rownum+1
        if rownum==11:
            break
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The assumption in this answer is that the keys are unique and there are no duplicate rows.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you please add more detail and show what the finished code looks like? I have played around with this and cannot get the code to work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jpp Yes, thank you for mentioning that. CallumTwig I have edited the answer per your request. Please inform me if it works.</span>
