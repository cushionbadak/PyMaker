<p>I'm new to Python, so I was hoping somebody could break down the following statement and explain the purpose of each part.</p>
<pre><code>[digit for digit in string.split() if digit.isdigit()][0]
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously <code>for digit in string.split()</code> creates a list of substrings by separating the string into elements at each space.</p>
<p>What confuses me is the <code>digit</code> at the very beginning and the <code>if</code> statement at the very end.</p>
<p><strong>Is the very first <code>digit</code> what will be returned <code>if digit.isdigit()</code>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why must this statement be wrapped in a list?</strong></p>
<p>I've never seen a for loop and an if statement combined into one statement like this before, but it reminds me of a particular JS syntax: <code>for (condition) // whatever</code> or <code>if (condition) // whatever</code>. However, in JS you can't combine them into a single statement (i.e. <code>for (condition) if (condition) // whatever</code>).</p>

<p>This is called a list comprehension. You will find plenty of pages explaining how it works. Just ask you favorite search engine.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a> expression, not a statement. It turns what otherwise would be written with <code>for</code> loops and <code>if</code> statements into a single expression that evaluates as a list. It isn't necessary to use list comprehension, but it helps to make code more concise and in some cases, easier to read.  Please read the official documentation for more details.</span>
