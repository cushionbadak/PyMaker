<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Im trying the code on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> documentation page of Python3 about HTTP Server.</p>
<p>The code posted on the site is:</p>
<pre><code>def run(server_class=HTTPServer, handler_class=BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    server_address = ('', 8000)
    httpd = server_class(server_address, handler_class)
    httpd.serve_forever()
</code></pre>
<p>this code is working. I would to try the <strong>ThreadingHTTPServer</strong> so, as the documentation says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This class (<strong><em>ThreadingHTTPServer</em></strong>) is identical to HTTPServer but uses threads to handle requests by using the ThreadingMixIn. This is useful to handle web browsers pre-opening sockets, on which HTTPServer would wait indefinitely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I changed the code above to:</p>
<pre><code>def run(server_class=http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer, handler_class=http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler$
    PORT = 8000
    server_address = ('', PORT)
    httpd = server_class(server_address, handler_class)
    print("server running on port: ", PORT)
    httpd.serve_forever()
</code></pre>
<p>but I get following error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "simple_http_server.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    def run(server_class=http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer, handler_class=http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
AttributeError: module 'http.server' has no attribute 'ThreadingHTTPServer'
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to add that it is only recently that I use Python, so I may have missed something.</p>
<p>What do you think is the cause of the error? Where am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>I think I know why you got this issue. If you read carefully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>class http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer(server_address,
  RequestHandlerClass)</p>
<p><em>This class is identical to HTTPServer but uses threads to handle requests by using the ThreadingMixIn. This is useful to handle web
  browsers pre-opening sockets, on which HTTPServer would wait
  indefinitely.</em></p>
<p><strong>New in version 3.7.</strong> &lt;-this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible you don't have the newest version.</p>
