<p>I am trying to parse arguments in python code sent from slack... what does this mean is when someone types a command in slack I want to differentiate based on string and other args.</p>
<p>for eg in slack if I use !command inc-number some string and then sometimes
!command inc-number word how could I differentiate both</p>
<p>===============================================================================</p>
<pre><code>def update(self,*args):

    inc = args[0]
    id = self.getincsysid(inc) # this func gets the sysid of inc to be update in servicenow.

    request = 'api/now/table/incident/'
    service_now_url = service now url

    url = service_now_url + request + id
    headers = {"Accept": "application/json"}

    # I am stuck here how to differentiate if args1 is a string.
    if args[1] == 'string': #do below 
        requests.put(url, auth=(user, pwd), headers=headers, json= 
    {'comments': args})
        return 'inc updated'
    elif args[1]=='word':
        impact = 'imapct1'
        criticality= 'urgency1'
        requests.put(url, auth=(user, pwd), headers=headers, json={'impact': 
    impact, 'criticality': urgency})

    else:
        return 'none matched'

<p>It is pretty difficult to differentiate a <strong>word</strong> from a <strong>string</strong>, mainly because  a <code>word</code> <strong>IS</strong> a <code>string</code>.<br/>
If we take as an example for a <code>word</code> the string <code>"p1"</code> and an example for a <code>phrase</code> the string <code>"work done"</code>, we may define a <code>word</code> as a set of one or more characters not containing a space, and a <code>phrase</code> as a set of words separed by a space.</p>
<p>Starting by this assumption, our <code>args[1]</code> is a <code>phrase</code> if contains at least one space (we <em>should</em> also verify that it contains at least 2 characters...), else it's a <code>word</code> if it contains at least 1 character, else is something wrong:</p>
<pre><code>if " " in args[1]: #do below 
    requests.put(url, auth=(user, pwd), headers=headers, json= 
{'comments': args})
    return 'inc updated'
elif len(args[1])&gt;0:
    impact = 'imapct1'
    criticality= 'urgency1'
    requests.put(url, auth=(user, pwd), headers=headers, json={'impact': 
impact, 'criticality': urgency})

else:
    return 'none matched'

<p>Slack will always return the complete user input as one big string. So you need to implement a parse to transform that string into arguments in accordance with your syntax design.</p>
<p>They are many ways to approach this. I usually use a syntax where a space is used as delimiter to identify each argument plus <code>"</code> can be used to encapsulate a longer sentence with multiple words as one argument.</p>
<p>I guess your best approach would be to use existing parsers. e.g. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shlex</a> to parse the input from Slack. </p>
<p>See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5035702/python-string-argument-parsing">this answer</a> for examples on how shlex works.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you're asking how you can differentiate <b>a string</b> from <b>a word</b>, you can't (unless you have some other info): can we refine the question as differentiate <b>a string with spaces</b> and <b>a string without spaces</b>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so what i am sending from slack is !command incnumber  work done (this is going to notes field)and in another case, I am doing !command incnumber p1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">splitting arg is not a issue , i am facing issue with how to tell my function that sometime fargs will be a string sometimes it can be just a letter or say a word.</span>
