<p>If you can also please provide a small example on the usage and how data is processed. </p>
<p>I am trying to calculate the median of any grouped data like age cohort, for instance, how to choose the median value of such datasets.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Finding the median of a data set is quite easy. All you need to do is type <code>median(data set)</code>. In your example you would write:</p>
<pre><code>age_cohort = #list of numbers
med_age = medium(age_cohort)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much for your answer, actually I was looking for python example , I didn't try to build one yet , I will soon and share it with you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Paul, indeed finding the median of a dataset is easy , but I want to find the median of an age_cohort as you said , if I am getting your idea right, your idea is to list the age_cohorts as an array and find it is median ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Raed No, I am not listing it as an array, I am just finding the median. You would define age_cohort in your program as a dataset containing each persons age and median(age_cohort) would just find the median.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now I got your point, but I want my output to be the median of age_cohort category, for example if 15-20 = 20 (persons) , 21-35 = 40 persons and so on , I want the median to be 21-35 if it has the median numbers of the dataset</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm lost. Can you give me an example so I can understand better?</span>
