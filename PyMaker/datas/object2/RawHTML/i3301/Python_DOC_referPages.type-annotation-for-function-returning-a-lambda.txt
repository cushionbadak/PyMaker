<p>I’m very fond of the idea of using type annotations in Python. I know how to do such like in this simple example:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(bar : int, lol : int) -&gt; int:
     return bar*lol
</code></pre>
<p>But I have no clue of how to do so when my function is going to return a lambda:</p>
<pre><code>def line(slope : float, b : float) -&gt; lambda:
     return lambda x: slope*x + b
</code></pre>
<p>This example generates an error, and I wonder what’s the keyword I’m supposed to use for this return type. </p>
<p>Perhaps this doesn’t seem so useful but I want to keep my code consistently annotated and being unable to do so with these type of functions is really bothering me.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Callable</a> to type hint the return:</p>
<pre><code>from typing import Callable

def line(slope : float, b : float) -&gt; Callable[[float], float]:
     return lambda x: slope*x + b
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Well, the interpreter is never really checking these but my attempt was invalid syntax. What you have proposed works just fine and makes sense for me. Please post it as an answer so I can accept it. Thank you.</span>
