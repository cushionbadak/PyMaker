<p>I have my <code>.txt</code>  file saved as <code>writing.txt</code> on my computer and on my project. I want to define a function so that when the user selects <code>option A</code>, it prints the text file.</p>
<p>I have tried this with no success</p>
<pre><code>def showMembers:
    print (writing.txt)
    writing.txt(close)
</code></pre>
<p>However, I'm really stuck on how to get it to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>def</code> keyword is lower case.</p>
<p>You also need  to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">open()</a> the file in the first place to read it. It's recommended to do this through the context manager <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with" rel="nofollow noreferrer">with</a> so python automatically closes the file once you're done reading it.</p>
<p>Try:</p>
<pre><code>def show_members():
    with open('writing.text') as file:
        # Iterate through all lines of the file
        for line in file:
            print(line)

# Call your function
show_members()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I have added the code that you kindly provided and made it my own! However, how do I actually make it so that when the user selects B, this function runs. I have this so far with the code you kindly provided above. elif answer == "b":  print("Okay, lets start")</span>
