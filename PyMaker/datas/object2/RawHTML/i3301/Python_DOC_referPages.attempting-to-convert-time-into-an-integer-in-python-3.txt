<p>I'm extremely new to Python and programming in general, and I've been working at this particular issue for about four hours now.
I am trying to convert a time (ex. 12:30) to something usable in an "if" statement.
Here's what I've tried so far:</p>
<pre><code>time = input("Enter the time the call starts in 24-hour notation:\n").split(":")
if time &gt;= 8:30 and time &lt;= 18:00:
    print("YES")
</code></pre>
<p>When attempting to perform that, I get an invalid syntax error.
When I attempt to convert the time to an integer <code>[callTime = int(time)]</code>, I get an error stating that the </p>
<blockquote>
<p>int() argument must be a string</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just a piece of the entire problem I am working on, but I think I can figure out the rest if I can just get a jumping off point with this issue.
Although I don't believe I'm allowed to use datetime on this particular problem; anything would help.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Corrected int(time)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>8:30</code> is not a valid datatype. Convert it as integer to make it work (8:30 = 8 hours and 30 min = 8*60+30 min)</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; time = input("Enter the time the call starts in 24-hour notation:\n").split(":")
Enter the time the call starts in 24-hour notation:
12:30
&gt;&gt;&gt; time
['12', '30'] # list of str
&gt;&gt;&gt; time = [int(i) for i in time] # will raise an exception if str cannot be converted to int
&gt;&gt;&gt; time
[12, 30] # list of int
&gt;&gt;&gt; 60*time[0] + time[1] # time in minutes
750
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>To get it in seconds, like <code>12:30:58</code>, do the same thing with <code>time_in_sec = time[0] * 3600 + time[1] * 60 + time[2]</code> in the last line.</p>
<p>Due to modulo properties, it's guaranteed that only one "real" time correspond to an hour converted as integer.<br/>
For your problem, create a function <code>to_integer(time_as_list)</code> returning an int, and then compare user entry to <code>to_integer('18:00'.split(':'))</code> and <code>to_integer('8:30'.split(':'))</code></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Working with time manually is not trivial. I suggest that you use the <code>datetime</code> module that supports time conversion, comparison, etc.</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime as dt
t = input("...")
t_object = dt.strptime(t, "%H:%M")
if t_object &gt;= dt.strptime("8:30", "%H:%M") and \
   t_object &lt;= dt.strptime("18:00", "%H:%M"):
    do_your_stuff()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are using a colon where Python expects a number or variable name. In this statement: <code>if time &gt;= 8:30 and time &lt;= 18:00:</code>, you need to put the time values in quotes (<code>"8:30"</code>) since they are non-numerical. Then, however, you will run into the issue of comparing two non-numerical values with your <code>&gt;=</code> and <code>&lt;=</code> statements. Comparisons only work with actual values, and the colon makes the value into a string instead of an int or float. It would be a better idea to convert the time into an integer by <a href="http://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/str/strip.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">stripping</a> out the colon for comparisons and other manipulation, then you can add the colon back in as necessary. </p>

<p>My take on the problem (without <code>datetime</code>):</p>
<pre><code>answer = input("Enter the time the call starts in 24-hour notation:\n")
t = tuple(int(i) for i in answer.split(':'))

if (8, 30) &lt;= t &lt;= (18, 0):
    print("YES")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Using python syntax, callTime = (int)time should be callTime = int(time). However, you cannot just convert a string representing a time to an int by using the int function. Look into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/time.html</a> for parsing times into integer time stamps.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">politinsa is not OP</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@killian95 It doesnt matter. The remark about <code>datetime</code> was inserted after I posted the answer.</span>
