<p>Apparently running <code>os.path.join</code> on Ubuntu on Windows 10 gives the path in the Windows OS (with the backslash separator). Is there a way to override that (other than, of course, booting from an <em>actual</em> Ubuntu machine?)</p>
<p>I'm trying to use sqlalchemy on an sqlite file, and <code>create_engine('sqlite:///{0}'.format(db_filepath))</code> is giving me headaches.</p>

<p>Based on metatoaster's suggestion, I reinstalled a virtualenv (via <code>virtualenvwrapper</code>) on Python 3 on WSL using </p>
<pre><code>mkvirtualenv envname --python=`which python3`
</code></pre>
<p>So when I run python3, everything now works. Apparently, I was calling the Windows version of Python.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">If you executed the Windows version of Python from within WSL that can happen.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I haven't installed python 3 on WSL...so I'm guessing it's built-in? Or is it calling the Windows version of python 3 that I've installed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you can use the pathlib module, but I can't try it. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try <code>import os</code> and/or <code>import sys</code> and check the values of <code>os.platform</code> and/or <code>sys.executable</code>, and also see that <code>os.path</code> is actually <code>posixpath</code> and not <code>ntpath</code>.</span>
