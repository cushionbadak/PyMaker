<p>I want to write a code which gives me all the possible combinations of n elements in a k length k&gt;n.The issue with this code is that i run out of memory quite fast.I was wondering if someone knew how to fix this with generators.I don't want to get all the possible combinations of a list elements. I want to get all the combinations of the elements in a certain length.
Thanks.</p>
<pre><code>def allstrings(alphabet, length):
    """Find the list of all strings of 'alphabet' of length 'length'"""

    if length == 0: return []

    c = [[a] for a in alphabet[:]]
    if length == 1: return c

    c = [[x,y] for x in alphabet for y in alphabet]
    if length == 2: return c

    for l in range(2, length):
        c = [[x]+y for x in alphabet for y in c]

    return c

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for p in allstrings(['a','b','c'],4):
        print (p)

<span class="comment-copy">Have you looked in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools</code></a>? I'm assuming you're doing this as a learning exercise, not because you actually need all the combinations of those three letters—but notice that <code>combinations</code>, <code>product</code>, etc. all come with "roughly equivalent" code that you can read to see how to do it yourself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It was an example, i need the combinations of 64 elements in a length of 10000 approximately but i get Memoryerror. Thanks anyway!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"i need the combinations of 64 elements in a length of 10000" - no you don't, you need to figure out a better way to solve whatever problem you wanted to use that output for. You're never going to finish going through all that output even if you dodge the memory problems.</span>
