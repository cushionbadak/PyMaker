<p>I'm getting with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>RPI</strong> and there is this script in the examples for the Sense HAT emulator were I don't know what are a pair of lines of code for me they look like an array but I think they might be other kind of data, so this is the code:</p>
<pre><code>from sense_emu import SenseHat

sense = SenseHat()

green = (0, 255, 0)
white = (255, 255, 255)

while True:
    humidity = sense.humidity
    humidity_value = 64 * humidity / 100
    pixels = [green if i &lt; humidity_value else white for i in range(64)]
    sense.set_pixels(pixels)
</code></pre>
<p>What kind of data are this two ?</p>
<pre><code>green = (0, 255, 0)
white = (255, 255, 255)
</code></pre>
