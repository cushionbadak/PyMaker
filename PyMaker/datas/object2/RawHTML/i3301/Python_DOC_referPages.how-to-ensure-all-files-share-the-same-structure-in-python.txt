<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a file where the first line is the sport category and the following lines are semicolon separated values where each of them follow the same structure: str-str-int-int.</p>
<p>How would you go about reading and processing these files and in case of a different structure, raise an error? I'd like to check length of the string list and also the type</p>
<p>Sample input:</p>
<pre><code>BASKETBALL
player 1; Peter; 23; 15;
player 2; Steve; 14; 10;
</code></pre>
<p>Sample error:</p>
<pre><code>FOOTBALL
player 4; Carl; ten; 22; 15;
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>For your specific data pattern, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Regular Expression</a> to check the structure of your data:</p>
<pre><code>import re

# Here is the specific pattern you want to match
regex = re.compile(r'^player \d+; [A-Z][a-z]+; \d+; \d+;$')
filename = 'sport.txt'
# Test for each file
with open(filename) as f:
    header = f.readline().strip()
    for line in f:
        if not regex.match(line):
            # You can also catch this Error and do some other things
            raise ValueError('Line Not Match: ' + line)

print('Sports {} in {} is GOOD!'.format(header, filename))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">player 4; Carl; ten; 22; 15; How you want to do with this line, by pass or just select the desired result? player 4;Carl;22;15?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What did you try and why are you unhappy with it? Please post your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I used split(";") with strip() and checked the length of the result, if it was not the same, I raised an error. I was stucked with the numbers in words without using regex</span>
