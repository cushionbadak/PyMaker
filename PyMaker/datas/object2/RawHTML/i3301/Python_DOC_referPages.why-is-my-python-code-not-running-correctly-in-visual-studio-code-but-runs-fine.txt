<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am currently learning Python and have come across a very strange problem (to me at least). When I type this code:</p>
<pre><code>def search4vowels(word):
    """Display any vowels found in a supplied word."""
    vowels = set('aeiou')
    found = vowels.intersection(set(word))
    return bool(found)
</code></pre>
<p>in an IDLE edit window and run it using IDLE, it all works fine and I need to type my function in at the prompt in order for it to start.</p>
<p>However, when I write the same code in VS Code and run it using the <strong>Run 
 Python file in Terminal</strong> option all I get is:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NdLLa.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="IDE screenshot" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NdLLa.png"/></a></p>
<p>I have also tried the <strong>Code Runner</strong> extension and that gives me a blank output page and no way to type in the function.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong>: <code>search4vowels('galaxy')</code></p>
<p>And the output that I expect should be: <code>True</code> (Because a vowel would be present in the word, therefore True)</p>
<p>However, nothing happens. </p>
<p>I am a beginner and I could not come up with an explanation or a solution to this problem. I apologize if a question like this has been asked but I have not come across a similar problem.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are defining function <code>search4vowels()</code> but VisualStudio doesn't know how to run it.</p>
<p>Try adding this in your code:</p>
<pre><code>def search4vowels(word):
    """Display any vowels found in a supplied word."""
    vowels = set('aeiou')
    found = vowels.intersection(set(word))
    return bool(found)

# This tells your code to run the function search4vowels():
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(search4vowels('your word'))
</code></pre>
<p>Here is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">manual page</a> about the word <code>"__main__"</code>.</p>
