<p>In most Python tutorials, <code>slice</code> is described as a notation, such as myarray[1:] for the sub-array of myarray starting from the 2nd element.</p>
<p>Now I need to invoke <code>scipy.optimize.brute</code>  which needs a slice as an object in its arguments. Its  example code uses <code>slice(-4,4,0.25)</code>, which looks like <code>numpy.arange(-4,4,0.25)</code> to me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I cannot find documentation about slice as an object. What does <code>slice(-4,4,0.25)</code> represent exactly?</p>

<p>That is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>slice</code></a> object which can be passed as an argument to an index, giving it the given slice parameters.</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np 

a = np.arange(10) 
s = slice(2,7,2) 

print(a[s])
&gt;&gt;&gt;[2  4  6]
</code></pre>
