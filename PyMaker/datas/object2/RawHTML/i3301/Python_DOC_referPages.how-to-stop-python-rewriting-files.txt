<p>Is there a way to stop Python rewriting files?</p>
<p>For example, when I run code once, it writes number "1" in text file. If I run same code tommorow, it won't erase that 1 from yesterday, it will add one more "1", so it should look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1</p>
<p>1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>file = open("filename","w")
file.write(str(1) + "\n)
file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>If someone can tell me where is my mistake, please help me.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance !</p>

<p>If you read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs for <code>open</code></a>, that second parameter that you're passing a <code>"w"</code> to is the <code>mode</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>mode</em> is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to <code>'r'</code> which means open for reading in text mode. Other common values are <code>'w'</code> for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), <code>'x'</code> for exclusive creation and <code>'a'</code> for appending…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then there's a handy chart of all of the mode characters, which reiterates the same information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'w'</code>: open for writing, truncating the file first</li>
<li>...</li>
<li><code>'a'</code>: open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists</li>
</ul>
<p>So, just use <code>"a"</code> instead of <code>"w"</code>, and Python will add your new line to the end of the file, instead of truncating the file to nothing and then adding your new line to that now-empty file.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It's probably worth knowing that this is very closely based on the behavior of the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>fopen</code></a> function from C and POSIX—which many other languages have also copied. So, in almost any language you run into, if there's a <code>w</code> mode for writing that overwrites the file, there's probably also an <code>a</code> mode for appending.</p>

Also, it is unclear what you want: do you want to keep adding to the existing file or start fresh each day?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As I said, keep adding into the same file. :/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>open</code></a> in the docs. That table of <i>mode</i> values is probably what you're looking for. (And this is useful to learn, because it's closely related to what C does, and therefore what a whole lot of other languages do.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">abarnert I looked in docs and i saw this: 'a'	open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists So, I think this is something I wanted! Thank you!</span>
