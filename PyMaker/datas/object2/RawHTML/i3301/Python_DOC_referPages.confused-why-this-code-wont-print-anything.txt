<p>I was making a simple pokemon game for fun on python and this code won't print anything</p>
<pre><code>a = int(input("1. Leave for an adventure 2. Ask the professor more questions Type 1 or 2 to answer"))

if a == "1":
 print ("You encounter a pidgey it should be an easy battle but be ready")
if a == "2":
 print ("What are you doing come on go adventure!")
</code></pre>

<p>Since this is too long to put as a comment, I just want to say that the other answers are fine and underline the problem, but I just don't see why no one suggested to just remove your <code>int</code> casting. </p>
<pre><code>a = input("1. Leave for an adventure 2. Ask the professor more questions Type 1 or 2 to answer")

if a == "1":
    print ("You encounter a pidgey it should be an easy battle but be ready")
if a == "2":
    print ("What are you doing come on go adventure!")
else:
    print ("Value is not 1 or 2")
</code></pre>
<p>Since you are clearly using the input as a switch, just let it as a string instead of manipulating as a int and having to deal with potential <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ValueError</code></a>.</p>

<p>Python is strong-typed. You can't compare an <code>int</code> value to an <code>str</code> value and expect them to be equal. Do this instead:</p>
<pre><code>a = int(input("1. Leave for an adventure 2. Ask the professor more questions Type 1 or 2 to answer"))

if a == 1:
 print ("You encounter a pidgey it should be an easy battle but be ready")
if a == 2:
 print ("What are you doing come on go adventure!")
</code></pre>

<p>Do not compare int to a string. And do not miss the perfect time to use <code>elif</code>:</p>
<pre><code>a = int(input("1. Leave for an adventure 2. Ask the professor more questions Type 1 or 2 to answer"))

if a == 1:
  print("You encounter a pidgey it should be an easy battle but be ready")
elif a == 2:
  print("What are you doing come on go adventure!")
</code></pre>

<p>This is wrong, why do you have it as an integer. An integer is a <strong>number</strong> not a <strong>string</strong>. All you need is go <code>a = input('...')</code> Then you'll be done! </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to Stack Overflow. See how to create a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You did the same as me!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Guydangerous99 I know you're new, but please stop telling people they copied answers. I did not see your answer while I was writing mine. By the way, the quality of an answer what makes it good or not. In your case, it gives 0 insight on how to workaround his error. In my opinion, my answer is more specific to his problem. If not, feel free downvoting. But please stop commenting that to everyone. Enjoy Stack man, you'll get reputation soon enough.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Guydangerous99 Don't feel like an idiot my man. Just learn from your mistakes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right :) By the way I just asked a question on pygame, maybe u can help?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Isn't this more to do with coercion than typing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You did exactly the same as the code above!?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Guydangerous99 I actually posted my answer a few seconds earlier than the answer above, and stackoverflow always puts the later answers on top of earlier answers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Telling him to <i>go <code>a = input('...')</code></i> is kinda vague, don't you think ? Try to be more specific to his problem it will help understanding what you want to say.</span>
