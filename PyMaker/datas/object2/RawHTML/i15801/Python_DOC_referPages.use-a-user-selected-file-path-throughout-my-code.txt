<p>I have my code: </p>

</code></pre>
<p>My <code>mnuRead</code> method allows the user to open a file of their choice. I want to use the string of this filepath in the<code>btnHDI</code> method below. </p>
<p>Setting my <code>fn</code> variable to global is giving me a syntax error. How do I use this filepath in other methods? </p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-global_stmt" rel="nofollow"><code>global</code></a> is only used for <em>declaring</em> one or more names as being global.  </p>
<p>You need to move the assignment of <code>fn = dialog.GetPath()</code> to the line below:</p>
<pre><code>global fn 
fn = dialog.GetPath()
</code></pre>
<p>Also, it is a common practice to put global declarations at the start of a function:</p>
<pre><code>def mnuRead(self, event):
    global fn
</code></pre>
<p>That way, they are easily visible.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">In my edited code above, I am still receiving an error saying that 'fn' is an undefined name in my 'btnHDI' method. Why is that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PhilipMcQuitty - Are you somehow calling <code>btnHDI</code> before <code>mnuRead</code>?  When you call <code>mnuRead</code>, <code>fn</code> is made global and should be accessible to all other functions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PhilipMcQuitty - Another possibility is that <code>if dialog.ShowModal() == wx.ID_OK:</code> evaluates to <code>False</code> so that <code>fn</code> is never set.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't believe so, mnuRead is a menu option for the user to select the file, then btnHDI is a button that needs to use this file path selected by the user.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah I am baffled, nothing seems to be working. I really just need the string of the path that the user selects. Is there any type of .get method i'm not aware of?</span>
