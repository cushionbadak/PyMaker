<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a folder of <code>.tif</code> files, and I would like to write their filenames to a <code>.txt</code> or <code>.csv</code> file without the file extension, using python. This should be pretty simple but for some reason I always end up with an empty text file. Can anyone see something in my code that I am doing wrong? It prints the names correctly so I know there is no problem with the <code>.rstrip</code> command. </p>
<pre><code># import os so you get the os access methods
import os

# set a directory the files are in
workingDir = r'F:\filepath\files'

# get a list of all the files in the directory
names = os.listdir(workingDir)

#print file names
for name in names:
    listname=name.rstrip('.tif')
    print listname


#write filenames to text file
target = open("F:\filepath\list.txt", "w")

for name in names:
    listname=name.rstrip('.tif')
    target.writelines(listname)
    target.writelines("\n")

target.close
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You forgot to actually call the <code>close</code> method at the end of your program.  Add <code>()</code> after it to do this:</p>
<pre><code>target.close()
</code></pre>
<p>On some systems (presumably yours), you must close the file to commit the changes.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Or, even better, you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement" rel="noreferrer">with-statement</a> to open the file, which will automatically close it for you:</p>
<pre><code>with open("F:\filepath\list.txt", "w") as target:
    for name in names:
        listname=name.rstrip('.tif')
        target.writelines(listname)
        target.writelines("\n")
</code></pre>
