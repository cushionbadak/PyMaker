<p>I'm trying to replace one value in a file with a values. Everything works fine but when I look at the file after its completed there no change at all. What can I use for this?</p>
<p>Content of the file:</p>
<pre><code>22102014,1646,1,0,1848,3559,5,0,1848,0,0,1,0,1,1664,4997,2257,9,0,1664    
</code></pre>
<p>I just want to change the tird value from <code>1</code> to <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Here is the code as I have it:</p>
<pre><code># Read in the file
with open("datafile", 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()

# Replace the target string
data.replace('1', '0')

# Write the file out again
with open("datafile", 'w') as f:
    f.write (data)    
</code></pre>
<p>CanIi do this with <code>str.replace</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You said in your question that you want to replace the <strong>third</strong> value with a <code>0</code>.  If so, then <code>str.replace</code> is not what you want to use because it will replace <strong>every</strong> <code>1</code> with a <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use the following:</p>
<pre><code># Read in the file
with open("datafile", 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()

lst = data.split(',')   # Split data on , with str.split
lst[2] = '0'            # Replace the value at index 2 (the third value)
data = ','.join(lst)    # Rebuild the string with str.join

# Write the file out again
with open("datafile", 'w') as f:
     f.write(data)
</code></pre>
<p>The string methods <code>str.split</code> and <code>str.join</code> are documented <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You need to assign the result, <code>data = data.replace(...)</code>; strings are <i>immutable</i>. But do you want to replace <b>all</b> zeros?</span>
