<p>I am using Python 2.7 on Ubuntu and I was experimenting with images before beginning an assignment for my algorithms class. I have downloaded numpy, scipy and skimage packages and I keep getting the error that 'imread' 'title' and these inbuilt functions are undefined. Any idea what could be wrong?</p>
<pre><code>   from pylab import *
   from skimage import img_as_float

   img = imread(‘someimage.png’)
   img = img_as_float(img)
   w, h = img.shape[:2]
   R = img[:,:,0]
   G = img[:,:,1]
   B = img[:,:,2]
   figure()
   gray()
   subplot(1,4,1); imshow(img); title(“RGB”)
   subplot(1,4,2); imshow(R); title(“Red”)
   subplot(1,4,3); imshow(G); title(“Green”)
   subplot(1,4,4); imshow(B); title(“Blue”)
   show()

<p>Try adding:</p>
<pre><code>from skimage.io import imread
</code></pre>
<p>to your imports.</p>

<p>Where is the imread function imported from? You can easily see all functions within an imported library. See- allhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/139180/listing-all-functions-in-a-python-module</p>
<p>If you are looking for SciPy's imread, you must do it along these lines...</p>
<pre><code>from scipy.misc import imread
...
img = imread(‘someimage.png’)
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>from scipy import misc
...
img = misc.imread('someimage.png')
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>import scipy
... 
img = scipy.misc.imread(‘someimage.png’)
</code></pre>
<p>Python does not inherently know what the title function or imread functions/methods are without having it spelled out explicitly. Importing requires you import each function/class/library etc with respect to scope. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html</a> </p>
<p>Also - first comment is correct. You will need PIL installed to use the imread function.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I think that you should install Python Imaging Library (PIL). Check :: <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pythonware.com/products/pil</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried downloading that using sudo pip install PIL. Says no distributions found.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tried sudo apt-get install python-imaging. Its already there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tried that. Still comes up with undefined names error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AveeshaSharma: If you tried this obvious thing, then why didn't you say that in your question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry. Pylab imports functions from numpy, scipy and skimage. So I didn't realize I had to explicitly mention from skimage.io import imread.  By tried I meant, I tried it after reading your post. Didn't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AveeshaSharma: Could you show the full traceback that you get to to the code in your question? Also, could you import pylab using <code>import pylab</code> and then do <code>pylab.__file__</code>? I'm wondering whether you have some other file named <code>pylab.py</code> that's being picked up first, and <code>pylab.__file__</code> should show which pylab file is being used.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried doing that! from scipy.misc import imread. Still won't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What won't work? Does imread function show up as undefined or some other function? What is the exact error you get?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. They get showed up as undefined names. imread title imshow subplot.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IanPrice Everything you've said is generally true, but <code>pylab</code> is a bit of an exception. Pylab imports a whole bunch of functions from numpy, scipy and matplotlib to try and resemble MATLAB. Not necessarily good Python practice, but using Pylab <i>should</i> mean that the functions OP is using show up in the global namespace.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Marius Interesting... have used SciPy quite a bit but never Pylab. Thanks for the insight!</span>
