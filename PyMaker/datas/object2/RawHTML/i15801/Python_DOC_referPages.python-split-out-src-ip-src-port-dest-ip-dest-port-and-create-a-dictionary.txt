<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I have opened my file and split each line into a list using the readlines() module but I am trying to get each source IP, src port, dest IP and dest port out of the readlines(). Basically what I am being asked to do is: "open the provided dump file and split out each line for the src and dest IPs as well as the src and dest ports". Furthermore, "Create a dictionary called Hosts; the keys of hosts will be the IPs parsed from the file (both src and dest). The value for each key will be a two element list where the first item will be how many times an IP is the source and the seconds is how many times an IP is the destination". </p>
<p>Here is part of parsed file...</p>

<p>FYI the file is formatted like this:</p>
<p>IP (source.Sourceport) &gt; (dest.Destport)</p>
<p>Here is what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>import os

while True:
try:
    f = open(os.path.expanduser("~/Documents/Pys/ascii_dump.txt"))
    print ("It Opened!")
    break
except:
    print ("Cannot Open!")
    break

lines = f.readlines()
</code></pre>
<p>UPDATE
Now I am looking for the best way to split a str (one line) at one char to another char. So say split it at a ":" to the next ":".</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think that you need to look at the string's split method</p>
<pre><code>f = open('data.txt', 'r')
lines = f.read()
lines = lines.split("\n")
print(lines)
for line in lines:
    line = line.split()
    if len(line) &gt; 0:
        srcIp = line[2]
        dstIp = line[4]
        print(srcIp.split('.'),dstIp.split('.'))
</code></pre>
<p>gives:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Right, so try adding some code to parse the lines.  Or hire a dev.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, the last line doesn't do you any good; <code>readlines()</code> doesn't "split out each line", it just copies all of those lines, exactly as-is, into a list, which is no better than the iterable you already had (the file). And meanwhile, you haven't written any attempt at iterating over the lines, or splitting each line, or parsing the parts you've split. So, you're just asking us to do your assignment for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you need some hints to get started: Each line in the file is a <code>str</code>; you can do all the splitting and parsing with nothing but one or two of the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str</code> methods</a>. Or you can make it a bit more compact with a regular expression, but if you don't know what that is, don't worry about it. If you try it either way and get stuck, then you'll have a good question to ask on SO.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks so much John! I'll take that into consideration!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem here is I literally have no idea where to go. I know I can iterate through the file with a for loop but it is just splitting at IP. So maybe I can split at whatever charter number the start of the IP is to the end of the IP and do the same for port. If that makes any sense.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3002598, is there something wrong with my answer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No your answer was good. I just hadn't visited Stack in awhile. Got the question done and all is well. Thanks!</span>
