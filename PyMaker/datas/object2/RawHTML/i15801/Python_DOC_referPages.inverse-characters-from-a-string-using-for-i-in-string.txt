<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In python is there a way to inverse a string using a 'for i in string' but starting from the last char rather than the first? I would like to avoid using a counte rand I do not want to use INVERSE.
Thanks for the feedback!</p>
<pre><code>string = 'caramelosticosis'
new_string = ''
cont = 0
for i in string:
    cont+=1
    new_string += string[-cont]



print(new_string)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Easiest way is to just use a slice:</p>
<pre><code>text = 'caramelosticosis'
print(text[::-1])
</code></pre>
<p>(By the way, best not to use <code>string</code> as a variable name as it is also the name of a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html" rel="nofollow">module</a>)</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You mean "reverse"?  Try reverse(string) or string[::-1] in your loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">May I ask <i>why</i> you are subject to these constraints? The best way to do it would just be <code>new_string = string[::-1]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well, they are not necesarily constraints, Just wanted to know if there is an alternate for i in 'string', but kind of inverse. but the answer provided by you and dmcc are super!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes - i actually used chaine, but for reference purposes i wrote string, Thanks!</span>
