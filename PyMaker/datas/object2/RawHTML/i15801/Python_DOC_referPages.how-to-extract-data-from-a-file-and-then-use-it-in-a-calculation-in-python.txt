<p>I want to extract data from one of my files, and then use it in a calculation in Python. Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>def c_p_d():
    d=open("C:\\p_d.txt","a")
    d.close()
    b=open("C:\\p_d.txt","r")
    c=b.readlines()
    a=float(input("is "+str(c)+" the conversion rate of pounds to dollars? Type 1 for yes and 0 for no."))
    if a==1:
        b=float(input("How many Â£ do you want to convert?"))
        b2=b*c
        print(float(b2))
</code></pre>
<p>How can I use the data in a calculation? I want to take the data in my text file and multiply that by the number that the user has input.</p>

<p>A few comments (and an answer):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>c</code> is a list of strings (returned by the <code>.readlines()</code> method). If all the file contains is just one number (the conversion rate), then <code>.read()</code> would be better because it returns a string.</li>
<li>But even then, you can't do calculations with <code>c</code> yet - you need to do a conversion to a  <code>float</code> first. In your case, you'd have to do something like <code>c = float(c[0])</code> if the number is on the first line in your file. (With <code>.read()</code>, it would be <code>c = float(c)</code> - do you understand why?)</li>
<li>Why are you opening the file in append mode at the start of your function, only to close it immediately afterwards?</li>
<li>Have you read about the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>with</code> statement</a>?</li>
<li>You should be using better variable names. <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>b2</code>, <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> don't speak for themselves. Your computer has enough memory to store longer variable names.</li>
<li>You should read <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP-8 (Style Guide for Python code)</a></li>
<li>You should read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/formatting">How do I format my posts using Markdown or HTML?</a> in order to avoid issues with improper indentation like in your question.</li>

<span class="comment-copy">It is <i>very</i> difficult to make sense of what you are trying to do. Please 1) give us what language you are using 2) try to make your code a bit more concise and 3) be much more explicit in your question. What have you tried? What specifically isn't working for you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">im using python and i want to be able to take the data in my text file and times that by the number that the user has imputed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How is formated the input? how is structured data within the p_d.Txt files? are they line-separated numbers? coma-separated? are they in an other format?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you soo much.As you can probably tell im quite new too python  and thats why i use them bad variable names.</span>
