<p>Python3 Format String Syntax Ref: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It has no special meaning. It just inserts a <code>$</code> character:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "(%d goals, $%d)" % (10, 42)
'(10 goals, $42)'
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes a dollar is <em>just</em> a dollar.</p>
<p>You also linked to the wrong documentation; the formatting syntax documented there only applies to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format" rel="noreferrer"><code>format()</code> function</a> and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="noreferrer"><code>str.format()</code> method</a>. You want to look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting" rel="noreferrer"><em><code>printf</code>-style String Formatting</em> section</a> instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you consider just trying the expression? <code>"(%d goals, $%d)" % (42, 42)</code> immediately shows me that the <code>$</code> sign goes straight to the output string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Upvoted. This is a perfectly legitimate question, and if I was a new user, I'd suspect that <code>$%</code> was some operator. We must try to be helpful and respectful to new users. (I remember when I used to do PERL and dabbled in PHP, it was like getting slowly beaten to death by the ASCII character set)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are right about wrong doc link... and thanks!  Clearly, my Python gears are rusty...</span>
