<p>Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(a=[]):
    a.append(5)
    return a
</code></pre>
<p>Python novices would expect this function to always return a list with only one element: <code>[5]</code>. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5, 5, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5, 5, 5, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
</code></pre>
<p>A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it "a dramatic design flaw" of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: </p>
<p>Baczek made an interesting example. Together with most of your comments and Utaal's in particular, I elaborated further:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def a():
...     print("a executed")
...     return []
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;            
&gt;&gt;&gt; def b(x=a()):
...     x.append(5)
...     print(x)
... 
a executed
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5, 5]
</code></pre>
<p>To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function or "together" with it?</p>
<p>Doing the binding inside the function would mean that <code>x</code> is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the <code>def</code> line would be "hybrid" in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.</p>
<p>The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Actually, this is not a design flaw, and it is not because of internals, or performance.<br/>
It comes simply from the fact that functions in Python are first-class objects, and not only a piece of code.</p>
<p>As soon as you get to think into this way, then it completely makes sense: a function is an object being evaluated on its definition; default parameters are kind of "member data" and therefore their state may change from one call to the other - exactly as in any other object.</p>
<p>In any case, Effbot has a very nice explanation of the reasons for this behavior in <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm" rel="noreferrer">Default Parameter Values in Python</a>.<br/>
I found it very clear, and I really suggest reading it for a better knowledge of how function objects work.</p>

<p>Suppose you have the following code</p>
<pre><code>fruits = ("apples", "bananas", "loganberries")

def eat(food=fruits):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>When I see the declaration of eat, the least astonishing thing is to think that if the first parameter is not given, that it will be equal to the tuple <code>("apples", "bananas", "loganberries")</code></p>
<p>However, supposed later on in the code, I do something like</p>
<pre><code>def some_random_function():
    global fruits
    fruits = ("blueberries", "mangos")
</code></pre>
<p>then if default parameters were bound at function execution rather than function declaration then I would be astonished (in a very bad way) to discover that fruits had been changed.  This would be more astonishing IMO than discovering that your <code>foo</code> function above was mutating the list.</p>
<p>The real problem lies with mutable variables, and all languages have this problem to some extent. Here's a question: suppose in Java I have the following code:</p>
<pre class="lang-java prettyprint-override"><code>StringBuffer s = new StringBuffer("Hello World!");
Map&lt;StringBuffer,Integer&gt; counts = new HashMap&lt;StringBuffer,Integer&gt;();
counts.put(s, 5);
s.append("!!!!");
System.out.println( counts.get(s) );  // does this work?
</code></pre>
<p>Now, does my map use the value of the <code>StringBuffer</code> key when it was placed into the map, or does it store the key by reference?  Either way, someone is astonished; either the person who tried to get the object out of the <code>Map</code> using a value identical to the one they put it in with, or the person who can't seem to retrieve their object even though the key they're using is literally the same object that was used to put it into the map (this is actually why Python doesn't allow its mutable built-in data types to be used as dictionary keys).</p>
<p>Your example is a good one of a case where Python newcomers will be surprised and bitten.  But I'd argue that if we "fixed" this, then that would only create a different situation where they'd be bitten instead, and that one would be even less intuitive. Moreover, this is always the case when dealing with mutable variables; you always run into cases where someone could intuitively expect one or the opposite behavior depending on what code they're writing.</p>
<p>I personally like Python's current approach: default function arguments are evaluated when the function is defined and that object is always the default. I suppose they could special-case using an empty list, but that kind of special casing would cause even more astonishment, not to mention be backwards incompatible.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>AFAICS no one has yet posted the relevant part of the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/compound_stmts.html#function-definitions">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Default parameter values are evaluated when the function definition is executed.</strong> This means that the expression is evaluated once, when the function is defined, and that the same “pre-computed” value is used for each call. This is especially important to understand when a default parameter is a mutable object, such as a list or a dictionary: if the function modifies the object (e.g. by appending an item to a list), the default value is in effect modified. This is generally not what was intended. A way around this is to use None as the default, and explicitly test for it in the body of the function [...]</p>

<p>I know nothing about the Python interpreter inner workings (and I'm not an expert in compilers and interpreters either) so don't blame me if I propose anything unsensible or impossible.</p>
<p>Provided that python objects <strong>are mutable</strong> I think that this should be taken into account when designing the default arguments stuff.
When you instantiate a list:</p>
<pre><code>a = []
</code></pre>
<p>you expect to get a <strong>new</strong> list referenced by <em>a</em>.</p>
<p>Why should the a=[] in</p>
<pre><code>def x(a=[]):
</code></pre>
<p>instantiate a new list on function definition and not on invocation?
It's just like you're asking "if the user doesn't provide the argument then <em>instantiate</em> a new list and use it as if it was produced by the caller".
I think this is ambiguous instead:</p>
<pre><code>def x(a=datetime.datetime.now()):
</code></pre>
<p>user, do you want <em>a</em> to default to the datetime corresponding to when you're defining or executing <em>x</em>?
In this case, as in the previous one, I'll keep the same behaviour as if the default argument "assignment" was the first instruction of the function (datetime.now() called on function invocation).
On the other hand, if the user wanted the definition-time mapping he could write:</p>
<pre><code>b = datetime.datetime.now()
def x(a=b):
</code></pre>
<p>I know, I know: that's a closure. Alternatively Python might provide a keyword to force definition-time binding:</p>
<pre><code>def x(static a=b):
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Well, the reason is quite simply that bindings are done when code is executed, and the function definition is executed, well... when the functions is defined.</p>
<p>Compare this:</p>
<pre><code>class BananaBunch:
    bananas = []

    def addBanana(self, banana):
        self.bananas.append(banana)
</code></pre>
<p>This code suffers from the exact same unexpected happenstance. bananas is a class attribute, and hence, when you add things to it, it's added to all instances of that class. The reason is exactly the same.</p>
<p>It's just "How It Works", and making it work differently in the function case would probably be complicated, and in the class case likely impossible, or at least slow down object instantiation a lot, as you would have to keep the class code around and execute it when objects are created.</p>
<p>Yes, it is unexpected. But once the penny drops, it fits in perfectly with how Python works in general. In fact, it's a good teaching aid, and once you understand why this happens, you'll grok python much better.</p>
<p>That said it should feature prominently in any good Python tutorial. Because as you mention, everyone runs into this problem sooner or later.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I used to think that creating the objects at runtime would be the better approach.  I'm less certain now, since you do lose some useful features, though it may be worth it regardless simply to prevent newbie confusion.  The disadvantages of doing so are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Performance</strong></p>
<pre><code>def foo(arg=something_expensive_to_compute())):
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>If call-time evaluation is used, then the expensive function is called every time your function is used without an argument.  You'd either pay an expensive price on each call, or need to manually cache the value externally, polluting your namespace and adding verbosity.</p>
<p><strong>2. Forcing bound parameters</strong></p>
<p>A useful trick is to bind parameters of a lambda to the <em>current</em> binding of a variable when the lambda is created.  For example:</p>
<pre><code>funcs = [ lambda i=i: i for i in range(10)]
</code></pre>
<p>This returns a list of functions that return 0,1,2,3... respectively.  If the behaviour is changed, they will instead bind <code>i</code> to the <em>call-time</em> value of i, so you would get a list of functions that all returned <code>9</code>.</p>
<p>The only way to implement this otherwise would be to create a further closure with the i bound, ie:</p>
<pre><code>def make_func(i): return lambda: i
funcs = [make_func(i) for i in range(10)]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>3. Introspection</strong></p>
<p>Consider the code:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(a='test', b=100, c=[]):
   print a,b,c
</code></pre>
<p>We can get information about the arguments and defaults using the <code>inspect</code> module, which </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; inspect.getargspec(foo)
(['a', 'b', 'c'], None, None, ('test', 100, []))
</code></pre>
<p>This information is very useful for things like document generation, metaprogramming, decorators etc.</p>
<p>Now, suppose the behaviour of defaults could be changed so that this is the equivalent of:</p>
<pre><code>_undefined = object()  # sentinel value

def foo(a=_undefined, b=_undefined, c=_undefined)
    if a is _undefined: a='test'
    if b is _undefined: b=100
    if c is _undefined: c=[]
</code></pre>
<p>However, we've lost the ability to introspect, and see what the default arguments <em>are</em>.  Because the objects haven't been constructed, we can't ever get hold of them without actually calling the function.  The best we could do is to store off the source code and return that as a string.</p>

<h1>5 points in defense of Python</h1>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Simplicity</strong>: The behavior is simple in the following sense:
Most people fall into this trap only once, not several times.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Python <em>always</em> passes objects, not names.
The default parameter is, obviously, part of the function 
heading (not the function body). It therefore ought to be evaluated
at module load time (and only at module load time, unless nested), not
at function call time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Usefulness</strong>: As Frederik Lundh points out in his explanation
of <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm#valid-uses-for-mutable-defaults">"Default Parameter Values in Python"</a>, the
current behavior can be quite useful for advanced programming.
(Use sparingly.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sufficient documentation</strong>: In the most basic Python documentation,
the tutorial, the issue is loudly announced as
an <strong>"Important warning"</strong> in the <em>first</em> subsection of Section
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values">"More on Defining Functions"</a>.
The warning even uses boldface,
which is rarely applied outside of headings.
RTFM: Read the fine manual.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meta-learning</strong>: Falling into the trap is actually a very
helpful moment (at least if you are a reflective learner),
because you will subsequently better understand the point 
"Consistency" above and that will
teach you a great deal about Python.</p></li>

<h2>Why don't you introspect?</h2>
<p>I'm <em>really</em> surprised no one has performed the insightful introspection offered by Python (<code>2</code> and <code>3</code> apply) on callables. </p>
<p>Given a simple little function <code>func</code> defined as:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def func(a = []):
...    a.append(5)
</code></pre>
<p>When Python encounters it, the first thing it will do is compile it in order to create a <code>code</code> object for this function. While this compilation step is done, <em>Python <strong>evaluates</strong>* and then <strong>stores</strong> the default arguments (an empty list <code>[]</code> here) in the function object itself</em>. As the top answer mentioned: the list <code>a</code> can now be considered a <em>member</em> of the function <code>func</code>.</p>
<p>So, let's do some introspection, a before and after to examine how the list gets expanded <strong>inside</strong> the function object. I'm using <code>Python 3.x</code> for this, for Python 2 the same applies (use <code>__defaults__</code> or <code>func_defaults</code> in Python 2; yes, two names for the same thing).</p>
<h3>Function Before Execution:</h3>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def func(a = []):
...     a.append(5)
...     
</code></pre>
<p>After Python executes this definition it will take any default parameters specified (<code>a = []</code> here) and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy" rel="noreferrer">cram them in the <code>__defaults__</code> attribute for the function object</a> (relevant section: Callables):     </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; func.__defaults__
([],)
</code></pre>
<p>O.k, so an empty list as the single entry in <code>__defaults__</code>, just as expected. </p>
<h3>Function After Execution:</h3>
<p>Let's now execute this function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; func()
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's see those <code>__defaults__</code> again: </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; func.__defaults__
([5],)
</code></pre>
<p><em>Astonished?</em> The value inside the object changes! Consecutive calls to the function will now simply append to that embedded <code>list</code> object:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; func(); func(); func()
&gt;&gt;&gt; func.__defaults__
([5, 5, 5, 5],)
</code></pre>
<p>So, there you have it, the reason why this <em>'flaw'</em> happens, is because default arguments are part of the function object. There's nothing weird going on here, it's all just a bit surprising.</p>
<p>The common solution to combat this is to use <code>None</code> as the default and then initialize in the function body:</p>
<pre><code>def func(a = None):
    # or: a = [] if a is None else a
    if a is None:
        a = []
</code></pre>
<p>Since the function body is executed anew each time, you always get a fresh new empty list if no argument was passed for <code>a</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>To further verify that the list in <code>__defaults__</code> is the same as that used in the function <code>func</code> you can just change your function to return the <code>id</code> of the list <code>a</code> used inside the function body. Then, compare it to the list in <code>__defaults__</code> (position <code>[0]</code> in <code>__defaults__</code>) and you'll see how these are indeed refering to the same list instance:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def func(a = []): 
...     a.append(5)
...     return id(a)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; id(func.__defaults__[0]) == func()
True
</code></pre>
<p>All with the power of introspection! </p>
<hr/>
<p><sup>*</sup> To verify that Python evaluates the default arguments during compilation of the function, try executing the following:</p>
<pre><code>def bar(a=input('Did you just see me without calling the function?')): 
    pass  # use raw_input in Py2
</code></pre>
<p>as you'll notice, <code>input()</code> is called before the process of building the function and binding it to the name <code>bar</code> is made.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This behavior is easy explained by:</p>
<ol>
<li>function (class etc.) declaration is executed only once, creating all default value objects</li>
<li>everything is passed by reference</li>
</ol>
<p>So:</p>
<pre><code>def x(a=0, b=[], c=[], d=0):
    a = a + 1
    b = b + [1]
    c.append(1)
    print a, b, c
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><code>a</code> doesn't change - every assignment call creates new int object - new object is printed</li>
<li><code>b</code> doesn't change - new array is build from default value and printed</li>
<li><code>c</code> changes - operation is performed on same object - and it is printed</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you're asking is why this:</p>
<pre><code>def func(a=[], b = 2):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>isn't internally equivalent to this:</p>
<pre><code>def func(a=None, b = None):
    a_default = lambda: []
    b_default = lambda: 2
    def actual_func(a=None, b=None):
        if a is None: a = a_default()
        if b is None: b = b_default()
    return actual_func
func = func()
</code></pre>
<p>except for the case of explicitly calling func(None, None), which we'll ignore.</p>
<p>In other words, instead of evaluating default parameters, why not store each of them, and evaluate them when the function is called?</p>
<p>One answer is probably right there--it would effectively turn every function with default parameters into a closure.  Even if it's all hidden away in the interpreter and not a full-blown closure, the data's got to be stored somewhere.  It'd be slower and use more memory.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>1)  The so-called problem of "Mutable Default Argument" is in general a special example demonstrating that:<br/>
"All functions with this problem <strong>suffer also from similar side effect problem on the actual parameter</strong>,"<br/>
That is against the rules of functional programming, usually undesiderable and should be fixed both together.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(a=[]):                 # the same problematic function
    a.append(5)
    return a

&gt;&gt;&gt; somevar = [1, 2]           # an example without a default parameter

[1, 2, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; somevar
[1, 2, 5]                      # usually expected [1, 2]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:  a <strong>copy</strong><br/>
An absolutely safe solution is to <strong><code>copy</code></strong> or <strong><code>deepcopy</code></strong> the input object first and then to do whatever with the copy.</p>
<pre><code>def foo(a=[]):
    a = a[:]     # a copy
    a.append(5)
    return a     # or everything safe by one line: "return a + [5]"
</code></pre>
<p>Many builtin mutable types have a copy method like <code>some_dict.copy()</code> or <code>some_set.copy()</code> or can be copied easy like <code>somelist[:]</code> or <code>list(some_list)</code>. Every object can be also copied by <code>copy.copy(any_object)</code> or more thorough by <code>copy.deepcopy()</code> (the latter useful if the mutable object is composed from mutable objects). Some objects are fundamentally based on side effects like "file" object and can not be meaningfully reproduced by copy. <a href="http://effbot.org/pyfaq/how-do-i-copy-an-object-in-python.htm" rel="noreferrer">copying</a></p>
<p>Example problem for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/13484107/448474">a similar SO question</a></p>

t1 = Test(somevar)

<p>It shouldn't be neither saved in any <em>public</em> attribute of an instance returned by this function. (Assuming that <em>private</em> attributes of instance should not be modified from outside of this class or subclasses by convention. i.e. <code>_var1</code> is a private attribute )</p>
<p>Conclusion:<br/>
Input parameters objects shouldn't be modified in place (mutated) nor they should not be binded into an object returned by the function.

<p>This actually has nothing to do with default values, other than that it often comes up as an unexpected behaviour when you write functions with mutable default values.</p>

<p>No default values in sight in this code, but you get exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>The problem is that <code>foo</code> is <em>modifying</em> a mutable variable passed in from the caller, when the caller doesn't expect this. Code like this would be fine if the function was called something like <code>append_5</code>; then the caller would be calling the function in order to modify the value they pass in, and the behaviour would be expected. But such a function would be very unlikely to take a default argument, and probably wouldn't return the list (since the caller already has a reference to that list; the one it just passed in).</p>
<p>Your original <code>foo</code>, with a default argument, shouldn't be modifying <code>a</code> whether it was explicitly passed in or got the default value. Your code should leave mutable arguments alone unless it is clear from the context/name/documentation that the arguments are supposed to be modified. Using mutable values passed in as arguments as local temporaries is an extremely bad idea, whether we're in Python or not and whether there are default arguments involved or not.</p>
<p>If you need to destructively manipulate a local temporary in the course of computing something, and you need to start your manipulation from an argument value, you need to make a copy.</p>

<p>As you can see, there <em>is</em> a performance benefit when using immutable default arguments.  This can make a difference if it's a frequently called function or the default argument takes a long time to construct.  Also, bear in mind that Python isn't C.  In C you have constants that are pretty much free.  In Python you don't have this benefit.</p>

<p>The shortest answer would probably be "definition is execution", therefore the whole argument makes no strict sense. As a more contrived example, you may cite this:</p>
<pre><code>def a(): return []

def b(x=a()):
    print x

<p>Hopefully it's enough to show that not executing the default argument expressions at the execution time of the <code>def</code> statement isn't easy or doesn't make sense, or both.</p>

<h1>Python: The Mutable Default Argument</h1>
<p>Default arguments get evaluated at the time the function is compiled into a function object. When used by the function, multiple times by that function, they are and remain the same object. </p>
<p>When they are mutable, when mutated (for example, by adding an element to it) they remain mutated on consecutive calls.</p>
<p>They stay mutated because they are the same object each time.</p>
<h2>Equivalent code:</h2>
<p>Since the list is bound to the function when the function object is compiled and instantiated, this:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(mutable_default_argument=[]): # make a list the default argument
    """function that uses a list"""
</code></pre>
<p>is almost exactly equivalent to this:</p>
<pre><code>_a_list = [] # create a list in the globals

def foo(mutable_default_argument=_a_list): # make it the default argument
    """function that uses a list"""

del _a_list # remove globals name binding

<h2>Demonstration</h2>
<p>Here's a demonstration - you can verify that they are the same object each time they are referenced by </p>
<ul>
<li>seeing that the list is created before the function has finished compiling to a function object,</li>
<li>observing that the id is the same each time the list is referenced,</li>
<li>observing that the list stays changed when the function that uses it is called a second time,</li>
<li>observing the order in which the output is printed from the source (which I conveniently numbered for you):</li>

<h2>Does this violate the principle of "Least Astonishment"?</h2>
<p>This order of execution is frequently confusing to new users of Python. If you understand the Python execution model, then it becomes quite expected. </p>
<h2>The usual instruction to new Python users:</h2>
<p>But this is why the usual instruction to new users is to create their default arguments like this instead:</p>
<pre><code>def example_function_2(default_kwarg=None):
    if default_kwarg is None:
        default_kwarg = []
</code></pre>
<p>This uses the None singleton as a sentinel object to tell the function whether or not we've gotten an argument other than the default. If we get no argument, then we actually want to use a new empty list, <code>[]</code>, as the default.</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values" rel="noreferrer">tutorial section on control flow</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls,
  you can write the function like this instead:</p>
<pre><code>def f(a, L=None):
    if L is None:
        L = []
    L.append(a)
    return L
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This behavior is not surprising if you take the following into consideration:</p>
<ol>
<li>The behavior of read-only class attributes upon assignment attempts, and that</li>
<li>Functions are objects (explained well in the accepted answer). </li>
</ol>
<p>The role of <strong>(2)</strong> has been covered extensively in this thread. <strong>(1)</strong> is likely the astonishment causing factor, as this behavior is not "intuitive" when coming from other languages.</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> is described in the Python <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html">tutorial on classes</a>. In an attempt to assign a value to a read-only class attribute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...all variables found outside of the innermost scope are
  read-only (<strong><em>an attempt to write to such a variable will simply create a
  new local variable in the innermost scope, leaving the identically
  named outer variable unchanged</em></strong>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look back to the original example and consider the above points:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(a=[]):
    a.append(5)
    return a
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>foo</code> is an object and <code>a</code> is an attribute of <code>foo</code> (available at <code>foo.func_defs[0]</code>). Since <code>a</code> is a list, <code>a</code> is mutable and is thus a read-write attribute of <code>foo</code>. It is initialized to the empty list as specified by the signature when the function is instantiated, and is available for reading and writing as long as the function object exists. </p>
<p>Calling <code>foo</code> without overriding a default uses that default's value from <code>foo.func_defs</code>. In this case, <code>foo.func_defs[0]</code> is used for <code>a</code> within function object's code scope. Changes to <code>a</code> change <code>foo.func_defs[0]</code>, which is part of the <code>foo</code> object and persists between execution of the code in <code>foo</code>.</p>
<p>Now, compare this to the example from the documentation on <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values">emulating the default argument behavior of other languages</a>, such that the function signature defaults are used every time the function is executed:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(a, L=None):
    if L is None:
        L = []
    L.append(a)
    return L
</code></pre>
<p>Taking <strong>(1)</strong> and <strong>(2)</strong> into account, one can see why this accomplishes the the desired behavior: </p>
<ul>
<li>When the <code>foo</code> function object is instantiated, <code>foo.func_defs[0]</code> is set to <code>None</code>, an immutable object.</li>
<li>When the function is executed with defaults (with no parameter specified for <code>L</code> in the function call), <code>foo.func_defs[0]</code> (<code>None</code>) is available in the local scope as <code>L</code>.</li>
<li>Upon <code>L = []</code>, the assignment cannot succeed at <code>foo.func_defs[0]</code>, because that attribute is read-only. </li>
<li>Per <strong>(1)</strong>, <strong><em>a new local variable also named <code>L</code> is created in the local scope</em></strong> and used for the remainder of the function call. <code>foo.func_defs[0]</code> thus remains unchanged for future invocations of <code>foo</code>.</li>

<p>I am going to demonstrate an alternative structure to pass a default list value to a function (it works equally well with dictionaries).  </p>
<p>As others have extensively commented, the list parameter is bound to the function when it is defined as opposed to when it is executed.  Because lists and dictionaries are mutable, any alteration to this parameter will affect other calls to this function.  As a result, subsequent calls to the function will receive this shared list which may have been altered by any other calls to the function.  Worse yet, two parameters are using this function's shared parameter at the same time oblivious to the changes made by the other.</p>

<p>I think the answer to this question lies in how python pass data to parameter (pass by value or by reference), not mutability or how python handle the "def" statement.</p>
<p>A brief introduction. First, there are two type of data types in python, one is simple elementary data type, like numbers, and another data type is objects. Second, when passing data to parameters, python pass elementary data type by value, i.e., make a local copy of the value to a local variable, but pass object by reference, i.e., pointers to the object.</p>
<p>Admitting the above two points, let's explain what happened to the python code. It's only because of passing by reference for objects, but has nothing to do with mutable/immutable, or arguably the fact that "def" statement is executed only once when it is defined.</p>
<p>[] is an object, so python pass the reference of [] to <code>a</code>, i.e., <code>a</code> is only a pointer to [] which lies in memory as an object. There is only one copy of [] with, however, many references to it. For the first foo(), the list [] is changed to <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm" rel="noreferrer">1</a> by append method. But Note that there is only one copy of the list object and this object now becomes <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm" rel="noreferrer">1</a>. When running the second foo(), what effbot webpage says (items is not evaluated any more) is wrong. <code>a</code> is evaluated to be the list object, although now the content of the object is <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm" rel="noreferrer">1</a>. This is the effect of passing by reference! The result of foo(3) can be easily derived in the same way.</p>
<p>To further validate my answer, let's take a look at two additional codes.</p>
<p>====== No. 2 ========</p>
<pre><code>def foo(x, items=None):
    if items is None:
        items = []
    items.append(x)
    return items

foo(1)  #return [1]
foo(2)  #return [2]
foo(3)  #return [3]
</code></pre>
<p><code>[]</code> is an object, so is <code>None</code> (the former is mutable while the latter is immutable. But the mutability has nothing to do with the question). None is somewhere in the space but we know it's there and there is only one copy of None there. So every time foo is invoked, items is evaluated (as opposed to some answer that it is only evaluated once) to be None, to be clear, the reference (or the address) of None. Then in the foo, item is changed to [], i.e., points to another object which has a different address. </p>
<p>====== No. 3 =======</p>
<pre><code>def foo(x, items=[]):
    items.append(x)
    return items

foo(1)    # returns [1]
foo(2,[]) # returns [2]
foo(3)    # returns [1,3]
</code></pre>
<p>The invocation of foo(1) make items point to a list object [] with an address, say, 11111111. the content of the list is changed to <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm" rel="noreferrer">1</a> in the foo function in the sequel, but the address is not changed, still 11111111. Then foo(2,[]) is coming. Although the [] in foo(2,[]) has the same content as the default parameter [] when calling foo(1), their address are different! Since we provide the parameter explicitly, <code>items</code> has to take the address of this new <code>[]</code>, say 2222222, and return it after making some change. Now foo(3) is executed. since only <code>x</code> is provided, items has to take its default value again. What's the default value? It is set when defining the foo function: the list object located in 11111111. So the items is evaluated to be the address 11111111 having an element 1. The list located at 2222222 also contains one element 2, but it is not pointed by items any more. Consequently, An append of 3 will make <code>items</code> [1,3]. </p>
<p>From the above explanations, we can see that the <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/default-values.htm" rel="noreferrer">effbot</a> webpage recommended in the accepted answer failed to give a relevant answer to this question. What is more, I think a point in the effbot webpage is wrong. I think the code regarding the UI.Button is correct:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    def callback():
        print "clicked button", i
    UI.Button("button %s" % i, callback)
</code></pre>
<p>Each button can hold a distinct callback function which will display different value of <code>i</code>. I can provide an example to show this:</p>
<pre><code>x=[]
for i in range(10):
    def callback():
        print(i)
    x.append(callback) 
</code></pre>
<p>If we execute <code>x[7]()</code> we'll get 7 as expected, and <code>x[9]()</code> will gives 9, another value of <code>i</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><em>This is not a design flaw</em>. Anyone who trips over this is doing something wrong.</p>
<p>There are 3 cases I see where you might run into this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>You intend to modify the argument as a side effect of the function. In this case it <em>never makes sense</em> to have a default argument. The only exception is when you're abusing the argument list to have function attributes, e.g. <code>cache={}</code>, and you wouldn't be expected to call the function with an actual argument at all.</li>
<li>You intend to leave the argument unmodified, but you accidentally <em>did</em> modify it. That's a bug, fix it.</li>
<li>You intend to modify the argument for use inside the function, but didn't expect the modification to be viewable outside of the function. In that case you need to make a <em>copy</em> of the argument, whether it was the default or not! Python is not a call-by-value language so it doesn't make the copy for you, you need to be explicit about it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The example in the question could fall into category 1 or 3. It's odd that it both modifies the passed list and returns it; you should pick one or the other.</p>

<p>TLDR: Define-time defaults are consistent and strictly more expressive.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Defining a function affects two scopes: the defining scope <em>containing</em> the function, and the execution  scope <em>contained by</em> the function. While it is pretty clear how blocks map to scopes, the question is where <code>def &lt;name&gt;(&lt;args=defaults&gt;):</code> belongs to:</p>
<pre><code>...                           # defining scope
def name(parameter=default):  # ???
    ...                       # execution scope
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>def name</code> part <strong>must</strong> evaluate in the defining scope - we want <code>name</code> to be available there, after all. Evaluating the function only inside itself would make it inaccessible.</p>
<p>Since <code>parameter</code> is a constant name, we can "evaluate" it at the same time as <code>def name</code>. This also has the advantage it produces the function with a known signature as <code>name(parameter=...):</code>, instead of a bare <code>name(...):</code>.</p>
<p>Now, when to evaluate <code>default</code>?</p>
<p>Consistency already says "at definition": everything else of <code>def &lt;name&gt;(&lt;args=defaults&gt;):</code> is best evaluated at definition as well. Delaying parts of it would be the astonishing choice.</p>
<p>The two choices are not equivalent, either: If <code>default</code> is evaluated at definition time, it <em>can still</em> affect execution time. If <code>default</code> is evaluated at execution time, it <em>cannot</em> affect definition time. Choosing "at definition" allows expressing both cases, while choosing "at execution" can express only one:</p>
<pre><code>def name(parameter=defined):  # set default at definition time
    ...

def name(parameter=None):     # delay default until execution time
    parameter = [] if parameter is None else parameter

<span class="comment-copy">My argument when I come across this is:  "Why do you need to create a function that returns a mutable that could optionally be a mutable you would pass to the function?  Either it alters a mutable or creates a new one.  Why do you need to do both with one function?  And why should the interpreter be rewritten to allow you to do that without adding three lines to your code?" Because we are talking about rewriting the way the interpreter handles function definitions and evocations here.  That's a lot to do for a barely necessary use case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"Python novices would expect this function to always return a list with only one element: <code>[5]</code>." I'm a Python novice, and I wouldn't expect this, because obviously <code>foo([1])</code> will return <code>[1, 5]</code>, not <code>[5]</code>. What you meant to say is that a novice would expect the function <i>called with no parameter</i> will always return <code>[5]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values" rel="nofollow noreferrer">example in Python tutorial</a>, why is <code>if L is None:</code> needed? I removed this test and it made no difference</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To anyone reading the above answer, I strongly recommend you take the time to read through the linked Effbot article. As well as all the other useful info, the part on how this language feature can be used for result caching/memoisation is very handy to know!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Even if it's a first-class object, one might still envision a design where the <i>code</i> for each default value is stored along with the object and re-evaluated each time the function is called. I'm not saying that would be better, just that functions being first-class objects does not fully preclude it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, but anything considered "The biggest WTF in Python" is <b>most definitely a design flaw</b>.  This is a source of bugs for <i>everyone</i> at some point, because no one expects that behavior at first - which means it should not have been designed that way to begin with.  I don't care what hoops they had to jump through, they <b>should</b> have designed Python so that default arguments are non-static.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Whether or not it's a design flaw, your answer seems to imply that this behaviour is somehow necessary, natural and obvious given that functions are first-class objects, and that simply isn't the case. Python has closures. If you replace the default argument with an assignment on the first line of the function, it evaluates the expression each call (potentially using names declared in an enclosing scope). There is no reason at all that it wouldn't be possible or reasonable to have default arguments evaluated each time the function is called in exactly the same way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The design doesn't directly follow from <code>functions are objects</code>. In your paradigm, the proposal would be to implement functions' default values as properties rather than attributes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think it's a matter of debate. You are acting on a global variable. Any evaluation performed anywhere in your code involving your global variable will now (correctly) refer to ("blueberries", "mangos"). the default parameter could just be like any other case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, I don't think I agree with your first example.  I'm not sure I like the idea of modifying an initializer like that in the first place, but if I did, I'd expect it to behave exactly as you describe — changing the default value to <code>("blueberries", "mangos")</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The default parameter <i>is</i> like any other case. What is unexpected is that the parameter is a global variable, and not a local one. Which in turn is because the code is executed at function definition, not call. Once you get that, and that the same goes for classes, it's perfectly clear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I find the example misleading rather than brilliant. If <code>some_random_function()</code> appends to <code>fruits</code> instead of assigning to it, the behaviour of <code>eat()</code> <i>will</i> change. So much for the current wonderful design. If you use a default argument that's referenced elsewhere and then modify the reference from outside the function, you are asking for trouble. The real WTF is when people define a fresh default argument (a list literal or a call to a constructor), and <i>still</i> get bit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You just explicitly declared <code>global</code> and reassigned the tuple - there is absolutely nothing surprising if <code>eat</code> works differently after that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The phrases "this is not generally what was intended" and "a way around this is" smell like they're documenting a design flaw.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matthew: I'm well aware, but it's not worth the pitfall. You'll generally see style guides and linters unconditionally flag mutable default values as wrong for this reason. The explicit way to do the same thing is to stuff an attribute onto the function (<code>function.data = []</code>) or better yet, make an object.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bukzor: Pitfalls need to be noted and documented, which is why this question is good and has received so many upvotes. At the same time, pitfalls don't necessarily need to be removed. How many Python beginners have passed a list to a function that modified it, and were shocked to see the changes show up in the original variable? Yet mutable object types are wonderful, when you understand how to use them. I guess it just boils down to opinion on this particular pitfall.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The phrase "this is not generally what was intended" means "not what the programmer actually wanted to happen," not "not what Python is supposed to do."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@oriadam Maybe you might want to post a question about it then. Maybe you do something different than what was intended...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could do: def x(a=None): And then, if a is None, set a=datetime.datetime.now()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for this. I couldn't really put my finger on why this  irks me to no end. You have done it beautifully with a minimum of fuzz and confusion. As someone comming from systems programming in C++ and sometimes naively "translating" language features, this false friend kicked me in the in the soft of the head big time, just like class attributes. I understand why things are this way, but I cannot help but dislike it, no matter what positive might come of it. At least it is so contrary to my experience, that I'll probably (hopefully) never forget it...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Andreas once you use Python for long enough, you begin to see how logical it is for Python to interpret things as class attributes the way it does - it is only because of the particular quirks and limitations of languages like C++ (and Java, and C#...) that it makes any sense for contents of the <code>class {}</code> block to be interpreted as belonging to the <i>instances</i> :) But when classes are first-class objects, obviously the natural thing is for their contents (in memory) to reflect their contents (in code).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Normative structure is no quirk or limitation in my book. I know it can be clumsy and ugly, but you can call it a "definition" of something. The dynamic languages seem a bit like anarchists to me: Sure everybody is free, but you need structure to get someone to empty the trash and pave the road. Guess I'm old... :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The function <b>definition</b> is executed at module load time. The function <b>body</b> is executed at function call time. The default argument is part of the function definition, not of the function body. (It gets more complicated for nested functions.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do you define a class attribute that is different for each instance of a class?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If it's different for each instance it's not a class attribute. Class attributes are attributes on the CLASS. Hence the name. Hence they are the same for all instances.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do you define an attribute in a class that is different for each instance of a class? (Re-defined for those who could not determine that a person not familiar with Python's naming convenctions might be asking about normal member variables of a class).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kievieli: You ARE talking about normal member variables of a class. :-)  You define instance attributes by saying self.attribute = value in any method. For example __init__().</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kieveli: Two answers:  you can't, because any thing you define at a class level will be a class attribute, and any instance that accesses that attribute will access the same class attribute; you can, /sort of/, by using <code>property</code>s -- which are actually class level functions that act like normal attributes but save the attribute in the instance instead of the class (by using <code>self.attribute = value</code> as Lennart said).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you could achieve introspection also if for each there was a function to create the default argument instead of a value. the inspect module will just call that function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SilentGhost:  I'm talking about if the behaviour was changed to recreate it - creating it once is the current behaviour, and why the mutable default problem exists.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@yairchu: That assumes the construction is safe to so (ie has no side effects).  Introspecting the args shouldn't <i>do</i> anything, but evaluating arbitrary code could well end up having an effect.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A different language design often just means writing things differently.  Your first example could easily be written as: _expensive = expensive(); def foo(arg=_expensive), if you specifically <i>don't</i> want it reevaluated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Glenn - that's what I was referring to with "cache the variable externally" - it is a bit more verbose, and you end up with extra variables in your namespace though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It took me a year to find this behavior is messing up my code on production, ended up removing a complete feature until I bumped into this design flaw by chance.  I'm using Django.  Since the staging environment did not have many requests, this bug never had any impact on QA.  When we went live and received many simultaneous requests - some utility functions started overwriting each other's parameters!  Making security holes, bugs and what not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@oriadam, no offense, but I wonder how you learned Python without running into this before.  I am just learning Python now and this possible pitfall is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mentioned in the official Python tutorial</a> right alongside the first mention of default arguments.  (As mentioned in point 4 of this answer.)  I suppose the moral is—rather unsympathetically—to read the <b>official docs</b> of the language you use to create production software.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, it would be surprising (to me) if a function of unknown complexity was called in addition to the function call I am making.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is <code>id(...)</code> needed for that last verification, or would the <code>is</code> operator answer the same question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@das-g <code>is</code> would do just fine, I just used <code>id(val)</code> because I think it might be more intuitive.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">(Actually, <b>add</b> is a bad example, but integers being immutable still is my main point.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, that wasn't good example</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Realized it to my chagrin after checking to see that, with b set to [], b.__add__([1]) returns [1] but also leaves b still [] even though lists are mutable.  My bad.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ANon: there is <code>__iadd__</code>, but it doesn't work with int. Of course. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It wouldn't need to be a closure - a better way to think of it would simply to make the bytecode creating defaults the first line of code - after all you're compiling the body at that point anyway - there's no real difference between code in the arguments and code in the body.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">True, but it would still slow Python down, and it would actually be quite surprising, unless you do the same for class definitions, which would make it stupidly slow as you would have to re-run the whole class definition each time you instantiate a class.  As mentioned, the fix would be more surprising than the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Agreed with Lennart.  As Guido is fond of saying, for every language feature or standard library, there's <i>someone</i> out there using it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Changing it now would be insanity--we're just exploring why it is the way it is.  If it did late default evaluation to begin with, it wouldn't necessarily be surprising.  It's definitely true that such a core a difference of parsing would have sweeping, and probably many obscure, effects on the language as a whole.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I hope you're aware that Python is <i>not</i> a functional programming language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, Python is a multi-paragigm language with some functional features. ("Don't make every problem look like a nail just because you have a hammer.") Many of them are in Python best practicies. Python has an interesting <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/functional.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HOWTO Functional Programming</a> Other features are closures and currying, not mentioned here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd also add, at this late stage, that Python's assignment semantics have been designed explicitly to avoid data copying where necessary, so the creation of copies (and especially of deep copies) will affect both run-time and memory usage adversely. They should therefore be used only when necessary, but newcomers often have difficulty understanding when that is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@holdenweb I agree. A temporary copy is the most usual way and sometimes the only possible way how to protect the original mutable data from an extraneous function that modifies them potentially. Fortunately a function that unreasonably modifies data is considered a bug and therefore uncommon.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree with this answer. And I don't understand why the <code>def f( a = None )</code> construct is recommended when you really mean something else. Copying is ok, because you shouldn't mutate arguments. And when you do <code>if a is None: a = [1, 2, 3]</code>, you do copy the list anyway.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Although related, I think this is distinct behaviour (as we expect <code>append</code> to change <code>a</code> "in-place"). That a <b>default mutable is not re-instantiated on each call</b> is the "unexpected" bit... at least for me. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndyHayden if the function is <i>expected</i> to modify the argument, why would it make sense to have a default?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MarkRansom the only example I can think of is <code>cache={}</code>. However, I suspect this "least astonishment" comes up is when you <i>don't</i> expect (or want) the function you're calling to mutate the argument.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndyHayden I left my own answer here with an expansion of that sentiment. Let me know what you think. I might add your example of <code>cache={}</code> into it for completeness.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndyHayden The point of my answer is that if you are ever astonished by accidentally mutating the default value of an argument, then you have another bug, which is that your code can accidentally mutate a caller's value when the default <i>wasn't</i> used. And note that using <code>None</code> and assigning the real default if the arg is <code>None</code> <i>does not resolve that problem</i> (I consider it an anti pattern for that reason). If you fix the other bug by avoiding mutating argument values whether or not they have defaults then you'll never notice or care about this "astonishing" behavior.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how do you obtain the dissasembly?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use the dis module:  <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/dis.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/library/dis.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">How much of a difference could <code>3 LOAD_CONST    4 ((1, 2, 3))</code> make over even millions of iterations? ^0^. Maybe I'll profile and report back...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">actually this might be a bit confusing for newcomers as <code>a = a + [1]</code> overloads <code>a</code>... consider changing it to <code>b = a + [1] ; print id(b)</code> and add a line <code>a.append(2)</code>. That will make it more obvious that <code>+</code> on two lists always creates a new list (assigned to <code>b</code>), while a modified <code>a</code> can still have the same <code>id(a)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I prefer to add a decorator for memoization, and put the memoization cache onto the function object itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This example doesn't replace the more complex pattern you show, because you call <code>_make_singleton</code> at def time in the default argument example, but at call time in the global example. A true substitution would use some sort of mutable box for the default argument value, but the addition of the argument makes an opportunity to pass alternate values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is a nice solution in cases where you're using automatic documentation generation software to document the types of arguments expected by the function.  Putting a=None and then setting a to [] if a is None doesn't help a reader understand at a glance what is expected.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Better to use a docstring.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Cool idea: rebinding that name guarantees it can never be modified. I really like that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is exactly the way to do it. Python doesn't make a copy of the parameter, so it's up to you to make the copy explicitly. Once you have a copy, it's yours to modify as you please without any unexpected side effects.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">-1 Although a defensible perspective, this not an answer, <b>and</b> I disagree with it. Too many special exceptions beget their own corner cases.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So then, it is "amazingly ignorant" to say that in Python it would make more sense for a default argument of [] to remain [] every time the function is called?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And it is ignorant to consider as an unfortunate idiom setting a default argument to None, and then in the body of the body of the function setting if argument == None: argument = []? Is it ignorant to consider this idiom unfortunate as often people want what a naive newcomer would expect, that if you assign f(argument = []), argument will automatically default to a value of []?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But in Python, part of the spirit of the language is that you don't have to take too many deep dives; array.sort() works, and works  regardless of how little you understand about sorting, big-O, and constants. The beauty of Python in the array sorting mechanism, to give one of innumerable examples, is that you are not required to take a deep dive into internals. And to say it differently, the beauty of Python is that one is not ordinarily required to take a deep dive into implementation to get something that Just Works. And there is a workaround (...if argument == None: argument = []), FAIL.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As a standalone, the statement <code>x=[]</code> means "create an empty list object, and bind the name 'x' to it."  So, in <code>def f(x=[])</code>, an empty list is also created.  It doesn't always get bound to x, so instead it gets bound to the default surrogate.  Later when f() is called, the default is hauled out and bound to x.  Since it was the empty list itself that was squirreled away, that same list is the only thing available to bind to x, whether anything has been stuck inside it or not.  How could it be otherwise?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your last point is wrong. Try it and you'll see that <code>x[7]()</code> is <code>9</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"python pass elementary data type by value, i.e., make a local copy of the value to a local variable" is completely incorrect. I am astonished that someone can obviously know Python very well, yet have such horrible misunderstanding of fundamentals. :-(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Was the -1 because of the tone, or do you think what I'm saying is wrong?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"Doing something wrong" is the diagnosis. That said, I think there are times were =None pattern is useful, but generally you don't want to modify if passed a mutable in that case (2). The <code>cache={}</code> pattern is really an interview-only solution, in real code you probably want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>@lru_cache</code></a>!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AustinHenley lack of explanation what's going on?</span>
