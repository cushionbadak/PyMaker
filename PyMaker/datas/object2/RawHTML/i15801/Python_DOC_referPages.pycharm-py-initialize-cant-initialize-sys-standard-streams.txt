<p>I'm trying to use PyCharm IDE but none of my programs compile even simple Hello World. PyCharm gives this error: </p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: can't initialize sys standard streams
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python34\lib\io.py", line 72, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'ABCMeta'
Process finished with exit code 3
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not able to find the solution for it and also referred the link <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7111025/pydev-fatal-error-python32-lib-io-py-line-60-in-module">PyDev: Fatal error Python32\lib\io.py, line 60, in &lt;module&gt;</a> but there is no solution there.</p>
<p>Python 3.4 is installed on my Win 7 OS system.</p>

<p>I faced the same problem because I created a file named <code>abc.py</code>, remove that file in your project, your error will disappear.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, as you said in the comment, the problem is in the filename 'abc'. You will be able to run this file within PyCharm, if you uncheck: </p>
<ul>
<li>Add content roots to PYTHONPATH</li>
<li>Add sources roots to PYTHONPATH</li>
</ul>
<p>in the menu "Run/Debug Configurations". </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Finally found how to solve this problem in PyCharm: never use a name like <code>abc.py</code> or <code>test.py</code>.</p>
<p>Simply use another name, like <code>a.py</code> or <code>my-unique-file-name.py</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have the same problem, just change your file's name from io.py to something else, It's work!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>try this:
File-&gt;Setting-&gt;Editor-&gt;File Encodings
change the Project encoding to UTF-8</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Change your file's name from <code>io.py</code> to something else.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I solved my issue. Apparently PyCharm is not able to execute a file named <code>abc.py</code> because there is an in-built module called abc in Python. Executing <code>abc.py</code> via command line works. Check if your file is named <code>abc.py</code>, if it is, rename it to something else.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why the file name abc.py is not supported in pycharm?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you name your file abc.py you're shadowing the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">standard library's abc (abstract base class)</a>. When you do that, everything that depends on the built-in abc will get yours instead. Unless you've essentially rewritten the standard library's code, things will break.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is way beyond normal...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is what worked for me. I suspect it should be the accepted answer. There should be no magic-forbidden module names such as "abc.py".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also worth checking to make sure the 'working directory' option isn't pointing to your file or subpackage.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is just plain odd. I had to rename one of my packages its name was io and when debugging(and only then) would it not work! Afer changing to inout all worked.</span>
