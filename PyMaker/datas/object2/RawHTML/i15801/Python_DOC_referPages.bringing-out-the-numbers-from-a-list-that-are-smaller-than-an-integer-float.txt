<p>I have to make a program in Python 3.4 that let's me input numbers and names that go into a list, and then I have print out the numbers that are less than average of the sum. I've been stuck with the last part as I don't know how to print out only the numbers that are less than average of the list. 
Let's say the list is [190, 188, 185, 174, 172] and the average is 181.8, how can I get it working?</p>
<p>//edit I got the first part working with this </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>uus_list = []</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>for x in pikkused:</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>for y in kesk_list:</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>if x &lt; y:</code>
<code>uus_list.append(x))</code></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I got another problem. Is there a way to tie 2 lists together?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>num = [190, 188, 185, 174, 172]
avg = sum(num)/len(num)
[ x for x in num if x &lt; avg ]
</code></pre>
<p>here in my code <code>sum</code> function will give you sum of all element of list num. <code>len</code> will give you no of element in num. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Since this is probably a homework assignment I don't want to do it for you. But assuming you know the average already, I suggest looking into <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehensions</a> and their built in filtering abilities. Or if you're feeling functional, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">filter</a> method</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sadly you have just done someones how work for him - how will they learn if they just come here and get someone else to do it for them ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry yeaa they need to try and give what they have tried</span>
