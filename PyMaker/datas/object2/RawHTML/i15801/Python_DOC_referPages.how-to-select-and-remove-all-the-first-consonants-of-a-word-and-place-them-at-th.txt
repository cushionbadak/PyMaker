<p>I want to remove all the first consonants of a word and place them at the end of the word</p>
<p>input -&gt; <code>"step down"</code></p>
<p>output -&gt; <code>"epst ownd"</code></p>
<p>this is my code so far:</p>
<pre><code>def lang(text):
    alist=text.split() 
    vokaler="äåöaeiouÄÅÖAEIOU"
    retText=""
    for word in alist:
        nytext=""
        nytext_b=""
        n=0
        for tkn in word:
            if not tkn in vokaler:
                nytext+=tkn
                n+=1
            else:    
                for rest in word[n:]:
                    nytext_b+=rest
                    retText=nytext_b+nytext+"all"+" "

    return retText

print(lang("step down"))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to put every letter of the string to end then you can use following code:</p>
<pre><code>  a="step down"
  l=a.split()
  print l
  data1=""
  for x in l:
     data=x[1:]+x[0:1]
     data1=data1+data

     data1=data1+" "
  print data1
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>  teps ownd 
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">So? What does your code do, and what did you expect it to instead?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does it work as written?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The code as it is goes through every letter of a word. If it is a consonant it saves it to an empty variable. If it is a vowel then it runs through the rest of the word and saves it in another variable. Then i add them together into an empty third var. I dont know how to stop the loop from continuing after it has gone through the rest of the word</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then I suggest you learn more about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">control flow</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is what i get: owndall. For some reason it skips the first word</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your code does not do what you say - <code>put every letter of the string to end</code>.  Also, OP stated every <code>first consonant</code> to the end.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you see the output which I given in post</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Probably, because it is incorrect and only works for the given example and it is not solving the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">CAN YOU GIVE THE STRING WHICH IS NOT WORKING?@badc0re</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your code works great Jack! Thanks for the help! :)</span>
