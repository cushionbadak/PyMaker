<p>I don't know how to convert a matrix of <code>10x10</code> into four matrices of <code>5x5</code>, for example:</p>
<pre><code>[[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], # matrix 10x10
 [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29],
 [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39],
 [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49],
 [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59],
 [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69],
 [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
 [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29],
 [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39],
 [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]]
</code></pre>
<p>I need to convert into this:</p>
<pre><code>[[10, 11, 12, 13, 14] # 4 like this with the other numbers too
 [20, 21, 22, 23, 24] 
 [30, 31, 32, 33, 34]
 [40, 41, 42, 43, 44]
 [50, 51, 52, 53, 54]]
</code></pre>

&gt;&gt;&gt; from pprint import pprint
&gt;&gt;&gt; pprint([x[:5] for x in matrix[:5]])
[[10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
 [20, 21, 22, 23, 24],
 [30, 31, 32, 33, 34],
 [40, 41, 42, 43, 44],
 [50, 51, 52, 53, 54]]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><code>sequence[:5]</code> gets the first five items in <code>sequence</code>.  So, <code>matrix[:5]</code> gets the first five sublists in <code>matrix</code> and <code>x[:5]</code> gets the first five items in each of those sublists.  <code>pprint.pprint</code> is only used to format the output.</p>
