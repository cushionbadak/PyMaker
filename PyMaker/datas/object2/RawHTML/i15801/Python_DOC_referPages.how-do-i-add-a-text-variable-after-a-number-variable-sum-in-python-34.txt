<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>print("This program calculates information about rectangles/squares.")
length = float(input("The length is "))
width = float(input("The width is "))
unit = input("The unit of measurement is ")
print()
print("The area is ", length * width)
print("The perimeter is ", 2 * length")
</code></pre>
<p>I need to add the user input for unit to appear at the end of the measurement. For example, if the user inputs cm for the unit of measurement, I want x cm; instead of just x.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just put in another comma:</p>
<pre><code>print("The area is ", length * width, unit)
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print</code></a> function just converts each argument to a string,* and prints them on a line together with a space between each.**</p>
<p>Just like you can use that to print <code>"The area is "</code>, you can use it to print whatever's in <code>unit</code>; if that's <code>"cm"</code>, it'll print <code>The area is  42 cm</code>.</p>
<p>(Note that you probably didn't want that space at the end of <code>"The area is "</code>, because <code>print</code> is already going to add one there.)</p>
<p>In general, once you get beyond trivial cases, it's usually more readable to use string formatting. But for simple cases (while you're learning, for quick&amp;dirty scripts, for exploratory debugging, etc.), <code>print</code> with multiple arguments is usually fine.</p>
<hr/>
<p><sub>* A string converted to a string is just itself, which you can already see with <code>"The area is "</code>.</sub></p>
<p><sub>** Although you can configure the "on a line" and "with a space between" with the keyword arguments <code>end</code> and <code>sep</code>; see the linked docs.</sub></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Calculate the result before and use it with string.format. You might also want to check the perimeter formula...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ydaetskcoR: And the area formula; the area of a 3 cm x 4 cm rectangle is not 12 cm, it's 12 cm^2…</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I still get <code>NameError</code>. Cm not being defined, something like that.                                                      <code>length = float(input("The length is ")) width = float(input("The width is ")) unit = input("The unit of measurement is ") print() print("The area is ", length * width, unit) print("The perimeter is ", 2 * length + 2 * width, unit)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">note that "the area is 42 cm" is not a valid sentence...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SpontaneousCombustion: That's a different problem, so you should create a different question… but I'll bet I know what's wrong. You're trying to write Python 3 code, but you're using Python 2. In Python 2, <code>input</code> tries to evaluate the user's input as if it were Python source code; you want <code>raw_input</code> instead. Also, you don't want parentheses around your <code>print</code> arguments in Python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ch3ka: Sure it is. Well, it's missing a period, and you didn't capitalize the first letter (but the OP and I both did), and obviously <code>cm</code> is the wrong unit to use for area, but what do you think is wrong with it as a sentence?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The "it's not an area unit" thing. While syntactically correct, it just makes no sense so say (or print) such a sentence.</span>
