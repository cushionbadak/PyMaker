<p>I can't see the answer for this anywhere but I know it's a stupid question so sorry in advance!!</p>
<p>I have a list like this:</p>
<pre><code>fullList = [("a","/a/"),("b","/b/"),("c","/c/"),("d","/d/"),("e","/e/")]
</code></pre>
<p>If I have the value, lets say c then how do I get it's index for the array?</p>
<p>If I use the index method it's doesn't work:</p>
<pre><code>listIndex = fullList.index('c')
</code></pre>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Cheers and sorry if a really stupid question...</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you just need a list comprehension and use <code>in</code> operation  :</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [fullList.index(i) for i in fullList if 'c' in i]
[2]
</code></pre>
<p>If you just want to check for first index you can use this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [fullList.index(i) for i in fullList if i[0]=='c']
[2]
</code></pre>
<p>Also note that you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=enumerate#enumerate" rel="nofollow"><code>enumerate</code></a> function in your list comprehension that have more performance here , (the order of <code>index()</code> is <code>O(n)</code>) you can refuse from an extra searching !</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [i for i,j in enumerate(fullList) if j[0]=='c']
[2]

&gt;&gt;&gt; [i for i,j in enumerate(fullList) if 'c' in j]
[2]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A list's index() looks for equality on the elements of the list, so you want to provide the item that equals what you're looking for. Specifically, in this case, it would be:</p>
<pre><code>listIndex = fullList.index(('c', '/c/'))
</code></pre>
<p>If you really need to search by the first element of the tuple, you can grab just the first one of each item and do .index on that:</p>
<pre><code>listIndex = [ e[0] for e in fullList ].index('c')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do you need the index or the full value ? In the second case:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; found = dict(fullList).get('c')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print found
("c", "/c/")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">mcquaim, see my edit to my answer. It builds a list of the first parts of the tuples and matches on that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, works a treat...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for all the help everyone, sorted now!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, the edit works well too!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't know who's downvoting sensible answers, nor why...</span>
