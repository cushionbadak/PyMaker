<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have an array of basketball players that has an array for each player containing data like this:</p>
<pre><code>[[893, "Jordan, Michael", 0, "1984", "2002", "michael_jordan"],[674, "Doe, John", 0, "2009", "2014", "doe_john"]]
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to filter this array to only show players who have the year <code>"2014"</code> in their array, so I can get a list of all active players. </p>
<p>Here is the code I'm trying now:</p>
<pre><code>players =  [[893, "Jordan, Michael", 0, "1984", "2002", "michael_jordan"],[674, "Doe, John", 0, "2009", "2014", "doe_john"]]
active = set('2014')
for player in players:
     if players &amp; set(active):
          print active
</code></pre>
<p>And the error in the console is:</p>
<pre><code>    Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &amp;: 'list' and 'set'
</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone help me out with this? I would really appreciate it!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>active</code> is a set but <code>player</code> is a list.  Using <code>&amp;</code> only works with two set objects, not a list and a set.</p>
<p>However, you should not be using sets for this in the first place because you only want to see if a string is inside a list.  For that, you should use a simple <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#in" rel="nofollow"><code>in</code> membership test</a> :</p>
<pre><code>players =  [[893, "Jordan, Michael", 0, "1984", "2002", "michael_jordan"],[674, "Doe, John", 0, "2009", "2014", "doe_john"]]
active = '2014'
for player in players:
     if active in player:
          print active
</code></pre>
<p><code>active in player</code> will return <code>True</code> if <code>'2014'</code> is in the list <code>player</code>.  Below is a demonstration:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; active = '2014'
&gt;&gt;&gt; player = [893, "Jordan, Michael", 0, "1984", "2002", "michael_jordan"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; active in player
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; player = [674, "Doe, John", 0, "2009", "2014", "doe_john"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; active in player
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
