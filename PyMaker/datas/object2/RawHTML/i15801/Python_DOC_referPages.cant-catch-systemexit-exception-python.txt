<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to catch a <code>SystemExit</code> exception in the following fashion:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    raise SystemExit
except Exception as exception:
    print "success"
</code></pre>
<p>But, it doesn't work.</p>
<p>It does work however when I change my code like that:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    raise SystemExit
except:
    print "success"
</code></pre>
<p>As far as I am aware, <code>except Exception as exception</code> should catch any exception. This is how it is described <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4992124">here</a> as well. Why isn't that working for me here?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SystemExit" rel="noreferrer">documented</a>, SystemExit does not inherit from Exception.  You would have to use <code>except BaseException</code>.</p>
<p>However, this is for a reason:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exception inherits from BaseException instead of StandardError or Exception so that it is not accidentally caught by code that catches Exception.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is unusual to want to handle "real" exceptions in the same way you want to handle SystemExit.  You might be better off catching SystemExit explicitly with <code>except SystemExit</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Perfect. Thanks! It is very well illustrated in the documentation Exception hierarchy: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy</a></span>
