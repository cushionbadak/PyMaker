<p>So I've been using ystockquote quite successfully, however I've ran into a small problem.</p>
<p>When I pull historic data for any stock it produces a dictionary with the correct information, however the order of the dictionary dates are wrong?</p>
<p>Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>import ystockquote
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

ticker = "YHOO"
stock_exchange = ystockquote.get_stock_exchange(ticker)
change = ystockquote.get_change(ticker)
price = ystockquote.get_price(ticker)
market_cap = ystockquote.get_market_cap(ticker)
_52_week_high = ystockquote.get_52_week_high(ticker)
_52_week_low = ystockquote.get_52_week_low(ticker)
avg_volume = ystockquote.get_avg_daily_volume(ticker)
volume = ystockquote.get_volume(ticker)


print (ticker + " (" + change + ") ")
print (stock_exchange.strip('"'))
print ("Share Price: " + price)
print ("Market Cap: " + market_cap)
print ("52 Week High/Low: " + _52_week_high + "/" + _52_week_low)
print ("Trading Volume: " + volume)
print ("Average Trading Volume(3m): " + avg_volume)

historic_prices = ystockquote.get_historical_prices(ticker, '2014-10-01', '2014-10-15')

for x in historic_prices:
    print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>and this is the results it produces </p>
<pre><code>YHOO (+0.20) 
NasdaqNM
Share Price: 45.63
Market Cap: 44.672B
52 Week High/Low: 46.15/32.06
Trading Volume: 16209593
Average Trading Volume(3m): 34564400
2014-10-01
2014-10-14
2014-10-02
2014-10-13
2014-10-10
2014-10-09
2014-10-08
2014-10-15
2014-10-03
2014-10-07
2014-10-06
</code></pre>
<p>as you can see the dates from the historic prices dictionary are not in the right order? I understand the gaps are to account for the weekends but the dates that are retrieved are in the wrong order? What am I doing wrong? I've seen plenty of other people on the internet use it the same way and have the dates in the right order!</p>
<p>I'm using Python 3.4!</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Ordering in a dictionary is not guaranteed. </p>

<p>Performing list(d.keys()) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in arbitrary order (if you want it sorted, just use sorted(d.keys()) instead).</p>

<p>From the sorted keys you can display the rest of the entry as well.</p>
