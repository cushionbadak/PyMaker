<p>I came across this issue that I don't have sudo access to install any software on redhat servers(python is installed). My python script depends a lot libraries. How could I use this libraries from the source code?</p>

<p>If the python 3.3 or higher can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments" rel="nofollow">venv</a>, if not try to see if you have <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/virtualenv.html#usage" rel="nofollow">virtualenv</a> </p>

<p>You do not need root access to install libraries for Python.</p>
<p>Ideally you would use virtual environments, installing with <code>pip</code>, to isolate the different libraries needed by different applications. However, to achieve what you want the simplest solution is to create a directory in which you place the required libraries, then add that directory to the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>When Python starts, it adds the directories from <code>$PYTHONPATH</code> to the <code>sys.path</code> list, so they are searched when the interpreter looks for libraries. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path" rel="nofollow">this manual page</a> for more details of how libraries are loaded.</p>

<p><code>virtualenv</code> has already been mentionned a few times and it's really the best way so far to manage per-project dependencies - but in your case it won't solve non-python system packages dependencies (GCC for non-pure python packages, and system libs and headers).</p>
