<p>I found that some libs depend python2 and some libs work on python3. 
I know there is a lib that can port code from python 2 to python 3. I am not sure if it has more easy way to make these libs work together. 
How can I use these libs? Thanks a lot</p>
<p>EDIT: to make the question more specific. 
I want to write python script to copy changelist from perforce and commit them into git. So I want to use both <a href="https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython" rel="nofollow">GitPython</a> and P4Python. <a href="https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython" rel="nofollow">GitPython</a> can only work on python 2 (although evaluate python 3.3 compatibility is its current goal) while P4Python can only work on python 3. </p>
<p>How can I make this work? </p>

<p>There are many tools and tricks to port python 2.x to python 3.x and to write code compatible with both version.</p>
<p>You will find a dedicated <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html" rel="nofollow">Howto</a> on that subject in Python 3 documentation. Some referenced tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html" rel="nofollow">2to3</a>: to convert from Python2 to Python3</li>
<li>caniusepython3 (<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/caniusepython3" rel="nofollow">command-line tool</a>, <a href="https://caniusepython3.com/" rel="nofollow">web app</a>: to control dependencies</li>
<li><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six" rel="nofollow">six</a>: low level project to help writing 2-3 compatible code</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/python-modernize" rel="nofollow">modernize</a>: to help porting existing code to six</li>
</ul>
<p>And last but not least <code>__future__</code> is a must in that context, at least the famous:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
</code></pre>
<p>that allows using the <code>print()</code> function from Python3 under Python2</p>
<p>But if you want to do serious things, read the whole Howto.</p>

<p><em>Most</em> python2.x projects can be made to work with python3 using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html" rel="nofollow">2to3</a> tool which typically comes bundled with your python3.x installation.</p>
<p>As noted in the comments, if you're interested in <em>developing</em> code that can be used (out of the box) on both python2.x and python3.x, the third party package <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six" rel="nofollow"><code>six</code></a> contains lots of useful utilities for writing backward and forward compatible code.  It doesn't help you run somebody else's code though :-).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks a lot @tripleee</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tripleee with six, I can write code that can run on python 2 and 3. But how can I make two dependence libs (one needs python2, the other needs python3) work together?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need my code work with gitdb which needs python2 and python-perforce which needs python3.</span>
