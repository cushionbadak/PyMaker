<p>It keep coming up with <code>EOL while scanning string literal</code> but what does this mean?</p>
<p>This is the section it keeps calling an error:</p>
<pre><code>if health2 &lt;= 3:

<p>It means that your string literal is malformed.  You need to use triple quotes for a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow">multi-line string</a>:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like a fun project, OP. If you end up having a lot of these types of prints, it might be worth you time trying to save these long string messages in .txt or .xml files. This way you don't have text clogging up your code, and you wont have to recompile if you want to change what is said to the user.</span>
