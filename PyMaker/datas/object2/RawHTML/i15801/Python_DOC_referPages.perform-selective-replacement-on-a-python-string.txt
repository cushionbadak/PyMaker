<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i spent last night trying to deal with strings in Python3.
It would be very helpful from your part if you could help me to resolve this problem.</p>
<p>So, suppose that i've a string like this : </p>
<pre><code>a = "√22+34-4+√(2+3)/5+√3"
</code></pre>
<p>NB: the string a is a user input and may change every time.</p>
<p>i want to manage the string to be like this : </p>
<pre><code>a = "√(22)+34-4+√(2+3)/5+√(3)"
</code></pre>
<p>then i can replace "√" by "sqrt" using <code>a.replace("√","sqrt").</code></p>
<p>Any suggestions ? And sorry for my bad english :) 
Thanks</p>

<p>You could try <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub" rel="nofollow"><code>re.sub()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "√22+34-4+√(2+3)/5+√3"
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r'√(\d+)', r'√(\1)', a)  # \1 is whatever was captured by (\d+)
'√(22)+34-4+√(2+3)/5+√(3)'
</code></pre>
<p>But if you need anything more sophisticated, you'll probably have to write a parser of some sort.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What you're trying to match is something like "√ followed by a string of digits, but not √ followed by an expression in parentheses", right? That's pretty hard to write in terms of pure <code>str</code> methods, but relatively easy to write in terms of regular expressions, or <code>pyparsing</code>, or almost anything else.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If your question is really about how to modify a python string: you can't (at least not "in place"). You can create new strings based on the previous one, though. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9189172/python-string-replace">stackoverflow.com/questions/9189172/python-string-replace</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnet &amp; Ricardo Cárdenes : What i want to do is to catch digits that follow √ and stopps when there is "+" or "-" or "*" or "/" or "(" or ")" .   The answer of arshaji is good enough for my problem. I may use regular expression "re".  Thanks a lot for your answers :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@nexus66 Note that <code>re.sub(...,...,a)</code> DOES NOT modify your <code>a</code> string, it creates a new string instead!  If you want to use the new string (the one with parentheses) <i>you have to assign the new string to a variable</i>.  A common pattern is simply <code>a=re.sub(...,...,a)</code> in which you throw away the old string to replace it with the new one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@arshajii : Yes ! That's what i'm looking for. I remember that i found the fonction re in my Python3 courses. i'll try to understand your answer. Thanks a lot for your quick answer :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@gboffi : Yes ! The return of this function is a string. I put it inside my PyGObject code and it work well !  I'm trying to create a calculator using Python3 and Gtk3+.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@nexus66 What exactly are you trying to match with <code>\d.+</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@nexus66 Try using <code>√(\d*\.?\d+)</code> as the regular expression.</span>
