<p>I have tried a few different thing here and I'm just at a lost.  Any help would be appreciated, here is my code.</p>
<pre><code>numL = [];
for count in range (6):
    num = input("Enter Numbers ");
    if int(num) &lt;= -999:
        print("Sentinel value was entered")
print(int(num) &gt; sum(int(num))/ float(len(int(num))))
</code></pre>

<p>In python 3.4 you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html#statistics.mean" rel="nofollow">statistics.mean</a> and a list comp:</p>
<pre><code>from statistics import  mean

l = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
print([x for x in l if x &gt; mean(l)])
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
</code></pre>
<p>Not sure what your if statement is doing but you could just create a list if nums when you get the input:</p>
<pre><code>nums = [int(input("Enter Numbers ")) for _ in range(6)]
print([x for x in nums if x &gt; mean(nums)])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use a list comprehension to easily accomplish this:</p>
<pre><code>[a for a in your_list if a &gt; sum(your_list) / len(your_list)]
</code></pre>
<p>If you're not familiar with list comprehensions, this basically says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>for every element <code>a</code> in <code>your_list</code>, add <code>a</code> to a new list if it's greater than the sum of the list divided by its length (i.e. its mean). Return the new list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, for the list <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</code>, this returns <code>[6, 7, 8, 9]</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I am using 3.4, but I tried implementing this into my code and I get can't convert type 'str' to numerator/denominator, so I tried converting it to an int, but no luck.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@underspych, try the code I just added, I am not fully sure what you if should be doing or the later code as you have ints not a list so len() etc.. makes no sense</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much that seemed to work :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no worries, you're welcome</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey the only problem I'm having now was in my original code I had  if int(num) &lt;= -999:         print("Sentinel value was entered")  now that does not work at all I tried converting the list into an int but no luck with that.</span>
