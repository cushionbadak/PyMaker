<p>I want to subtract numbers that are in string.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>number_str = input("number:")
</code></pre>
<p>When I run the program, I would input <code>1000 300</code>, divided by space.
Then I would divide number_str into first_str and second_str, make them into integers and do the subtraction. 
I don't know how to divide it in 2 separate strings. </p>

<pre><code>line = input('number:')
words = line.split()
firstNumber = int(words[0])
secondNumber = int(words[1])
result = firstNumber - secondNumber

<span class="comment-copy">What have you thought about or tried so far?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which part do you not know how to do? How to separate a string divided by space? How to convert strings into numbers? How to subtract numbers?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You may want to look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods" rel="nofollow noreferrer">methods of <code>str</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built-in functions</a> in the docs, because there are functions for all of these steps.

<span class="comment-copy">from my understanding I need to divide string in 2 different strings and subtract, them. I know how to subtract, I would just change strings into integers. I guess I can't figure out how to divide the string</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Artem: Then edit the question show the code you <i>can</i> write, with a gap for the part you can't. Pretend you had some magic way to get from <code>number_str</code> to <code>first_number_str</code> and <code>second_number_str</code> (or whatever else you think you might want) and write the rest of the code from there, with a <code># how do I get first_number_str and second_number_str from number_str?</code> comment in between. That would make a reasonable question. This version just looks like you're asking us to do all your work for you, which is probably why you have 4 downvotes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you write the middle two lines to generate an unpredictable-until-runtime list of numbers instead of just two, that last line is going to be very hard for a novice to write.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. The line.split was the thing I was looking for.</span>
