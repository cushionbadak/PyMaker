<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to return elements of words that have length size.
Words is a list and size is a positive integer here.
The result should be like this.</p>
<pre><code>by_size(['a','bb','ccc','dd'],2] returns ['bb','dd']


def by_size(words,size)
    for word in words:
        if len(word)==size:
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure how to continue from this part. Any suggestion would be a great help.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would use a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>def by_size(words, size):
    return [word for word in words if len(word) == size]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>return filter(lambda x: len(x)==size, words)
</code></pre>
<p>for more info about the function, please see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">filter()</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def by_size(words,size):
    result = []
    for word in words:
        if len(word)==size:
            result.append(word)
    return result
</code></pre>
<p>Now call the function like below</p>
<pre><code>desired_result = by_size(['a','bb','ccc','dd'],2)
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>desired_result</code> will be <code>['bb', 'dd']</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do you mean this:</p>
<pre><code>In [1]: words = ['a', 'bb', 'ccc', 'dd']

In [2]: result = [item for item in words if len(item)==2]

In [3]: result
Out[3]: ['bb', 'dd']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming you want to use them later then returning them as a list is a good idea. Or just print them to terminal. It really depends on what you are aiming for. You can just go list (or whatever the variable name is).append within the if statement to do this.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">+1, list comprehensions are preferred to using sorted, filter, map and simple for loops.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think this is nice. If I want to enforce my precondition which is,"words is a list of strings. size is a positive int", is there anything I need to modify?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes , you can enforce your precondition with the modification like:         <b>if size&gt;-1 and if isinstance(word, str):</b></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The OP states what he's after in his question - he wants to return a list.</span>
