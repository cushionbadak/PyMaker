<p>I have a python program running a resource-intensive simulation. I would like to have it capture a keypress (preferably any, but just space would work too) and report status when it does.</p>
<p>How should I go about doing this?</p>

<p>You question doesn't provide too much details, so it's hard to give a detailed answer, but in general, I would use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#module-signal" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>signal</code></a> module to print the status.</p>
<p>BSD has <code>SIGINFO</code> (bound to <code>^T</code>) for exactly this purpose; Linux &amp; Windows unfortunately don't implement this, so it's not very portable.<br/>
On Linux, but you can use <code>SIGUSR1</code>, you can't send this from the keyboard, but you can use <code>kill</code>.</p>
<p>You could also use <code>SIGINT</code> (<code>^C</code>) to print the status. This has the side-effect of no longer being able to quit the program with ^C, though.</p>
