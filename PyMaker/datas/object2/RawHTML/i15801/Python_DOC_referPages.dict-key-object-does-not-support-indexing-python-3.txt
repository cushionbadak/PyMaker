<p>I am getting an error saying "dict_key object does not support indexing" at:</p>
<pre><code>return len(G[G.keys()[0]])
</code></pre>
<p>I realised it used to work in python 2.7.x but not in python 3.How should i change this statement to make it work in python 3.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python 2.x, <code>G.keys()</code> returns a list, but Python 3.x returns a <code>dict_keys</code> object instead. The solution is to wrap <code>G.keys()</code> with call to <code>list()</code>, to convert it into the correct type:</p>
<pre><code>return len(G[list(G.keys())[0]])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python 3, the objects returned by <code>keys</code>, <code>values</code>, and <code>items</code> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict-views" rel="nofollow">dictionary view objects</a>, which don't support indexing. </p>
<p>Try, instead:</p>
<pre><code>len(next(iter(G.values())))
</code></pre>
<p>This gets the dictionary view object for the dictionary's values, gets its iterator, grabs the first item from the iterator (the first value in the dictionary), and returns its length.</p>
<p>Unlike other methods that create a new <code>list</code> of the keys or values, it should take approximately the same amount of time no matter the size of the dictionary.</p>
<p>It works in both Python 2 and Python 3 (though to be efficient you'd need to use <code>itervalues</code> or <code>viewvalues</code> on Python 2).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">When i try this statement,I am getting "the list out of index" error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This happens if <code>G</code> is empty, but the same would happen on Python 2.x as far as I'm aware.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you have Python 2.x code that you need to run with 3.x, you may want to take a look at the command <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>2to3</code></a>: it shows you what needs to be changed and how in order for the code to be Python 3.x compatible. The command should have been installed with your Python distribution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am getting an error called "Stop Iteration"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3258267 That'll happen if <code>G</code> is empty. If you want to default to <code>0</code>, you can use <code>len(next(iter(dct.values()), []))</code></span>
