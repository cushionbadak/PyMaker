<p>Questions: How do you represent a file in python as an object, entirely in memory, making no calls to the hard drive?</p>
<hr/>
<p>Info: </p>
<p>I'm working on a project that has files distributed across many computers at once, these files are all stored in a SQLite3 database with identifiers so that the files can be keep in sync and I only have to have 1 file to deal with on the computers rather than many. </p>
<p>My problem is that the "open" command requires a path on the hard drive. well that path doesn't exist. I still need to be able to interact with these file objects though. What I'm looking for is a way to interact with these files as if they were on the hard drive, but they are only in memory, probably as a byte string. so kind like if i were to go: </p>
<pre><code>file = open(&lt;location in memory&gt;,'r')
</code></pre>
<p>I've tried searching for this, but all search results just point to streaming files from the hard drive. so just to make this clear, I am no streaming from the hard drive, and that is not an option. If I have to do that, I'll rework my system for that. but right now that is an extra pointless step.</p>

<p>Take a look at the StringIO (and cStringIO) module: <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stringio.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://docs.python.org/library/stringio.html</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Exactly! Perfect. Thank you.</span>
