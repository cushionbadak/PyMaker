<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm parsing text from file with Python. I have to replace all newlines (\n) with <br/> cause this text will build html-content. For example, here is some line from file:</p>
<pre><code>'title\n'
</code></pre>
<p>Now I do:</p>
<pre><code>thatLine.replace('\n', '&lt;br /&gt;')
print thatLine
</code></pre>
<p>And I still see the text with newline after it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just for kicks, you could also do</p>
<pre><code>mytext = "&lt;br /&gt;".join(mytext.split("\n"))
</code></pre>
<p>to replace all newlines in a string with <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>thatLine = thatLine.replace('\n', '&lt;br /&gt;')</code></p>
<p>str.replace() returns a copy of the string, it doesn't modify the string you pass in.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>thatLine = thatLine.replace('\n', '&lt;br /&gt;')
</code></pre>
<p>Strings in Python are immutable.
You might need to recreate it with the assignment operator.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To handle many newline delimiters, including character combinations like <code>\r\n</code>, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines" rel="noreferrer">splitlines</a> (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/43641376/3780389">this related post</a>) use the following:</p>
<pre><code>'&lt;br /&gt;'.join(thatLine.splitlines())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For some reason using python3 I had to escape the "\"-sign </p>
<pre><code>somestring.replace('\\n', '')
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps someone else!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could also have problems if the string has <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> or <code>&amp;</code> chars in it, etc. Pass it to <code>cgi.escape()</code> to deal with those. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for accepting this, but please accept @Falmarri's answer instead. It's much more Pythonic. This here is more of a funny, backwards way of doing it. Not really recommended...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't know about @Falmarri's answer being "more Pythonic", but it's more efficient and probably faster.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@martineau: I meant this in the sense of "There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.". And I'm pretty sure that mine isn't the one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This answer seems better than the accepted one.</span>
