<p>For every client connecting to my server I spawn a new thread, like this:</p>
<pre><code># Create a new client
c = Client(self.server.accept(), globQueue[globQueueIndex], globQueueIndex, serverQueue )

# Start it
c.start()

# And thread it
self.threads.append(c)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I know I can close <em>all</em> the threads using this code:</p>
<pre><code>    # Loop through all the threads and close (join) them
    for c in self.threads:
        c.join()
</code></pre>
<p>But how can I close the thread from <em>within</em> that thread?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you start a thread, it begins executing a function you give it (if you're extending <code>threading.Thread</code>, the function will be <code>run()</code>). To end the thread, just return from that function.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a>, you can also call <code>thread.exit()</code>, which will throw an exception that will end the thread silently.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A little late, but I use a <code>_is_running</code> variable to tell the thread when I want to close. It's easy to use, just implement a stop() inside your thread class.</p>
<pre><code>def stop(self):
  self._is_running = False
</code></pre>
<p>And in <code>run()</code> just loop on <code>while(self._is_running)</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>How about <code>sys.exit()</code> from the module <code>sys</code>. </p>
<p>If <code>sys.exit()</code> is executed from within a thread it will close that thread only.</p>
<p>This answer here talks about that: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/905189/why-does-sys-exit-not-exit-when-called-inside-a-thread-in-python">Why does sys.exit() not exit when called inside a thread in Python?</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want force stop your thread:
<code>thread._Thread_stop()</code>
For me works very good.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>.join()</code> does not close a thread, everything it does is <i>waiting</i> (by blocking the calling thread) for the joined thread to terminate itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thread.exit() only works with the thread object, but not with threading.Thread class object.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To improve your answer, you should include <i>when</i> it is a better alternative than the others listed here, along with a link to some documentation to support it.</span>
