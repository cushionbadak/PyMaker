<p>I have an excel which looks like something like this</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/RkYLy.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">xls example</a></p>
<p>With my script I would like to find the row where is "222" located and update this line. I write a script which can find that kind of row but only that case if the cell contains text.</p>
<p>The script:</p>
<pre><code>from openpyxl import load_workbook
issue = "222"
path = "\\.xlsx"

wb = load_workbook(path)

ws = wb.worksheets[0]
for row in ws.iter_rows():
   for cell in row:
       if cell.value == issue:
           print (cell.coordinate)
</code></pre>
<p>Outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the cell contain numbers the result is nothing. There is no error and nothing </li>
<li>If the cell contains text then the script print out the
cell number (B3)</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem in my case that the cells are only contains numbers. I already searched on the web but didn't find any solution why the script don't find number in my xls.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Problem looks to be line 2: <code>issue = "222"</code>. You defined issue as a string containing the numbers 222. Instead just change that to <code>issue = 222</code> and it should work as expected.</p>
