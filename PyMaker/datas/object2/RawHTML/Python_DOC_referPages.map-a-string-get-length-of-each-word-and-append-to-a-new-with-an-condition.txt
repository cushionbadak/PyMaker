<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to add any word that has a length greater than 5 characters, but I don't know how to add the words to it.</p>
<pre><code>s = 'This sentence is a string'
l = list(map(len, s.split()))
l.sort()
w=[]
for i in l:
    if (i &gt;= 5):
        w.append(i)
        print(w)

output [6]
             [6, 8]
</code></pre>
<p>I can get the size of each word in the sentence, but linking the length to the word itself has been hard as it is between string and integers. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could simply use a list-comprehension to do that:</p>
<pre><code>s = 'This sentence is a string'
words = [w for w in s.split() if len(w) &gt; 5]
print(words) # ==&gt; ['sentence', 'string']
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, a <code>filter</code> with a <code>lambda</code> could be used as well:</p>
<pre><code>s = 'This sentence is a string'
words = list(filter(lambda w: len(w) &gt; 5, s.split()))
print(words) # ==&gt; ['sentence', 'string']
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I actually like the list-comprehension, but it was an exercised I got stuck with as I am immigrating from java to python. Thanks a lot for your help Mr Geek</span>
