<p>Say I have this "running" python file located in:</p>
<p>C:\folder\subfolder_first\running.py</p>
<p>And I have a "helper" python file located in:
C:\folder\subfolder_second\helper.py</p>
<p>I am using Pycharm and I want to run some of the functions/methods of the helper file in the running file. How do I do it?</p>
<pre><code>from folder.subfolder_second import helper
</code></pre>
<p>I tried the above line, but it gives me the error message:
ImportError: No module named blah blah blah...</p>

<p><strong>For Python 3 only</strong></p>
<p>In order to get this to work youll need a file tree like this:</p>
<pre><code>- folder
    __init__.py
    - subfolder_first
        running.py
        __init__.py
    - subfolder_second
        helper.py
        __init__.py
</code></pre>
<p>And then you would run <code>helper</code> from <code>running.py</code> like this: </p>
<pre><code>from ..subfoler_second import helper
</code></pre>
<p>However, I would suggest structuring it like this instead:</p>
<pre><code>- folder
    running.py
    - helpers
        my_helper.py
        __init__.py
</code></pre>
<p>Then import <code>my_helper</code> from <code>running.py</code> like:</p>
<pre><code>from helpers import my_helper
</code></pre>
<p>The second way is much much better. Just do it like that.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Look at that duplicate. There is a link in there to the tutorial about Packages. Here it is too: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ultimately, you need to pretty much place an <code>__init__.py</code> in the folder you want to make discoverable as a package to be able to import it. The material I provided will explain this well.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@anon That's a completely different problem. That is misleading for this issue.</span>
