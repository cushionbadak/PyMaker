<p>My assignment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a short Python function, minmax(data), that takes a sequence
  of one or more numbers, and returns the smallest and largest numbers,
  in the form of a tuple of length two. Do not use the built-in
  functions min or max in implementing your solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code>def minmax():
    data = input("Enter a list of any input &gt; ")
    max, min = data[0]
    for x in data:
        if x &gt; max:
            max = x
        elif x &lt; min:
            min = x
    print (max, min)
minmax()
</code></pre>
<p>This gives me <code>ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)</code>.
How do I fix this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You've used the wrong syntax.  I believe that what you're trying to do is to initialize both <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> to the first element of the list.  The assignment you used is for multiple assignment -- with two variables on the left, you must have two values on the right.</p>
<p>However you want the user to enter the input is fine; simply <code>split</code> the input on the delimiter you choose, and then use that for <code>split</code>.</p>
<p>Also, remember to convert the values from string to int (left as an exercise for the student).</p>
<p>The important syntax for the error you gave is</p>
<pre><code>min = max = data[0]
</code></pre>
<p><em>Now</em> you can continue with your loop.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are bugs in your code:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should define your list format. Such as input numbers are separated by ",","" etc.</li>
<li>when you assign <code>data[0]</code> to <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>, you have to put <code>=</code> between <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please make changes in your code as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>data =[int(x) for x in input().split(",")]
max = min = data[0]
</code></pre>
<p>Please provide the <code>input</code> list as <code>number1</code>, <code>number2</code>, <code>number3</code> etc.</p>
<p>This will work correctly.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>data</code> is a tuple that holds your input items in the form (1, 2). You are doing <code>data[0]</code> which means you are getting the first item from <code>data</code> tuple, which is just one item, not two. Then with the command <code>max, min = data[0]</code> you are telling python to extract two items from one item <code>data[0]</code>.</p>
<p>Instead use:</p>
<pre><code>max, min = data
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have not converted the input into a list, and you have defined min and max in a wrong way. </p>
<p>Do this to convert inputs into list: </p>
<pre><code>data.split(" ") #if every number is separated by space
</code></pre>
<p>And for min and max, you're assigning two value by saying </p>
<pre><code>min, max= data[0]
</code></pre>
<p>do it like this:</p>
<pre><code>min=max=data[0]
</code></pre>
<p>You can cheat on this program in a way, if only condition is not using min and max function. You're sorting the list in a manner. However you can also do this:</p>
<pre><code>def minmax():
    data = input("Enter a list of any input &gt; ")
    myList= data.split(" ")
    myList.sort()
    print(myList[0], "is minimum and", myList[-1],"is max")
minmax()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">you probably need to do <code>input('').split()</code> if the user is entering data like <code>1 2 4 5 10 33</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@depperm how should the user input the data so the error doesn't happen</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ast.literal_eval</code> is usually a good way to parse the input</a> (so entering <code>12, 25, 39, 1, 3, -2, 102, -5</code> produces a <code>tuple</code> of <code>int</code>s). As is, the OP's code is computing the min and max character from a string, not parsing the string to a useful "list" of values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShadowRanger: that's why I recommended convert to <code>int</code>.  Others have already covered the input problem, so I decided not to belabour the issue.</span>
