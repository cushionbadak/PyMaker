<p>I am just a beginner programmer as of right now, and I am trying to create a username/password program. Here is my code below:</p>
<pre><code>username = 'Polly1220'

password = 'Bob'

userInput = input("What is your username?\n")

if userInput == username:
    a=input("Password?\n")   
    if a == password:
        print("Welcome!")
    else:
        print("That is the wrong password.")
else:
    print("That is the wrong username.")
</code></pre>
<p>Whenever I run my program and input the correct password as shown, it always says that the password is incorrect. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to assign the second input statement to userInput:</p>
<pre><code>if userInput == username:
    userInput = input("Password?\n")   
    if userInput == password:
       print("Welcome!")
    else:
       print("That is the wrong password.")
else:
    print("That is the wrong username.")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You forget asign the variable:</p>
<pre><code>if userInput == username
   userinput = input("Password?\n")   
    if userInput == password:
        print("Welcome!")
    else:
        print("That is the wrong password.")
else:
    print("That is the wrong username.")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you missing a colon after the first if statement?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You never assign the password input to anything</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to set <code>userInput = input("Password?\n")</code> (damn @Eugene you beat me to it)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PollytheProgrammer Also, take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html#getpass.getpass" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>getpass.getpass</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try printing <code>userInput</code> to make sure it's what you think it is</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did. Fixed now.</span>
