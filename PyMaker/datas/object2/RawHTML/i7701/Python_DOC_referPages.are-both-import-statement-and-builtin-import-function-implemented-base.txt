<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of the <code>importlib</code> package is two-fold. </p>
<p>One is to provide
  <strong>the</strong> implementation of <strong>the <code>import</code> statement</strong> (and thus, by extension,
  <strong><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#__import__" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>__import__()</code> function</a></strong>) in Python source code. This provides an
  implementation of <code>import</code> which is portable to any Python interpreter.
  This also provides an implementation which is easier to comprehend
  than one implemented in a programming language other than Python.</p>
<p>Two, the components to implement <code>import</code> are exposed in this package,
  making it easier for users to create their own custom objects (known
  generically as an importer) to participate in the import process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does it mean that both the <code>import</code> statement and <code>builtin.__import__()</code> function are by default implemented based on <code>importlib.__import()</code> function?</p>
<p>But <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44655619/156458">https://stackoverflow.com/a/44655619/156458</a> implies that
<code>builtins.__import__</code> is not implemented based on <code>importlib.__import__</code> by default.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#__import__" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#<strong>import</strong></a> says that 
<code>buitlins.__import__</code> function is invoked by the <code>import</code> statement. so if <code>builtins.__import__</code> is not implemented based on <code>importlib.__import__</code> by default, the <code>import</code> statement is not implemented based on <code>importlib.__import__</code> by default either.</p>
</div>

<p>No, the actual import code is a <em>port</em> of the Python code. See the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.6.1/Python/import.c#L1487-L1671" rel="nofollow noreferrer">implementation of the <code>PyImport_ImportModuleLevelObject()</code> function</a> (which <code>builtins.__import__</code> is basically a light Python-&gt;C wrapper for), which contains the comment:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>/* The below code is importlib.__import__() &amp; _gcd_import(), ported to C
   for added performance. */
</code></pre>
<p>So for <em>performance reasons</em>, <code>import</code> uses C-optimised code, not the Python implementation of <code>importlib</code>. The two implementations are kept in sync, however, if you were to create a pull request touching one, the Python core developers will ask you to update the other too before accepting your changes.</p>
<p>Your use of emphasis leads me to believe you are misreading the documentation; <code>importlib</code> is not <strong>the</strong> implementation of the import statement. This is <em>the implementation of the import statement</em> <strong>in Python source code</strong>, in contrast to <em>the implementation of the import statement</em> <strong>in C code</strong>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. What does "One is to provide the implementation of the import statement (and thus, by extension, the __import__() function) in Python source code " mean about the relation between the three?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tim: Python code is understood by more people; by providing a Python implementation more people can try to understand how this all works and, perhaps, provide improvement suggestions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see, thanks. Is it correct that <code>buitlins.__import__</code> attribute is binded to <code>buitlins.__import__</code> function by default, and can be rebinded to <code>importlib.__import</code> function or any custom function by <code>buitlins.__import__=&lt;anyFunction&gt;</code>? <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/44656019/156458">So are <code>buitlins.__import__` attribute and </code>buitlins.__import__` function two distinct things defined in the module <code>builtins</code>?</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tim: yes, you can do <code>builtins.__import__ = importlib.__import__</code>, letting you test the Python implementation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is the <code>import</code> statement implemented based on <code>builtins.__import__</code> function or <code>builtins.__import__</code> attribute? I am asking this, because if it is implemented based on the attribute, and when I rebind <code>builtins.__import__</code> attribute to a function different from <code>builtins.__import__</code> function, the <code>import</code> statement will not be implemented based on <code>builtins.__import__</code> function but on the different function I rebind to <code>builtins.__import__</code> attribute, correct?</span>
