<p>I am trying to make a program in Python that beeps every hour. and no of beeps should be equal to no of hours. such as for 12 o'clock it should beep 12 times.</p>
<p>but I have no idea how to detect change in hour. </p>
<pre><code>def bep(h):
    for i in range(h):
        winsound.Beep(2000,800)
        sleep(2)
</code></pre>
<p>the above code beeps for h no of times and </p>
<pre><code>def hour():
    return hour=int(time.ctime(time.time()).split()[3].split(':')[0])
</code></pre>
<p>it gives the hour.
but how to detect that hour has changed.</p>
<p>whether should I check every regular time interval and use previous hour and current hour to detect changes? I think this idea is not effective. because of time delay of interval time i.e.
check current time every 5 second and compare two successive check to detect change in hours.
is there any method to accomplish it directly.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>At its simplest:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
import time
current = 0
while True:
    time.sleep(5)
    if datetime.datetime.now().hour != current:
        current = datetime.datetime.now().hour
        print "beep" , str(current)
</code></pre>
<p>Note you can test the code by using .minute rather than .hour Which will allow you to see if it fits your purposes.<br/>
You will have to replace the <code>print "beep", str(current)</code> with a call to your function <code>bep(current)</code> </p>
<p>Also you might want to consider adding a little extra code to your <code>bep(h)</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>if h&gt;12: h=h-12
if h == 0: h = 12
</code></pre>
<p>To ensure that for example: at 16:00 you only hear 4 beeps rather than 16 and at midnight, you hear 12 beeps, rather than none.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at <code>sched</code> module. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html</a>. Also you can get the current hour using <code>datetime.now().hour</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">does this piece of code checks continuously the change in hour and notifies when hour has changed? it can be used for my script with simple modification if datetime.datetime.now().minute == 0: #call function that beeps and wait for a minute to avoid rechecking and evaluating if expression True and calling the beep function. am i right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>datetime.datetime.now().minute == 0</code> might ,not be the best check. I would rather  do like in this answer <code>datetime.datetime.now().minute != current</code> but with <code>.hour</code> instead of <code>.minute</code>. I guess @rolf-of-saxony did it per minute not to have to wait for an hour while testing</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BibekGhimire As Maarten suggested and I had supposed that I had made explicit, I used <code>.minute</code> purely for testing purposes. You should use <code>.hour</code>. I'll edit the answer.</span>
