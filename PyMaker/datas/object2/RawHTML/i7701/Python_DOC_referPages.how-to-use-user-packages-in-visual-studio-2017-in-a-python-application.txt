<p>I have this python application structure in Visual Studio 2017.
I created a <code>tests</code> folder using the Solution explorer and there's a <code>test.py</code> file in it.
I want to use the <code>test</code> module which is stored in <code>tests</code> directory. 
But when I try to use <code>import tests.test</code> it says <code>test</code> not defined.
I have just started learning python. 
I looked up to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/392473/how-do-i-add-an-existing-directory-tree-to-a-project-in-visual-studio">this</a> but I dont understand why isnt it working. Am I doing something wrong? I looked it up <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> </p>

<p>You are trying to import from from package. Each <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages" rel="nofollow noreferrer">package</a> must have an <code>__init__.py</code> file. You just have to add a blank file <code>__init__.py</code> to your <code>tests</code> folder and then it should be fine.</p>
