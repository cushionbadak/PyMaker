<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i have an xml (skin) file with the X and Y cordinates.
I have to divide (for 1.5) all the numbers inside the tags:</p>
<pre><code>position = "x, x" or size = "x, x"
</code></pre>
<p>example:</p>
<pre><code>position = "1700,90" size = "125,125"
</code></pre>
<p>becomes:</p>
<pre><code>position = "1113,60" size = "83,83"
</code></pre>
<p>The file is very large I can not make 1 to 1. I need a script (.sh or .py), I created something but unsuccessful.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>if file is very big, better is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.sax.html?highlight=sax#module-xml.sax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SAX xml parser</a>, or <a href="http://lxml.de" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://lxml.de</a> which uses libxml2 (very fast parser). I recommend SAX because you don't need DOM, only to find specific tag and change its attributes (?). Script will be like filter. Another option is to use <code>grep</code> but <code>grep</code> expression may be complex (I don't know how looks your XML file).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you be more concrete what is wrong(what errors you get) with what you have tried? Also put code that you came up with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried to write something in python but the code is complicated and I did not get anything concrete.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But still you need to make it more readable, SO community is passionate about helping, but making work for you won't make you any good(in understanding the problem). So i suggest you to try your best and if you got any errors, put them here as well as code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is not very big. I mean it's great to do this hand by dividing one by one all the numbers</span>
