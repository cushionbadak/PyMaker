<p>Can please anybody tell in few sentences: what are the advantages of coding from a command line then an IDE (like PyCharm for Python)? </p>
<p>I didn't find an answer, which could satisfy my interest and show the real practical meaning of coding from command line vs. IDE to an unexperienced programmer.</p>
<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: I rephrased my initial question which was about argparse package.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Even if I found some arguments - if anyone can bring another advantages of using IDE vs. cmd, please post them.</p>

<p>I made a small research outside of Python section and found a very similar <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2695919/why-do-people-use-command-line-instead-of-ide">question</a> from somebody who is learning C++.</p>
<p>Here I can sum up some the main advantages mentioned by other SO users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier to automate tasks, also in cross-platform processes</li>
<li>Too few bugs, in comparison to most IDEs.</li>
<li>More efficent for larger systems</li>
<li>Functionality of the Vim editor (Linux)</li>
</ul>
<p>After further research I understood that it is more typical for Linux users to code from a command line, then for (for example) Windows users. And of course it depends very much on developer's preferences.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Presumably you're importing it and calling run directly? What if you're calling the script directly from the command line? <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>"Parser for <b>command-line</b>"....</i></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I got it. Never executed code from cmd before.</span>
