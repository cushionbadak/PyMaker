<p>Life will be easier for you, as a programmer, if you use <strong>google</strong>. And I mean no offence. In this case, just query for <em>python round</em>.</p>
<p>In this particular case, if you want to round a float called <code>BMD</code> to two decimal places then you would use the following expression,</p>
<pre><code>round(BMD,2)
</code></pre>
<p>You might also be interested in how to use formatting to achieve a similar result. First I deliberately set <code>BMD</code> to a value that has only two decimal places. I can print it as-is but I have no control. In the second case, I set <code>BMD</code> to a value for quite a few decimal places but this time I limit the number of <em>output</em> decimal places. </p>
<p>In my opinion, it's safer to use <code>round</code> and then use the first formatting option because the second option could stumble with a value such as 345.22 (which occupies more than four columns overall).</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; BMD = 5.21
&gt;&gt;&gt; print ('BMD is {}'.format(BMD))
BMD is 5.21
&gt;&gt;&gt; BMD = 5.213333333333333
&gt;&gt;&gt; print ('BMD is {:4.2f}'.format(BMD))
BMD is 5.21
