<p>I've been making a sort of artificial intelligence (it's more like a long list of question - answer situations) and I've been looking to step up the complexity, but I know there's a way to shorten the amount of typing I have to do and I can't quite find it. Anyways, here's the long version of me asking for input, then checking the type of input (for example it's a question):</p>
<pre><code>a = input()
if "what" in a:
    a_type = question
if "where" in a:
    a_type = question
if "when" in a:
    a_type = question
if "why" in a:
    a_type = question
if "who" in a:
    a_type = question
</code></pre>
<p>and so on, then I would check for subject, mood, expression, etc...
If anybody knows <strong>how to condense all 5 of those statements</strong> that'd be great, thanks...</p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any()</code> function</a> with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#generator-expressions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">generator expression</a> to test words from a sequence against <code>a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>question_words = ['what', 'when', 'where', 'why', 'who']
if any(word in a for word in question_words):
    a_type = question
</code></pre>
<p><code>any()</code> iterates over the generator expression and returns <code>True</code> as soon as one of the <code>word in a</code> tests is true, or <code>False</code> when the generator expression is exhausted.</p>
