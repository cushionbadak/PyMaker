<p>In my .csv file, I have 32 rows, but I only want it to return 10 rows out of those 32. So if I want to return rows 2, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 27, 29, 30, 32, how would I go about doing that? </p>
<p>I have: </p>
<pre><code>read_poem_data = pd.read_csv('poem_data.csv')
print(read_poem_data.loc[2:3])
</code></pre>
<p>but this is only printing lines 2 and 3 of my file, when i want it to print 10 specific lines remove all the other lines from my .csv file.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>2:3 slices the data and gives you the rows 2 and 3. You have to provide all the rows you need like this</p>
<pre><code>df1 = read_poem_data.loc[[2, 7, 12, 13, 14, 17, 27, 29, 30, 32]]
</code></pre>
<p>To get it back in csv,</p>
<pre><code>df1.to_csv('poem_data.csv', index=False)
</code></pre>
