<p>Is there a way of calculating the average of the values of two or more lists or even dictionaries?</p>
<p>This is what I came up with:</p>
<pre><code>lista = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
listb = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

listavg = [0]*5
count = 0
for i in lista:
    listavg[count] = (i + listb[count]) / 2
    count += 1

print(listavg)
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<pre><code>[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>But what if I have 100 lists? And what if those lists are inside dictionaries like these:</p>
<pre><code>{'A': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'B': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 'C': [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], 'D': [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], 'E': [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], 'F': [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], 'G': [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], 'H': [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], 'I': [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], 'J': [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]}
</code></pre>
<p>P.S. the length of the list is always the same.</p>
<hr/>
<p>EDIT: Important note is that I want the average of each index, not the average of the list.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zip</a> and a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [sum(l)/len(l) for l in zip(*list_dict.values())]
[4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>zip()</code> to get a tuple of each element grouped together index-wise from the input lists, and use <code>sum()</code> to add them together:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def averages(*lists):
    return [sum(els) / len(els) for els in zip(*lists)]

&gt;&gt;&gt; averages([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
[3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>lista = [1, 2, 3, 4]
listb = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
lists = lista + listb
average = sum(lists) / len(lists) 
</code></pre>
<p>I think this works fine.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you can make your lists to tuple of column length vector then using #<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">statistics.mean</a> function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow, one line of code for my problem :D. Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you may have misunderstood my problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was unsure of the implication of your question. Could you please give me both the code used and the desired output. This will help me, as well as others, to help you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have already found a solution thanks to @Rawing and Christian Dean. What I wanted was to get the average values comparing 2 lists' indexes. I included an example output of what I was looking for.</span>
