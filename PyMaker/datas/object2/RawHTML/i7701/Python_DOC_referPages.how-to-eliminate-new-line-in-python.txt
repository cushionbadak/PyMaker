<p>I am new to python and I am having problem over the following syntax:</p>
<pre><code> for x in range(0, 10):
       print(x, ' ', end="")
</code></pre>
<p>I saw the syntax on a tutorial, however when I try it, it is giving me error. The goal I am trying to reach is printing 0 to 9 while eliminating new line. In other words, print 0 to 9 in a single line. Can you tell me what's wrong with the syntax if there is any?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To print in Python 2.7 without the line break you just need to add an extra comma to the end. It will also add a space between the numbers.</p>
<pre><code>for x in range(0, 10):
    print x,
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Are you using python 2? Because <code>print()</code> with <code>end</code> keyword argument is a Python 3 command.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>print</code> function with keyword <code>end</code> of Python 3 can be imported into Python 2 by
importing from <code>__future__</code> at the very beginning of the script:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
</code></pre>
<p>However, Python 2's <code>print</code> statement allows a syntax form without parentheses. This syntax will break with this import.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I know it is basic staff and at the same time, it is fundamental</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you using python 2 or python 3? Also, what's the error you're getting?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I checked the python version I have and looks like I it is version 2.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there a way to change the default python version from 2 to 3?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to install version 3, or are you saying that you already have both versions on you computer and want the <code>python</code> call to equal a <code>python3</code> call?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, I already installed python3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have also changed the default python to version 3 by using this command alias python=python3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">However, still when I try to run the python file, the same error persists</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok. that makes sense</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I checked the python version I have and looks like I it is version 2.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is it fixed now?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am using terminal to run the python and for some reason it is using the python2.7 version instead of python3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">instead of importing python 3 end keyword to python 2, why not make the default python version 3 rather than 2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is that possible?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AvaLucas Choose the Python version (2 or 3) and adapt the script accordingly, for example, see "<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Porting Python 2 Code to Python 3</a>". If you do not need modules, that require Python 2, then Python 3 is recommended for new projects.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have already changed the default version to 3. Yet, still getting invalid syntax</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AvaLucas Then, make a question with the error message and the code that causes the error.</span>
