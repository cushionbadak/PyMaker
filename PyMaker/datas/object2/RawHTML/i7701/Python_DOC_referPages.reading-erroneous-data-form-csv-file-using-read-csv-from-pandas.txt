<p>I am trying to read data from a huge csv file I have. I is showing me this error <code>UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xae in position 13: invalid start byte</code>. Is there any way to just skip through the lines that cause this exception to be thrown? From the millions of lines these are just a handful and I can't manually delete them. I tried adding error_bad_lines=False, but that did not solve the problem. I am using Python 3.6.1 that I got through Anaconda 4.4.0. I am also using a Mac if that helps. Please help me I am new to this. </p>

<p>Seems to me that there are some non-ascii characters in your file that cannot be decoded. Pandas accepts an encoding as an argument for read_csv (if that helps):</p>
<pre><code>my_file = pd.read_csv('Path/to/file.csv', encoding = 'encoding')
</code></pre>
<p>The default encoding is None, which is why you might be getting those errors.<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here is a link to the standard Python encodings</a> - Try "ISO-8859-1" (aka 'latin1') or maybe 'utf8' to start. </p>
<p>Pandas does allow you to specify rows to skip when reading a csv, but you would need to know the index of those rows, which in your case would be very difficult. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks I was able to read the csv file. However, for every black cell from the file, the DataFrame says nan. I want to construct an equality statement like <code>if df.col[0] == nan</code> then something. But that says nan is not defined. What can I put in the equality statement?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you want to remove rows that are "nan"? If you want to do that, you can do something like   <code>df = df[df.Column_name == "nan"]</code>  Should work, or  <code>df = df[df['Column_name'].str.compare("nan")]</code>  If you want to find the cell with the value, do something like  <code>if df.iat[i, j] == "nan"</code> with indices i and j</span>
