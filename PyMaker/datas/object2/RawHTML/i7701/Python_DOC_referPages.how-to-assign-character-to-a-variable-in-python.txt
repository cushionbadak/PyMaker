user = 'corp\adam' </p>
<p>Using python I am unable to create a user variable as desire. 
Desired Output:</p>
<p>user </p>
<p>'corp\adam'</p>
<p>I don't want to print the variable. I need to store it. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python (and commonly in other programming languages too) the backslash character is used to denote special characters that could not be typed directly into a string. This is known as an escape sequence. To specify a literal backslash, use it twice:</p>
<p><code>user = 'corp\\adam'</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try a double backslash, i.e. corp\\adam. The first backslash denotes that the second one has to be evaluated like a normal character, not as another escape character.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The backslash character acts as an escape when the next character is an ASCII or Python special escape character. Either escape the backslash with another backslash:</p>
<pre><code> 'corp\\adam'
</code></pre>
<p>or use a raw string (where backslash only escapes the quote character it doesn't even escape itself):</p>
<pre><code> r'corp\adam'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>r'corp\adam'</code> that way you tell Python it's a "raw" string and the backslash will not be used to escape other characters.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter 'r' or 'R'; such strings are called raw strings and treat backslashes as literal characters.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This isn't working.  Output based on your suggestion is 'corp\\adam' . Can you check on your end ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GauravP that <i>is what you are asking for</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're inspecting the value of <code>user</code> directly (e.g. by using the python interpreter) it will output the same way it is input. However the actual string representation has only one backslash: <code>len('\\') # returns 1</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you check by doing it ? I uploaded the screenshot for your ease.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GauravP it has been explained to you <b>repeatedly</b> that you are seeing the <code>repr</code> of the string, not the string itself.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">r'corp\adam'    results in output = 'corp\\adam'  . I tried just know</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GauravP: That's because you output the <code>repr</code> of the string (you probably just type the variable's name in the interactive interpreter). If you did <code>print(output)</code> the extra backslash wouldn't be there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GauravP That is the <code>repr</code> of the string, not the string itself. Using either a raw string or the double-backslash is the correct answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillage  - i need to use the variable later on as a password field. I don't want to print it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GauravP yes, so? What is it that you are not understanding? If you want, inspect the string character by character and you'll see it is <i>exactly what you want</i>. You are confused about the <code>repr</code></span>
