<p>Hi I want to add the current time and possibly date to an email message sent using python,
Its for a raspberry pi project i'm working on using an ultrasonic distance sensor,</p>
<p>I have the sensor placed on a meds box and if the box is moved a certain distance I want to send an email to myself with the text</p>
<p>"Your medicine box was moved at 04:15:32, Did you take your tablets?"</p>
<p>It works in so far as the email sends but the time looks like 041532</p>
<pre><code>import smtplib
import time


def send_mail():

    content = "Your medication box has been moved " + str(
        time.strftime("%I" "%M" "%S")
    ) + "Did you take your tablets?"

    mail = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    mail.ehlo()
    mail.starttls()
    mail.login('myEmailAddress', 'password')
    mail.sendmail('myEmaillAddress', 'myOtherEmailAddress', content)
    mail.close()
</code></pre>
<p>I tried adding colons to the time like so ("%I"":""%M"":""%S") but then the email was blank</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>time.strftime("%I:%M:%S")
</code></pre>
<p>essentially, the directives (the %X -es) get replaced with the respective values</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime

str(datetime.now())
</code></pre>
<p>you'll find more in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Don't add colons inside of the inverted commas. Doing it directly will work smoothly. </p>
<pre><code>time.strftime("%I:%M:%S") 
</code></pre>
<p>And if you want it in <strong>24-Hours Format</strong>, just replace <strong>%I with %H</strong>. So it would look like this: </p>
<pre><code>time.strftime("%H:%M:%S")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Why so many quotes? What happens with <code>"%I:%M:%S"</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just remove some quotes:  time.strftime("%I:%M:%S")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried it with one set of quotes "%I:%M%S" and the email appeared blank</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Something is weird here, because this is supposed to work (with single quotes, as everyone here was saying). Can you add a <code>print(content)</code> to your code and tell us the result?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It will print to the console perfectly with "%I:%M:%S" but the email appears blank for some reason</span>

<span class="comment-copy">oh yes, please fix your indentation. it may cause problems for your code too</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i tried  content = "Your medication box has been moved " + str(datetime.now()) + " Did you take your tablets?"    but again the email came in blank</span>
