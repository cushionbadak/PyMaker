<p>I created a program that added integers from a file into an array and then did something to them, but when I tried to add two files into the same array the code I was using didn't work. Here's the code I used for one file which worked fine:</p>
<pre><code>with open(files) as f:
        prime_list1 = [int(i) for line in f for i in line.split()]
</code></pre>
<p>But when I tried adding a second file, what I did din't work.</p>
<pre><code>with open(files) as f, open(files2) as b:
        prime_list1 = [int(i) for line in f for i in line.split() + int(i) for line in b for i in line.split()]
</code></pre>
<p>I know that that is not how you do it, I just couldn't figure out the correct way. I also realize that there already exists similar questions, but their answers did not work in my case. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Almost - you can do it as two separate list comprehensions,</p>
<pre><code>[int(i) for line in f for i in line.split()] + [int(i) for line in b for i in line.split()]
#                                          ^   ^
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just define your files in a list, loop through the list, open, read, convert to ints and, finally, concatenate them:</p>
<pre><code>files = ["file1", "file2"] # etc.
result = []
for file_name in files:
    with open(file_name, "r") as f:
        result += [int(i) for line in f for i in line.split()]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@vaultah No I don't</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should start reading a Python tutorial then. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@vaultah Ok thanks</span>
