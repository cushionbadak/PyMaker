<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list of floats:</p>
<pre><code>x = [1.69,1.69,2.36,2.63,2.63,3.00,3.00]
</code></pre>
<p>Finally I try to get a list with all equal numbers: </p>
<pre><code>y = [1.69,1.69,2.63,2.63,3.00,3.00]
</code></pre>
<p>and the indices of unique numbers:</p>
<pre><code> z = [2]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> to create a dict with the count for each unique value in the list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import collections
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [1.69,1.69,2.36,2.63,2.63,3.00,3.00]
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = collections.Counter(x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c
Counter({1.69: 2, 3.0: 2, 2.63: 2, 2.36: 1})
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can use some simple list comprehensions to get the unique and non-unique elements and/or their indices:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [e for e in x if c[e] &gt; 1]
[1.69, 1.69, 2.63, 2.63, 3.0, 3.0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [i for i, e in enumerate(x) if c[e] == 1]
[2]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the question here? What are you trying to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TimBiegeleisen I've removed it and replaced it with Python (which they mentioned in the original copy)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are asking here two questions. 1) How do i get the indices of all unique numbers 2) How do i remove unique numbers. The way you asked the question makes it sound like rocket science..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am sorry for discomposure. Yes I want to remove all unique numbers, but also a list of their indices.</span>
