<p>In Python, how do I convert a list that contains strings and lists that have two values into a dictionary such that the key is the string and the value is a list of lists such that the first value of each list is the key.</p>
<p>For example, the current list I have is:</p>
<pre><code>['A', ['A', 1], 'B', ['B',1], ['B',2], 'C', ['C', 1], ['C',2], ['C',3]]
</code></pre>
<p>and I want the dictionary:</p>
<p><code>{'A': [['A', 1]], 'B': [['B',1], ['B',2]], 'C': [['C',1], ['C',2],</code> ['C',3]]}</p>
<p>Thank you. </p>
<p>EDIT: The number of lists that follow a string is arbitrary.</p>

<p>With this, no matter the order of the list, it selects exactly what you're looking for.</p>
<pre><code>def new(list_):
    new_dic = {x:[y for y in list_ if type(y) == list and y[0] == x] for x in list_ if type(x) == str}
    print(new_dic)

new(['A', ['A', 1], ['A',2], 'B', ['B',1], ['B',2], 'C', ['C', 1], ['C',2]])
</code></pre>

<pre><code>d = {l: [] for l in mylist if type(l) is str} 

for l in mylist:
    if type(l) is list:
        d[l[0]].append(l)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try <code>defaultdict</code> </p>
<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict
my_dict = defaultdict(list)
my_list = ['A', ['A', 1], ['A',2], 'B', ['B',1], ['B',2], 'C', ['C', 1], ['C',2]]
for index in my_list:
    if len(index) &gt; 1:
        my_dict[index[0]].append(index)
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like it doesn't matter what the string values are in your list. Based on the current structure of the list provided, and the required output, you can just check for the <em>lists</em> inside the list, and by using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">defaultdict</a> construct, you can simply just craft your dictionary accordingly: </p>
<pre><code>from collections import defaultdict

l = ['A', ['A', 1], 'B', ['B',1], ['B',2], 'C', ['C', 1], ['C',2], ['C',3]]

d = defaultdict(list)
for data in l:
    if type(data) is list:
        d[data[0]].append(data)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>defaultdict(&lt;class 'list'&gt;, {'A': [['A', 1]], 'C': [['C', 1], ['C', 2], ['C', 3]], 'B': [['B', 1], ['B', 2]]})
</code></pre>
<p>So, here, the <code>defaultdict</code> will take a list as its default collection value. Therefore, when adding a new key, the default value will be a list. As you iterate over the list, simply check the type of the data in the list. When you find a <code>list</code>, you insert it in to your dictionary taking the first value of that list as the key, and then append the list as the value. It should give you the output you are looking for. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried to create a dictionary with just keys and initial value 0 but I can't think of efficient way to populate the dictionary into what I want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please share the code so that we can help you better</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Currently trying the code of the answers below, but getting errors.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The values are empty list because you didn't evaluate if the first value of the lists match the key.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually you will get <code>KeyError</code> if first value of list does not match a key in the dictionary... you can catch this exception if it is not known if all lists will be added.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am getting TypeError: first argument must be callable or None</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Mat.S I copy pasted the code in my answer and it runs fine. What input are you providing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Mat.S note that list in defaultdict(list) is the standard type 'list' and not an already initialized list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, @Mat.S do not pass <i>your</i> list in to defaultdict. The <code>list</code> I am passing in <code>defaultdict</code> is the standard type <i>list</i> to declare to the <code>defaultdict</code> that the default value in the dictionary to be used is a list. If you look at my solution, it is complete. It works as is with the input you provided in your question. Look at it carefully, you will see how it works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Typing d = defaultdict(list) gives me the error for some reason.</span>
