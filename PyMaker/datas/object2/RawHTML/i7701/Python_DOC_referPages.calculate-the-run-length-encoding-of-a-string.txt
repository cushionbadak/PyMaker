<p>example if the string had "xxxyyz" the output would be 3x2y1z
I am not sure how to go about doing this question and I tried multiple methods but cant seem to get anywhere close to the output I want</p>
<pre><code>s = input("Please type a sentence or word: ")
i = 0
count = 1
while len(s) &lt;=i:
    if s[i] == s[i+1]:
         count = count+1
         s1 = count + s[i]
</code></pre>
<p>first week learning programming and I know what im doing up there is wrong hopefully someone could help clear and possibly explain what I should do
thank you!</p>

<p>this is a version you could try. it uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> to iterate over two adjacent characters of the input string at the same time and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> to be able to print what remains at the end of the loop:</p>
<pre><code>strg = "xxxyyz"

mult = 1
lgth = len(strg)
for i, (prev, nxt) in enumerate(zip(strg, strg[1:])):
    if prev != nxt:
        print('{}{}'.format(mult, prev), end='')
        mult = 1
    else:
        mult += 1
    if i == lgth-2:  # print what is left at the end of the string
        print('{}{}'.format(mult, nxt))
</code></pre>
<p>the loop will run over</p>
<pre><code>i (prev, nxt)
-------------
0 ('x', 'x')
1 ('x', 'x')
2 ('x', 'y')
3 ('y', 'y')
...
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>actually there is no need for the <code>enumerate</code>; <code>nxt</code> is accessible after the loop:</p>
<pre><code>mult = 1
for prev, nxt in zip(strg, strg[1:]):
    if prev != nxt:
        print('{}{}'.format(mult, prev), end='')
        mult = 1
    else:
        mult += 1
print('{}{}'.format(mult, nxt))
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use collections.Counter for it</p>
<pre><code>import collections
collections.Counter(your_string)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">thank you so much, now I just have to understand what enumerate and zip mean but it helps clear up all the other situations!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry, just another issue, when I put in xxxyyzz the output gives me 3x2y1y instead of 3x2y1z, I tried changing the "if i == lgth-2" and playing around wiht other sections but not sure why it gives y instead of z</span>
<span class="comment-copy">? ...i get <code>'3x2y2z'</code> for the input <code>'xxxyyzz'</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry, just retyped it carefully and it was a mistake on my behalf!</span>
