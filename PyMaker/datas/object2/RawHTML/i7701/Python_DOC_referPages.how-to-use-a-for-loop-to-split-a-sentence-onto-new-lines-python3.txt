<p>I know how to use a split() however, I'm having a bit of memory loss here. I want to use a FOR loop which will split up a user inputted sentence whenever a space occurs. Each word should thus be displayed on a seperate line when I run the program. Every time I run this, I'm just putting every letter onto a new line, but I want every word on a new line. My code so far: </p>
<pre><code>string = "My name is Graham"
length = len(string)
for index in range(length):
    if string[index] == " ":
        print(" ")
    else:
        print(string[index])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are several ways to do this ...</p>
<pre><code>listSplitted = [x for x in string.split(' ')]
for x in listSplitted:
    print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>you could also try to implement the split method yourself (which is closer to what you gave as example):</p>
<pre><code>lastIdx=0
for idx in range(length):
    if string[idx] == ' ':
        print(string[lastIdx:idx-1])
        lastIdx = idx+1
</code></pre>
<p>but you could also adapt the <code>print</code> method to do what you want:</p>
<pre><code>for idx in range(length):
    if string[idx] == ' ':
        print("") # this appends a new line
    else:
        print(string[idx], end='')
</code></pre>
<p>for the last case, please refer also to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=print#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=print#print</a> </p>
<p>( I have not tested the code in python, so there might be +-1 index offset, you'll easily find)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use list comprehension and <code>.join()</code> to do this in one line:</p>
<pre><code>print('\n'.join([x for x in string.split()]))
</code></pre>
<p>and if you wanna keep the spacing and print them too, you can use:</p>
<pre><code>print('\n \n'.join([x for x in string.split()]))
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use a <code>for-loop</code> as the following:</p>
<pre><code>for word in string.split():
    print(word)
    print(' ')
</code></pre>
<p>remove 2nd print if you don't want spaces.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You're not currently using split anywhere. Also note that Python for loop is a for each: you could replace your current code with <code>for char in string: print(char)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, I'm purposedly not using split as I want to print this on a new line on the shell. I know how to use split.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not clear to me why you're not just using it, then: <code>for word in string.split(): print(word)</code>. And why do you special case spaces?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm an idiot. Thanks! Had a brain freeze.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I like the last solution but it can be even shorter without second print. Instead you can just type: print(word, end = '  ')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Nenad But it was mentioned that each word should be printed in a new line including the space =)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see. Then you can write something like this: for word in string.split(): 	print(' ' + word, end = '\n')</span>
