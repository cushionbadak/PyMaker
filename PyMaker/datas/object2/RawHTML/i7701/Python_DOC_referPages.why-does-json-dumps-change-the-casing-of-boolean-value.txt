<p>I've been using <code>json.dumps()</code> to create some templates but when using it, it changes the casing of my boolean values
Here's how to replicate:</p>
<pre><code>import json

test_obj = {'field': False}
print json.dumps(test_obj)
# prints {"field": false}
</code></pre>
<p>What's the reason for this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>json.dumps()</code> converts a Python dictionary to a JSON object formatted as a string. According to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSON specification</a>, the two boolean literals in JSON are <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. So, <code>json.dumps()</code> isn't changing the casing, it's only converting Python's boolean literals, <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>, to JSON's boolean literals, <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, respectively.</p>
<p>If you do wish to get a string representation of the Python dictionary without converting to JSON, you could cast the dictionary to string using <code>str()</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>JSON stands for <code>JavaScript Object Notation</code> and <code>true</code> is boolean representation in JS. Compare with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#encoders-and-decoders" rel="nofollow noreferrer">these docs</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Might have to do with it being lowercase is Javascript, and therefore maybe lowercase by the JSON spec?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Carcigenicate I actually was about to edit and write that as a suggestion! That would make a lot of sense.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kermitvomit Regardless, that must be just a string representation. It shouldn't actually effect anything unless you try to <code>eval</code> what <code>dumps</code> gives you.</span>
