<p>I want to create a histogram with broken axes and found that there must be a module doing this called brokenaxes that works together with matplotlib (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5656798/python-matplotlib-is-there-a-way-to-make-a-discontinuous-axis/44541588?noredirect=1#comment76073755_44541588">source) </a>. 
Anyway, when I trie  to import the module like this:</p>
<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from brokenaxes import brokenaxes
</code></pre>
<p>I get this error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No module named brokenaxes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm using ipython5.1 in anaconda 4.3.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In order to use a module it has to be installed. This can be done via</p>
<pre><code>pip install brokenaxes
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/installing/</a></p>
<p><strike>However, it seems that the brokenaxes you get from the python package index is currently (as of June 2017) broken (as the name says it ;-)). </strike> It should now (as of August 2017) be working again (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45828148/4124317">answer</a> by package maintainer below).</p>
<p>Alternatively
go to <a href="https://github.com/bendichter/brokenaxes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/bendichter/brokenaxes</a>, download the files and copy
<code>brokenaxes.py</code> into your python's site-packages folder. </p>

<p>Package creator here. There was a bug in the install script. It worked despite the bug in previous versions of pip, but if you have the most recent version the install broke. I fixed it today, so you should be able to run:
<code>
pip install brokenaxes==0.2
</code>
to get the latest version. Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for bringing this to my attention.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I am still a beginner. I tried to install like this: '(C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3) C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;ipython -m pip install brokenaxes' and got many responses like this:   Requirement already satisfied: brokenaxes in c:\programdata\anaconda3\lib\site-packagesRequirement already satisfied: matplotlib in C:\programdata\anaconda3\lib\site-packages (from brokenaxes). but it'still not working</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but I got no error for the install part</span>
<span class="comment-copy">By "not working" what exactly do you mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I get the same error message when I try to import it: no module named broekenaxes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I guess you have installed it for the wrong python. Do you have several python distributions on your machine? In the question you say you're using Anaconda 4 but the install path you quote says Anaconda3.</span>
