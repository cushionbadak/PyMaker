<p>I wanted to check which version of sqlite I had, which has become way more confusing than I expected. To start fresh, I created a new conda environment with:</p>
<pre><code>conda create --name my_env_name python=3.6 sqlite hdf5 pandas
</code></pre>
<p>The shell message said it would install <code>sqlite: 3.13.0-1</code> in the new environment, along with a few other packages.</p>
<p>Then, after activating that new conda environment, I immediately ran <code>pip freeze</code>, but the list of packages I see does not include any entry for <code>sqlite</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, I just enter <code>python</code> from the terminal (in this conda env) to enter a system python in my shell. The opening message says python version 3.6.1, confirming I'm in that newly created environment. But then </p>
<pre><code>import sqlite3
sqlite3.version
</code></pre>
<p>outputs <code>'2.6.0'</code></p>
<p>What's going on? Do I have sqlite3 version 3.13 installed or 2.6? If my sqlite3 version is 2.6, how do I get something newer? That would be pretty old.</p>

<p>Yes, you have installed the <code>sqlite: 3.13.0-1</code> version of sqlite database. If you want to check, run <code>sqlite3 --version</code></p>
<pre><code>import sqlite3
sqlite3.version
</code></pre>
<p>Here you get version for DB-API 2.0 interface for SQLite which is <code>2.6.0</code></p>

<li><p>Import sqlite3 into your python script:</p>
<pre><code>import sqlite3
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Add the following lines to your script:</p>
<pre><code>print "SQLite Version is:", sqlite3.sqlite_version
print "DB-API Version is:", sqlite3.version
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Running the script produced the following results for me (your results may differ):</p>
<pre><code>SQLite Version is: 3.11.0
DB-API Version is: 2.6.0 
</code></pre></li>
