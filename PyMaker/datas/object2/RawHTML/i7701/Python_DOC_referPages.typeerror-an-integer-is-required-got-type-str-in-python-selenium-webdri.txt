<p>This line is incorrect:</p>
<pre><code>outfile=open(directory1,"\maintest.html","w")
</code></pre>
<p>According to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation of the built-in <code>open</code> function</a>, its first three arguments are expected to be</p>
<ol>
<li>the <em>file path</em> (a string)</li>
<li>the <em>mode</em> in which the file is opened (a string)</li>
<li>the <em>buffering policy</em> (an integer)</li>
</ol>
<p>The way you are invoking the function, you are passing the following arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>file path</em> → <code>directory1</code></li>
<li><em>mode</em> → <code>"\maintest.html"</code></li>
<li><em>buffering</em> → <code>"w"</code> – This is wrong, an integer is expected.</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems that you actually want to use <code>&lt;directory1&gt;\maintest.html</code> as the file path and <code>"w"</code> as the opening mode.</p>
<p>In order to do that, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.path.join</code></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>outfile = open(os.path.join(directory1, "maintest.html"), "w")
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that you have to omit the <code>\</code>, which would have meant <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">something different</a> anyway.)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Which line is giving you the error? The error itself means that you are giving a string as input of a function that instead requires an integer. Note that you are probably giving something like " 1" instead 1. In that case you can cast to int with int(strin_to_be_casted)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you mkrieger1 it is working now but still showing error like <b>TypeError: join() argument must be str or bytes, not 'TextIOWrapper'</b>.would you please check it for once.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><b>EC:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\lib\unittest\case.py:629: ResourceWarning: unclosed file &lt;_io.TextIOWrapper</b> this error is comming please help me out this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know right now what is causing that error. You will have to do some debugging yourself. Please see <a href="https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs</a></span>
