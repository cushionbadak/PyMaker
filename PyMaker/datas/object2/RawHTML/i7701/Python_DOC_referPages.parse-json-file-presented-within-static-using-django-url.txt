<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am having json file in my django app. I have parsed it to fetch json using <code>json.loads</code> and returned as django URL.</p>
<p>I tried this,</p>
<pre><code>json_file_path = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static', "utils/config/AccessConf.json")
data = open(json_file_path, 'r')
parsed_json = json.loads(data.read())
print parsed_json
</code></pre>
<p>it is working code. but i want to know is there any better/optimized method than this? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of json.loads, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load" rel="nofollow noreferrer">json.load</a> which uses the file object directly:</p>
<pre><code>data = open(json_file_path, 'r')
parsed_json = json.load(data)
</code></pre>
<p>This saves a little bit of code, and may save some memory if you have big JSON files.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you could use <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">with</a> to close the file when done with it:</p>
<pre><code>with open(json_file_path, 'r') as data:
    parsed_json = json.load(data)
</code></pre>
<p>This closes the file as soon as you exit the "with" block.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It seems like you are using Python 2. If you are just beginning to learn Python, it may be better to program in Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i know and tried this method. but i want to know is there anything like URL parsing?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. If you have a specific question about how to do URL parsing, feel free to ask a new question here that states what you want to do exactly and what you have tried already.</span>
