<p>Is there a way to execute a method automatically from a python file after each command input while in python interactive?</p>
<p>For example:
If I have a method that prints information about file, but I do not want to call that method constantly, how can I make it output after each command in python interactive?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.displayhook" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sys.displayhook</a> is the function called to display values in the interactive interpreter. You can provide your own that performs other actions:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+2
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; original_display_hook = sys.displayhook
&gt;&gt;&gt; def my_display_hook(value):
...     original_display_hook(value)
...     print("Hello there from the hook!")
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.displayhook = my_display_hook
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2+2
4
Hello there from the hook!
&gt;&gt;&gt;

<span class="comment-copy">Python's interactive interpreter is meant to be for simple testing. Check <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pdb</code></a> module. As far as I know there's nothing like what you asked. You can very easily wrap your code with testing logic in a module and then test your code interactively, so you don't have to call the function each time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perfect! Thanks!</span>
