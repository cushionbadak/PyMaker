<p>To prepend to a list, I use the_list[0:0]. But with slice appending:</p>
<ul>
<li>[-0:-0] doesn't work.  </li>
<li>[::-1][0:0] doesn't work.  </li>
<li>And obviously [-1:-1] won't work.</li>
<li>[len(the_list), len(the_list)] doesn't count -- looking for just numbers here</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: </p>
<pre><code>results = [3,1,0]
results[-1:-1] = [3]
print(results)

&gt;&gt;&gt; [3,1,3,0]

results[-0:-0] = 5
print(results)

&gt;&gt;&gt; [5,3,1,3,0]

results = [3,1,0]
results[-1:-1] = [3]
print(results)

&gt;&gt;&gt; [3,1,3,0]

results[-0:-0] = 5
print(results)

&gt;&gt;&gt; [5,3,1,3,0]
</code></pre>
<p>Thoughts? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The slice that starts after the last element is <code>len(â€¦):</code>.</p>
<pre><code>results[len(results):] = [3]
</code></pre>
<p>but why, when there are <code>+=</code> and <code>extend</code>?</p>
<pre><code>results += [3]
results.extend([3])
</code></pre>

<p>I think you want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#typesseq-mutable" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list.extend</code></a>.  This can be used to add the members of one list to the end of another.</p>
<pre><code>l1 = [1, 2, 3]
l2 = [4, 5, 6]

l1.extend(l2)    # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">How are you able to prepend in the first place? Which python are you using?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No methods. Just a  [0:0] slice operator. (the_list[0:0])</span>
<span class="comment-copy">True. I was trying to go without using len(). Will edit my question for that. += works. And by inference, I'll say there's no slice operator for appending.</span>
