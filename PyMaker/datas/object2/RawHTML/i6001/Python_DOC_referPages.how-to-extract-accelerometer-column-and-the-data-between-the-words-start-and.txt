<p>I am new to python , so just learnt to read and write files but how can I extract the data between the keywords "start" and "stop" and save it to a new file? There are more than 10 columns but I want to extract only 4 columns with specific title.</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>. <code>reader</code> is a method of the <code>csv</code> package, not of a string.  YOu open the file and pass the file handle to <code>csv.reader</code>.  In your case, something like</p>
<pre><code>csv_reader = csv.reader(datafile)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what you're planning to do with <code>path</code>, the second <code>open</code> on your file.  You open it in "read" mode, but later use that as data to write out.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That was just practice. I want to extract the data between two keywords and then write that into a new file.</span>
