<p>In Selenium Webdriver , I am working on Python in Pycharm In which I am using simple class in which two methods are called to open URL in Chrome and Safari respectively.</p>
<pre><code>from selenium import webdriver


    class Automation():
        def Safari(self):
            driver = webdriver.Safari()
            driver.get('https://bizplace.theentertainerme.com')

        def Chrome(self):
            driver = webdriver.Chrome('/usr/local/bin/chromedriver')
            driver.get('https://bizplace.theentertainerme.com')

    auto = Automation
    auto.Safari(self)
</code></pre>
<p>Now After Executing it, I am getting an error like this:</p>
<pre><code>    auto.Safari(self)
NameError: name 'self' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to install self package via command line, its throwing me an error like this:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
      File "/private/var/folders/hh/bwg2n8w54cd7852cx91v21qm0000gp/T/pip-build-XVmlLB/public/setup.py", line 28, in &lt;module&gt;
        setup_cfg_data = read_configuration(path)

        val = open(val).read()
    IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './README.rst'
</code></pre>
<p>Can some one help me here.</p>

<p>Not sure why you are trying to install <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/self/0.0.14" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the self package</a>, you are not using it in your code, and you do not need it.</p>
<p>Your issue is a simple mistake here when calling your method:</p>
<pre><code>auto = Automation
auto.Safari(self)
</code></pre>
<p>This code is outside your class, the name <code>self</code> is not defined here, and you get the error you are seeing:</p>
<pre><code>NameError: name 'self' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>The correct way to call your method would be this:</p>
<pre><code>auto = Automation
auto.Safari()
</code></pre>
<p>Since you are calling a method of an instance, <code>self</code> (the instance that the actual method you called belongs to) will <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2709821/what-is-the-purpose-of-self">automatically be passed as first argument</a>.</p>
<p><em>Do not take this the wrong way, but I think you need to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">work your way through the Python tutorial</a>, as this is somewhat of a basic mistake, and with more complicated code you will run into countless issues like this one and will not enjoy working on your project.</em></p>
