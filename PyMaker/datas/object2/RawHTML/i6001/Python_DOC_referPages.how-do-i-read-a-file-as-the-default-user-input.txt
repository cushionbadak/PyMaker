<p>How do I read a whole file in python 3.6.x using the user <code>input()</code> function? Like the algorithms challenge sites do. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I have a file with the following content:</p>
<pre><code>line 1
line 2
line 3
end
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>My program would do something like:</p>
<pre><code>x = input()
while x != 'end':
    print("I am at", x)
    x = input()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then I would have as output:</p>
<pre><code>I am at line 1
I am at line 2
I am at line 3
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>I guess I need to wrap my python sample progam with another program (possible also python, or OS script) that call the first one passing the file as user input. But how could I do it?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Usually such challenges will pipe the input via stdin, and expected the response via stdout.</p>
<p>To do that, run your command from a command line like so;</p>
<pre><code>python program.py &lt; input.txt
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to save the output of the script into a file, you can redirect it to one.</p>
<pre><code>python program.py &lt; input.txt &gt; output.txt
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The usual standard lib tool for this job is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fileinput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>fileinput</code></a> module:</p>
<pre><code>import fileinput

for line in fileinput.input():
    print(f'working with line {line}')
</code></pre>
<p>Then from the shell, take your pick of the following (they all work):</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 my_script.py my_file.txt
$ python3 my_script.py &lt; my_file.txt
$ cat my_file.txt | python3 my_script.py
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, @Shadow! I wish I could put you and @wim answers as correct. But I can't do it and he was faster. HAHAHA... My best!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Technically I was 3 minutes faster (mouse over the 'answered 1 hour ago' to see the timestamp :P But I don't mind either way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ops! You're right. To keep things fair I have set your answer as correct. Sorry for the mess, guys.</span>
