<p>How do I use polynomials and derivatives in Python without external downloads? I see all of these external downloads to use, but I am unable to download them (IDK why). Does anyone know hoe I would represent, and manipulate, a polynomial. And if it is possible, how do I allow the user to input their own polynomial, and manipulate that?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can create a class to represent polynomials. In the example below, the coefficients are held in a list whose indices are the exponents of x:</p>
<pre><code>class Poly:
    def __init__(self, coefficients):
        self.coeffs = coefficients[:]

    def __str__(self):
        res = []
        for exponent, c in enumerate(self.coeffs):
            if c == 0:
                continue
            elif exponent == 0:
                res.append(str(c))
            elif exponent == 1:
                res.append(' + ' + str(c) + '*' + 'x')
            else:
                res.append(' + ' + str(c) + '*' + 'x^' + str(exponent))
        return ''.join(res)

    def derivative(self):
        return Poly([(exponent+1)*c for exponent, c in enumerate(self.coeffs[1:])])


quad = Poly([2, 3, 4])
print(quad)
print(quad.derivative())
</code></pre>
<h3>output:</h3>
<pre><code>2 + 3*x + 4*x^2
3 + 8*x
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You basically have two choices:  (1) Use an externally developed package, which you will need to download, or (2) Implement it all yourself.  Option 1 is clearly simpler.  Option 2 might be fun as an academic exercise, but is likely over your head.  If you really want to attempt option 2, then you will need to write some code, posting here only if you run into a problem that you are unable to resolve.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">maybe your question should be, why can't you download these tools?</span>
