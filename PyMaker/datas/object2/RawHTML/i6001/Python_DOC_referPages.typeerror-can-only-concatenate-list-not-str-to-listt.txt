<p>Dear Python Professionals, please help as the code mentioned below:</p>
<pre><code>klci = ['1015', '6399', '6888', '4162', '1023', '6947', '3034']
klse = '.KL'
tickers = klci + klse

print(tickers)
</code></pre>
<p>My expected result is:</p>
<pre><code>['1015.KL', '6399.KL', '6888.KL', '4162.KL', '1023.KL', '6947.KL', '3034.KL']
</code></pre>

<pre><code>klci = ['1015', '6399', '6888', '4162', '1023', '6947', '3034']
klse = '.KL'
tickers = [x + klse for x in klci]

print(tickers)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>['1015.KL', '6399.KL', '6888.KL', '4162.KL', '1023.KL', '6947.KL', '3034.KL']

<p>I'm not a Professionals. But, if it's my code </p>
<pre><code>klci = ['1015', '6399', '6888', '4162', '1023', '6947', '3034']
klse = '.KL'
for ele in range(len(klci)):
   klci[ele] += klse
tickers = klci
print(tickers)
</code></pre>
<p>It's work well :D</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>tickers = [x + klse for x in klci]</code>. You cannot code without doing <b>any</b> reading. So do some.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ev.Kounis there is a nicer way of putting that. And for the question in hand, the idea is that you have to add each element together separately, in a loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The question to the OP would be: "Where did you get the information that it would work like this?". If it's from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a> we might suggest a better explanation there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot as well, this one works too!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">nice try! But not, that juggling with <code>index</code>es like that is an error-prone way of doing things. Using Python one can write much more elegant code. Take a look at what the standard way of looping through <code>list</code>s is (<code>enumerate</code>, aso..)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much!!!! IT WORKS! Thank you XD</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why do you need <code>range(len(klci))</code>  ? why you calling them unnecessarily ??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank for commenting. I just start learning for python, I gonna trying hard work for my coding skill !</span>
