<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>year=[1,2,3,5,4,5,5] 
name=["alex","tom","amy","mary","peter","david","tim"]
maxyear=([i for i, x in enumerate(year) if x == max(year)])
</code></pre>
<p>I want these code below shorter,wanna write in one line only,like I defiened the maxyear list.</p>
<pre><code>oldername=[]
for i in maxyear:
 oldername.append(name[i])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To put the code on one line you can simply do:</p>
<pre><code>oldername = [name[i] for i in maxyear]
</code></pre>
<p>The correct syntax for this should be (with spaces!):</p>
<pre><code>year = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 5, 5] 
name = ["alex", "tom", "amy", "mary", "peter", "david", "tim"]
maxyear = ([i for i, x in enumerate(year) if x == max(year)])

oldername = [name[i] for i in maxyear]
</code></pre>
<p>For the sake of good practice, it may be worth taking the 'max(year)' out of the 'for statement' and storing it as a variable. This saves performing the max calculation every time.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your <code>name</code> variable assignation does not work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have a syntax error at line 3: <code>max()</code> is not closed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What you wanna do is to use "list comprehension", read about it, how to use it. No point to giving you result, if you won't know how it works anyway. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>max(year)</code> : calling max func with every iteration is not a good practice, you can store max of year in 1 variable and then use it, it will save your time and performance</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In something like Python in a small program it will really make no difference to speed, but I get your point - it is bad practice to do this. I'll add a note to the answer</span>
