<p>I am writing a password strength checker in python and need to see if the password contains numbers, lowercase letters, and uppercase letters. Only 1 type is weak, 2 types are Medium and all three types is Strong.</p>
<p>The password is input as password2 and I have created arrays with all letters (lower and upper separately) and 0-9 individually input as strings in three arrays.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.
Cheers,

<p>Simple approach to point you in some direction. This makes use of some utils like the <code>string</code> module and the built-in <code>any</code> and <code>sum</code> functions as well as type coercion when summing <code>bools</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from string import ascii_uppercase as u, ascii_lowercase as l, digits as d

def strength(password):
    return sum(any(c in chars for c in password) for chars in (u, l, d))

&gt;&gt;&gt; strength('abc')
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; strength('abc123')
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; strength('abcD123')
3
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure whether I understand it correctly</p>
<pre><code># s is password input
has_num = any(map(str.isalnum, s))       # True or False
has_lower = any(map(str.islower, s))
has_upper = any(map(str.isupper, s))
n_types = sum((has_num, has_lower, has_upper))    # type count
</code></pre>
