<p>I have been programming for a total of three weeks.  I am stuck on this problem right now: </p>
<p>We will pass you 2 inputs:</p>
<p>A list of numbers</p>
<p>A number, N, to look for</p>
<p>Your job is to loop through the list and find the number specified in the second input. Output the list element index where you find the number.</p>
<p>If N is not found in the list, output -1.</p>
<p>This is what I have so far: </p>
<h1>import and N were provided</h1>
<pre><code>import sys
N= int(sys.argv[2])
</code></pre>
<h1>this is also provided</h1>
<pre><code>numbers= []
for i in sys.argv[1].split(","):
    if(i.isdigit()):
        numbers.append(int(i))
</code></pre>
<h1>mycode</h1>
<pre><code>for i in numbers: 
    if N in numbers: 
        print(i)
    elif N not in numbers: 
        print(-1)
</code></pre>
<p>This outputs the following for the random number inputs: </p>
<p>Program Failed for Input: 1,3,11,42,12 2
Expected Output: -1
Your Program Output: -1
-1
-1
-1
-1</p>
<p>This is not working and returns -1 for every number N that is not in the list numbers.  I have tried using a break statement before and after print, but that stops it from printing at all.  Any suggestions? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Thank you for your comments and answers.  After messing around with it a bit, this is what ended up providing the proper output: </p>
<h1>My Code:</h1>
<pre><code>if N in numbers: 
    print (numbers.index(N))
if N not in numbers: 
    print(-1) 
</code></pre>
<h1>Output:</h1>
<p>Program Output</p>
<p>Input: 1,3,11,42,12 42
Your Output: 3

<p>Well done!</p>

<pre><code>import sys

print "\n"

numbers= []
for i in sys.argv[1].split(","):

i = 0


for num in numbers:

    if num == N:
        print "number found at index %d " % (i)

    i+=1
</code></pre>
<p>run this with <code>python program_name.py [,x,y,z,l,m,n,] N</code> where x,y,z,l,m,n are the numbers in the list and N is the number you search ( note the <code>[,</code> and <code>,]</code> )</p>

<span class="comment-copy">When you are looping through the list, you don't want to check whether the number is in the list (you wouldn't need to loop for that); you want to compare the number to the current item of the list and check whether they match. There is another thing missing from your solution: a counter that tells you the current position, when looping, so you can get the index when there is a match.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">take a look at the wonderful <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate()</code></a> function to iterate the list by element + index pairs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, I thought you weren't allowed to use <code>index</code> and really had to loop. That's a good solution then. You could use <code>elif</code> instead of the second <code>if</code>, or <code>else</code> if you don't want to be explicit, or even just in one line: <code>print(numbers.index(N) if N in numbers else -1)</code>. A different approach would be to use a <code>try/except</code> block instead of the two <code>if</code>s.</span>
