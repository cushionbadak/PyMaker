<p>I have tons of <code>timestamp</code> strings like this one <code>2017-04-18 05:03:40.966084</code> and the script needs to add seconds to the <code>timestamp</code>. I have been trying to turn the string into a legit <code>timestamp</code> object and then add seconds to it with <code>timedelta</code> but for some reason it isn't working.</p>
<p>This is what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>duration = "150.100"
timestamp = datetime.strptime(timestamp, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f")
timestamp_e = timestamp+timedelta(seconds=duration)
</code></pre>
<p>Am I going at this the right way?</p>

<p>Yes <code>timedelta</code> is a good way to adjust a timestamp. However note that your <code>duration</code> variable is a string. As per the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> it should be an integer or float:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All arguments are optional and default to 0. Arguments may be integers or floats, and may be positive or negative.</p>
