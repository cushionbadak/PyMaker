<p>You need to add python to your environment variables </p>
<ol>
<li>Computer -&gt; System Properties (or <kbd>Win+Break</kbd>) -&gt; Advanced System Settings</li>
<li>Click the <code>Environment variables</code> button (in the Advanced tab)</li>
<li>Edit <code>PATH</code> and append <code>;C:\Python27</code> to the end (if you need substitute your Python version)</li>
<li>Click OK. Note that changes to the PATH are only reflected in command prompts opened <em>after</em> the change took place.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>If you are running python 3.6 you will need to add python to your environment path through command prompt</p>
<p>Windows allows environment variables to be configured permanently at both the User level and the System level, or temporarily in a command prompt.</p>
<p>To temporarily set environment variables, open Command Prompt and use the set command:</p>
<pre><code>set PATH=C:\Program Files\Python 3.6;%PATH%
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\My_python_lib
</code></pre>
<p>These changes will apply to any further commands executed in that console and will be inherited by any applications started from the console.</p>
<p>To change System variables, you need non-restricted access to your machine (i.e. Administrator rights).</p>
<p>If you were to run <code>python -v</code> it should now work</p>
<p>This came directly from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python documents</a> section 3.3.1</p>
<hr/>
<p>Now after you restart you should be able to access python through the command line. If you are running 2.7.9+ or 3.4+ pip will come prepackaged with python. However, if you are running an earlier version of python </p>
<p>Per <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip</a>:</p>
<p>Download get-pip.py, being careful to save it as a .py file rather than .txt. Then, run it from the command prompt:</p>
<p>python get-pip.py
You possibly need an administrator command prompt to do this. Follow Start a Command Prompt as an Administrator (Microsoft TechNet).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@SuitBoyApps I tried following that but when I run python get-pip.py it says python is not a recognized command</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does just the command <code>python</code> work at all?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SuitBoyApps No, it just says it's not recognized</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I posted an answer that will cover what you need to do to link python into your environment variables</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I had already done that but it still doesn't work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you installed python already? What version of python are you running?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have 2.7 and 3.6.3 but I only wan to use 3.6.3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, well you would need to change the <code>python27</code> to <code>python36</code> (however I do not run windows and I cannot be 100% sure). Please read section 3.3.1 in this article to set up an environment path for 3.6 in windows <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I modified the python installer to add python to environment variables so now it works! Thank you so much for your help :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I had already done that but it still doesn't work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@T.Green Just for future reference if you have tried something please include that in your question. Let us know all of the debugging steps that you have already tried so it makes it easier for us to know how to help you instead of having us make suggestions on how to fix it and then afterwards telling us that you already tried that.</span>
