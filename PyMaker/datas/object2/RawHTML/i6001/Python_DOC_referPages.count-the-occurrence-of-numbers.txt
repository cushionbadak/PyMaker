<p>So I have to find the occurrences of each number in a list that the user is prompted to enter (numbers between 1 and 100), my idea was to count each number and then print it out if it occurs at all, and if it doesn't occur, do nothing. Any ideas to go off of this?</p>
<pre><code>il1 = eval(input("Enter integers between 1 and 100 "))

lst1 = []



for i in range(0,len(il1)):
    lst1.append(il1[i])

for i in range(0,len(lst1)):
    for j in range(1,100+1):
        if lst1.count([j]) != 0:
            print(i,"occurs",lst1.count[j],"times")
        else:
            continue
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: As the usage of <code>eval</code> is considered to be <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1832940/why-is-using-eval-a-bad-practice">bad practice</a>, I suggest parsing numbers via a regex. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4289557/8952900">Other</a> options with other properties are also possible.</p>
<pre><code>import re

LIMITS = (1, 100)

line = input("Enter integers between %d and %d: " % LIMITS)

# parse input for all possible numbers
numbers = [int(digits) for digits in re.findall(r'[0-9]+', line)]

# filter for valid numbers in given range
numbers = [n for n in numbers if LIMITS[0] &lt;= n &lt;= LIMITS[1]]

# count occurences; save in dict for easy use later
occurences = {}
for number in numbers:
    if number in occurences:
        occurences[number] += 1
    else:
        occurences[number] = 1

print(occurences)

<p>Yes, this could be squeezed into one line. But for readability, you shouldn't. :-)</p>

<p>In python you do :</p>
<pre><code>yourNum = 5
[1,2,3,4,5,5].count(yourNum)

<span class="comment-copy">Why use <code>eval</code>? <code>why are you calling </code>count()` with <code>j</code> encased in a list? why are you trying to access <code>count</code> with index <code>j</code>?  perhaps look into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Counter from the collection module</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You code python like java, you can do this in python with one line</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Why would you use regex for a given input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user1767754 In the sample code by the OP, the list of integer was given by using <code>eval</code>. This looks dangerous to me, whereas a regex seems like an alternative, robust solution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's overkill.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user1767754: How about <code>[int(s) for s in ''.join(c if c.isdigit() else ' ' for c in line).split()]</code> then? :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This seemed to have worked, thank you very much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Correct, but that doesn't seem to work in a loop.</span>
