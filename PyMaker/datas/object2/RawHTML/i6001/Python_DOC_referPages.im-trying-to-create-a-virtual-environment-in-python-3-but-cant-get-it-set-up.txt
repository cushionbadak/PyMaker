<p>So basically to create the virtual environment I'm running:</p>
<p>$ virtualenv -p python3 ve </p>
<p>But when I run this I get: "The path python3 (from --python=python3) does not exist"</p>
<p>So I tried to do a mkdir ve and that doesn't work either. I'm not very familiar with virtual environments so I've tried a bunch of things and nothing seems to work. Any help would be much appreciated!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It means that python3 is not on your path. You can test that with ...</p>
<pre><code>python3 --version
</code></pre>
<p>If you get an error your virtualenv creation will fail as well. </p>
<p>Just use the full path of your python executable with the -p flag i.e.:</p>
<pre><code>virtualenv -p /some_odd_location/bin/python3 env
</code></pre>
<p>In Windows this will be probably</p>
<pre><code>virtualenv -p C:\python3\bin\python3.exe env (I will verify tomorrow)
</code></pre>
<p>And of course make sure python3 is installed in the first place.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also symlink your python executable in /usr/bin but that will affect the global settings.</p>
<p>Virtual environments are not much more than alternative path settings in the shell where they are activated plus a clean python installation in the folder that you create by invoking virtualenv.</p>

<p>I usually create virtual environments with 
<code>python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment</code> (here's the documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html</a>)</p>
<p>To be able to do this you need to have installed python 3 globally.</p>
<p>Also if you want to use that environment you may need to activate it:</p>
<p><code>source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate</code></p>
<p>These commands work on Unix based systems.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What does <code>which python3</code> give you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just tried and I'm getting:  "'which' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then you are using significantly less linux than I assumed. It wouldn't hurt adding the windows tag to this question to make that more clear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>python3 --version</code> returns: 'python3' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.  but  <code>python --version</code> returns: Python 3.6.1 :: Anaconda 4.4.0 (64-bit)  I did have Python 2 installed a while back so does this mean that my Command Prompt is still referencing the older version? Should I just uninstall Python 2 altogether and start fresh? I also have Anaconda (if that makes a difference).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This means Python 3 is on your path. In that case simply calling virtualenv should create a virtual environment using Python 3.6.1. The executable for python 3 is still called 'python'. You might symlink it as python3 if you like to have both versions on hand. Your python 3 install might have overwritten the symlink to Python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot, I was able to run <code>virtualenv -p LOCATION ve</code> successfully to create a virtual environment.   But now the issue is getting activated. I tried <code>source ve/bin/activate</code> and <code>LOCATION ve/bin/activate</code> and looked around the site for answer but couldn't find anything. Any ideas? Thanks again!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you look into the ve folder? What is there?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, if you are on Windows you have to run ve\Scripts\activate.bat. Sorry for assuming you were on Linux or OSX. You are all good now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks this is helpful. But when I use   <code>python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment</code>  I get <b>python3' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</b>  I'm using Python 3 so not sure what's going on here</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which Operative System do you use?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm on Windows 10</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Again, python is not on your current path. You have two options. Set the PATH variable or find the executable and provide as argument to virtualenv.</span>
