<p>I am trying to work with multiple lists and I am new to Python. So, say I have 2 lists: </p>
<pre><code>lista = [1,2,3,4] 
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>listb = [up, right, left, down]
</code></pre>
<p><code>listb</code> are labels for <code>lista</code>. If I'm finding say the largest number from <code>lista</code>, I know how to do this part, how would I get the label for this number from <code>listb</code>? Since the answer is unknown and can change over time. I'm not sure how to get the related item from the other list.</p>
<p>Simplest answers are welcome! Its an assignment for a class. Thanks everyone!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Get index from the <code>lista</code>:</p>
<pre><code>i = lista.index(max(lista))
</code></pre>
<p>With this index get label from <code>listb</code>:</p>
<pre><code>label = listb[i]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>lista = [1,2,3,4] 
listb = [up, right, left, down]
print(listb[lista.index(max(lista)] + ' and ' + max(lista))
</code></pre>
<p>Simple, clear, and relatively readable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">instead of using list function, look in dict function, its better fit for what you trying to do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Create a dictionary <code>d = dict(zip(lista, listb))</code>. Call <code>m = max(lista)</code>, and use the value <code>m</code> to lookup the label with <code>d[m]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not allowed to edit the lists. So can' turn them into a dictionary. Also we haven't discussed the zip() at all so I don't know that I should use it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hmmm okay what if its a case of im looking for all items in lista that are greater than 2 and lista is [3, 1, 4, 2] listb [up, right, left, down] how would I get the lables that match up? I know how to find the items greater than 2 but then I dont know? would it be the same as this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're looking for all numbers greater than 2, you're no longer looking for the maximum number and this is a different question.  If this answers your question, please accept it as the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That was just an example though. I guess I didnt phrase the question properly.</span>
