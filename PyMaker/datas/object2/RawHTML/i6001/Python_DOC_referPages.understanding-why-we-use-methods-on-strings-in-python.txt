<p>I've just started learning Python and I've got to a point where I'm a little confused on why we use <code>.upper()</code> in, for example, <code>print("Hello, World!".upper())</code>. I've read through some answers provided on similar <em>stackoverflow</em> questions, any they all the general theme, "you use the notation <code>.upper()</code> for methods". </p>
<p>From my understanding, methods are just special cases of functions that belong to classes. If this is the case, why do we use things like <code>.upper()</code>, <code>.title()</code>, <code>.isalhpa()</code> etc. on simple strings like <code>"Hello, World!"</code> when they don't belong to a class?</p>

<p>A good thing to get comfortable with is checking types and methods of different objects. E.g.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; stringy = 'Hello world!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(stringy)
str
</code></pre>
<p>Then to get information on string-type objects:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; help(str)
class str(object)
# &lt;A description of the class will be here&gt;

Methods defined here:
# &lt;various methods&gt;
upper(...)
    S.upper() -&gt; str

    Return a copy of S converted to uppercase.
</code></pre>
<p>So what we were actually doing in our first line is creating an object of the str() class:</p>
<pre><code>stringy = str('Hello world!')
</code></pre>
<p>Hope that makes sense :-)    </p>

<p>As other people have pointed out this happens because in python strings, as all of the other types I am aware of, are objects. Strings specifically are objects of the <code>str</code> class. You may look <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for more on this.</p>
<p>Also methods usually refer to functions bound to objects. This excellent  <a href="https://julien.danjou.info/blog/2013/guide-python-static-class-abstract-methods" rel="nofollow noreferrer">post</a> about how methods work on python may interest you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">String is a class. Strings can have methods just like any other class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Its like Java, where strings are classes. You should try reading the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can also have <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#additional-methods-on-float" rel="nofollow noreferrer">methods on integer and float literals</a>. e.g <code>5.0.is_integer()</code> returns <code>True</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">In python every name refers to an object and every object has a type defined by a class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So, <code>"Hello, World!"</code> would just be an instance of the class, <code>String</code>?</span>
