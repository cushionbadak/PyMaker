<p>So, i am trying to write the values to each list from the loop...multiply hours by 20 and then write out to file "workers.txt".</p>

<p>Creating empty lists in the <code>with</code> statement doesn't map them to the file. You still need to actually call <code>filet.write</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You should write to the file. <code>print</code>, by default, writes to standard output (<code>sys.stdout</code>). Try with: <code>print(emp_num, file=filet)</code>.</span>
