<p>I worked in Python 3.6, and I am a beginner. So can anyone give me a true way of how can slice a list into variable size sub-list. I tried <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2231663/slicing-a-list-into-a-list-of-sub-lists">this</a> solution from this site, but it gave me fixed size of sliced list. To clarify:</p>
<p>if I have this list:</p>
<pre><code>inputList= [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
</code></pre>
<p>I want the output to be like e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>outputList=[[0,1,2], [3,4], [5], [6,7]]
</code></pre>
<p>each time it depends on (for example) user input or some variable size.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.islice()</code></a>. This has the added advantage that if you request a slice that you would normally take you out of bounds, you won't get an error. You'll just get as many items are left as possible.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import itertools as it
&gt;&gt;&gt; input_list = range(8)
&gt;&gt;&gt; slices = (3, 2, 1, 2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; iterable = iter(input_list)
&gt;&gt;&gt; output_list = [list(it.islice(iterable, sl)) for sl in slices]
&gt;&gt;&gt; output_list
[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4], [5], [6, 7]]
</code></pre>
<p>For example, if you had <code>slices = (3, 2, 1, 3, 2)</code>, your result would be <code>[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4], [5], [6, 7], []]</code>.</p>
<p>Basically, <code>iter(input_list)</code> creates an iterable of your list so you can fetch the next <code>k</code> values with <code>islice()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do this in a loop making use of python's <code>[:#]</code> slice notation:</p>
<p>Let's say the user's input for slicing chunk sizes is stored in a list. They want chunks of 3, 2, 1 and 2, so the user input defining the chunks gets stored into a list that has has <code>[3,2,1,2]</code>.</p>
<p>Then, loop through that list and use it to get your slices:</p>
<pre><code>input_list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
chunk_list = [3,2,1,2]
output_list = []
for i in chunk_list:
    output_list.append(input_list[:i])
    input_list = input_list[i:]
print(output_list)
</code></pre>
<p>Prints:</p>
<pre><code>[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4], [5], [6, 7]]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Probably you just want to learn about slicing. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-pythons-slice-notation">Understanding Python's slice notation</a></p>
<p>To get your example output, you could do</p>
<pre><code>outputList = [inputList[:3], inputList[3:5], inputList[5:6], inputList[6:]]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">How do you decide the slices? Your example doesn't offer us much to help you with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">for example in my own project I want to slice the list of number based on count of word occurrences in a text comes after a word. so this is not matter actually because I need the idea. i.e. let word occurrences = n, so whatever n is equal to? the list should slice in a sub-list based on n with its variable size each time as I mentioned above. i hope that is clear I don't no how can i explain it to you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">By the way, if anyone has a better way to say "python's <code>[:#]</code> slicing format", please do share. I realized how silly that looks, but I can't think of a better name.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">That sounds way better, thanks!</span>
