<p>I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle and am trying to execute the following code:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
movie_data = pd.read_csv('moviemetadata.csv', encoding = 'utf-8', delimiter = ',', header=0, decimal = '.')
print(movie_data.info)
</code></pre>
<p>Curiously, when I'm trying to run it inside Sublime Text or the Terminal (I'm on a Mac), it won't work and the following error gets thrown out:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
File ".../test.py", line 14, in &lt;module&gt;
print(movie_data.info) #UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xe5' in position 7356: ordinal not in range(128)
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xf3' in position 7559: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>
<p>I googled this error message and tried to find a fix, for example by including the "encoding = 'utf-8'", but this didn't fix it. I then tried to run the same code in jupyter, and it works flawlessly. I get exactly the output I want.</p>
<p>Does somebody have an idea what causes this and how I could get the same code to work in the terminal also?</p>
<p>Additional info: I'm using the same Python version in terminal and jupyter, and I saved the .csv specifically with utf-8 encoding.</p>

<p>You just have to do:</p>
<pre><code>movie_data.info()
</code></pre>
<p>Since <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.info.html#pandas-dataframe-info" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>info()</code></a> is a method.</p>
<p>There's also no need to wrap it in a <code>print</code> call as  <code>info()</code> already outputs to <code>sys.stdout</code> by default.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The reason why <code>print(movie_data.info)</code> worked on Jupyter and not on your terminal is likely due to encoding issues. When you try to print a non-string type, <code>print</code> will essentially attempt to convert the object to a string with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str()</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>repr()</code></a>. Since <code>movie_data.info</code> is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.MethodType" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>MethodType</code></a>, i.e. a bound method, <code>repr(movie_data.info)</code> will look something like <code>&lt;bound method DataFrame.info of ...&gt;</code> where <code>...</code> is the string representation of your dataframe. And because your dataframe contains some unicode values, so will its string representation; which if not properly encoded before piping to stdout, might give you an encoding error. (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/492483/8944057">see also</a>)</p>
<p>The general summary output of <code>info()</code> doesn't appear to include any cell or index values, but just column names. Unless your dataframe columns might also have unicode characters, you can just do <code>movie_data.info()</code>, otherwise, something like this to encode the columns first should also work:</p>
<pre><code>movie_data.columns = map(lambda s: s.encode('utf-8', 'ignore'), movie_data.columns)
movie_data.info()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you using the same Python version in Jupyter and on the terminal?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yep probably 2.7 in terminal (comes with MAC). I made a quick google and found that  <code>encoding = 'utf8'</code> without the dash. Did you try that? Probably should work with utf-8 though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>encoding = 'latin-1</code> maybe..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you can see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/492483/setting-the-correct-encoding-when-piping-stdout-in-python?rq=1">this question</a> which has a similar problem. Also, do you have a column named 'info' in your dataframe? I've just realised that this refers to a method <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.info.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>DataFrame.info()</code></a>. If you want to refer to the column you will need to do <code>movie_data["info"]</code>, and <code>apply()</code> should work on it afterwards.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@eugenhu I see. If you care to put this as an answer I will accept it. Thank you very much for your time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As I've written in the comments, 'movie_data.info()' is actually what I wanted. This is not to take from your explanation which is very informative, it was just that since 'movie_data.info' gave an output in jupyter I assumed there must be something wrong with my terminal. Your explanation cleared it all up for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@azureai Oh yeah that's right, my bad must have skimmed over that, I've edited my answer anyway for completeness sake. It's a little bit different but basically you can just have <code>movie_data.info()</code> without putting it in a <code>print</code> if you're not already doing that.</span>
