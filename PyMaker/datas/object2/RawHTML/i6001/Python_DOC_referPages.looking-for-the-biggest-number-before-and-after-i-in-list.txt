<p>I'm sorry if the title is confusing. Here's a better explanation:
So basically what I need to do is iterate through every number in list and print the biggest number west (list[0:i]) and the biggest number east. If the biggest number is smaller than i, we print i. So for list [1, 3, 2, 4, 3] the output should be:
1 4
3 4 
3 4
4 4
4 3</p>
<p>I thought my code was correct but it doesn't work for the last number in list, is anyone able to help?</p>
<p>'a' is the list in my code</p>
<pre><code>a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 3] 
for i in a:
    west = a[0:i]
    east = a[i:int(len(a))]
    if max(west) &gt; i:
        print(max(west))
    else:
        print(i)
    if max(east) &gt; i:
        print(max(east))
    else:
        print(i)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(a)): 
    print(max(a[:i+1]))
    print(max(a[i:]))
</code></pre>
<p>You are not iterating over the indices in your original code; and thus the partition does not make sense. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The only mistake in your code is the <code>for i in a</code> loop, which loops throgh <code>i = 1,3,2,4,3</code> and not <code>i=0,1,2,3,4</code></p>
<p>The following piece of code works  </p>
<pre><code>a=[1,3,2,4,3]
for i in range(len(a)) :
    print max(i,max(a[:i+1]))
    print max(i,max(a[i:]))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>this may work... not fully tested but it looks correct</p>
<pre><code>a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 3]
for i in a[:-1]:
    west = a[0:i]
    east = a[i:int(len(a))]
    if max(west) &gt; i:
        print(max(west))
    else:
        print(i)
    if max(east) &gt; i:
        print(max(east))
    else:
        print(i)
num = a[-1]
west = a[0:-1]
if max(west) &gt; num:
    print(max(west))
else:
    print(str(a[-1]))
print(str(a[-1]))
</code></pre>
<p>Output: 1 4 3 4 4 4 4 3</p>

<span class="comment-copy">your question is unclear, but <code>i</code> is the element in <code>a</code> and not the index, you know that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If I am in the southern hemisphere, is west left or right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What does <code>it doesn't work for the last number in list</code> mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Add <code>print('west:{}, i:{}, east:{}'.format(west, i, east))</code> just before the first condition to help you diagnose the problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wwii you are right, using west and east wasn't a good idea. Also I should've been more clear on what "it doesn't work for the last number in list" means. Thanks for your input, my mistake was that I thought i was the index in a. I have no idea why I didn't notice that though.</span>
