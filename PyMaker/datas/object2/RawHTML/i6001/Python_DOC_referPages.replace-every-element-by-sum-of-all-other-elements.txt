<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have to replace every element in the list by sum of all other elements in the list.</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3] =&gt; [5, 4, 3]
[1] =&gt; [0]
[2, 7, 9] =&gt; [16, 11, 9]
</code></pre>
<p>I have done so far:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(numbers)):
    numbers[i] = sum[numbers[:i]] + sum[numbers[i+1:]]
return numbers
</code></pre>
<p>But I'm keep getting <code>TypeError</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Elegant way to achieve this will be:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_list = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [sum(my_list)-x for x in my_list]
[5, 4, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>OR, even better to calculate <code>sum</code> outside the <em>list comprehension</em> so that you won't have to calculate it each time (as pointed by <em>@Jean</em>):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_sum = sum(my_list)
&gt;&gt;&gt; [my_sum-x for x in my_list]
[5, 4, 3]
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Issue with your code:</strong> You are not making call <code>()</code> to <code>sum</code>, instead trying to access it's index using <code>[..]</code> resulting in <code>TypeError</code>. Also, you are modifying the original list while iterating which will result in different result (which is unexpected result for you). You should be placing these values in separate list.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Multiple issues here. <code>return</code> outside of function, altering the list you're using to sum, square brackets when calling. It might be you're coming from another language? Either way, take a tour of the Python docs (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Tutorial</a>) when you can, it would help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">note that this solution recomputes the sum at each iteration. This should be stored in a variable to avoid that.</span>
