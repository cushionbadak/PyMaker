<p>I have a sentence that I want to parse to check for some conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) If there is a period and it is followed by a whitespace followed by a lowercase letter</p>
<p>b) If there is a period internal to a sequence of letters with no adjacent whitespace (i.e. www.abc.com)</p>
<p>c) If there is a period followed by a whitespace followed by an uppercase letter and preceded by a short list of titles (i.e. Mr., Dr. Mrs.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently I am iterating through the string (line) and using the <em>next()</em> function to see whether the next character is a space or lowercase, etc. And then I just loop through the line. But how would I check to see what the <em>next, next</em> character would be? And how would I find the previous ones?</p>
<pre><code>line = "This is line.1 www.abc.com. Mr."

t = iter(line)
b = next(t)

for i in line[:len(line)-1]:
    a = next(t)
    if i == "." and (a.isdigit()): #for example, this checks to see if the     value after the period is a number
         print("True")
</code></pre>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Regular expressions</strong> is what you want.</p>
<p>Since your going to check for a pattern in a string, you can make use of the python's builtin support for regular expressions through <code>re</code> library.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>#To check if there is a period internal to a sequence of letters with no adjacent whitespace 
import re
str = 'www.google.com'
pattern = '.*\..*'
obj = re.compile(pattern)
if obj.search(str):
    print "Pattern matched"
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly generate patterns for the conditions you want to check in your string.</p>
<pre><code>#If there is a period and it is followed by a whitespace followed by a lowercase letter
regex = '.*\. [a-z].*'
</code></pre>
<p>You can generate and test your regular expressions online using <a href="https://regex101.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> simple tool</p>
<p>Read more extensively about <code>re</code> library <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use multiple next operations to get more data</p>
<pre><code>line = "This is line.1 www.abc.com. Mr."

t = iter(line)
b = next(t)

for i in line[:len(line)-1]:
    a = next(t)
    c = next(t)
    if i == "." and (a.isdigit()): #for example, this checks to see if the     value after the period is a number
         print("True")
</code></pre>
<p>You can get previous ones by saving your iterations to a temporary list</p>

<span class="comment-copy">sounds like you might want to use regex.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd suggest checking out Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regex</a> documentation and an online playground like <a href="https://regex101.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Regex101</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is it possible to still implement it without regex?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but if I add that line then the iterator will advance and the next time I come into the loop it will be further ahead than I want to. Am I correct?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes that is correct, thats why i also suggest saving your iterations in a temporary list</span>
