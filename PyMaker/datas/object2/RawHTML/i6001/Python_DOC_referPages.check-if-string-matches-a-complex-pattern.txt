<p>Thank you for reading my question.</p>
<p>First of all, I use python 3.5 to write my code.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Recently, I have tried to read image file names, and each have a pattern format like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A01_[2016tokyo-tokyo-university-1_chuuoushokudo_1]_ori.jpg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and wordpress will add new post thumbnail for me, like</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A01_[2016tokyo-tokyo-university-1_chuuoushokudo_1]_ori-75x75.jpg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, I use this pattern to rename my images.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(english alphabet)(numbers) _ [(postname) _ (description) _ (number)] _ (ori or mod) _ (number).jpg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My question is, if I want to use this pattern to check whether I use the right way to rename my image, how can I do?</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Try taking a look at Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re module</a>. With a little work, it should help you achieve what you're looking for.</p>
<p>Before using this library, I would advise that you first read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Regular Expression HOWTO</a> article, as it will help you make sense of the <code>re</code> docs.</p>
