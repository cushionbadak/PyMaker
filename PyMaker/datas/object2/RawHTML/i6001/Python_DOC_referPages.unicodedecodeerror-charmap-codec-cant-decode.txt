<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to take the text of a file, each new value on a new line, for example <code>hi /n this is my question /n can u answer it?</code></p>
<p>My_list should look like this <code>My_list[0]</code> should be equal to <code>hi</code>, <code>My_list[1]</code> should be equal to <code>this is my question</code> and <code>My_list[2]</code> should be equal to <code>can u answer it?</code></p>
<p>I tried doing so using the following </p>
<pre><code>with open(r'path.docx',encoding="utf8") as f:
    content = f.readlines()
content = [x.strip() for x in content]
</code></pre>
<p>in an approach like the one i found in here <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3277503/how-do-i-read-a-file-line-by-line-into-I-list">How do I read a file line-by-line into a list?</a><br/>
Then i got a <code>Syntax error for unicode</code> do i referred to this link <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18084554/why-do-i-get-a-syntaxerror-for-a-unicode-escape-in-my-file-path">Why do I get a SyntaxError for a Unicode escape in my file path?</a> added <code>r</code> at first and solved it for the first iteration then got this error </p>
<pre><code>return codecs.charmap_decode(input,self.errors,decoding_table)[0]
UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte X in position Y: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>that i referred to this link to solve <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9233027/unicodedecodeerror-charmap-codec-cant-decode-byte-x-in-position-y-character">UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte X in position Y: character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;</a> and added <code>encoding="utf8"</code>. Still not working .</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I changed the encoding to <code>"Latin-1"</code> but i didn't get the output i want from <code>print (content)</code> instead i got stuff like that <code>['PK\x03\x04\x14\x00\x06\x00\x08\x00\x00\x00!\x00\t$\x87\</code> , again what i want and expect is a list where each line of the .docx file is an element(seperated by /n).</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your input file is a docx file, which is a pkzip compressed archive.</p>
<p>You can't open it as though it is a text file.</p>
<p>Instead you could look at an external package such as <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-docx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python-docx</a>. Something like this might work for you:</p>
<pre><code>import docx

doc = docx.Document('path.docx')
content = [p.text for p in doc.paragraphs]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From the last link you give, I think the problem is that the file you are trying to read is not UTF-8 encoded.  Have you tried with another encoding? There is a list <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Adding <code>encoding="utf-8"</code> only works if your file is actually utf-8 encoded, obviously.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the actual error message when you tried with UTF8? What is the encoding of the file <code>path.docx</code>? Is it UTF8 as you assume? You could check with unix <code>file path.docx</code> command, or by using the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>chardet</code></a> Python package.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried "Latin-1" instead of "utf-8" I didn't get an error but print content basically printed nonsense, I'll update my question to showcase.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is not a text file but a binary file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I used 'pip install docx' then ran the code according to your adjustments and got the following error 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'exceptions'' where this line 'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'exceptions'' exists in 'docx.py'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jimmy: you should <code>pip install python-docx</code>. Uninstall <code>docx</code> first just to make sure that there are no clashes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">May you supply a method to know exactly what encoding the file is so I can check.</span>
