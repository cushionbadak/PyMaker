<p>How do I create a dictionary where every key is a value from a list, and every value is all the values from the list except the key?</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>if I had </p>
<blockquote>
<p>lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>how would I create the dictionary I described using for loops?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>d = {1: [2,3,4,5,6], 2: [1,3,4,5,6], 3: [1,2,4,5,6], 4: [1,2,3,5,6]}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to be able to do this using a for loop, but I don't even know where to start. </p>

<p>This sounds like homework, so I'm only going to give you the outline of a solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an empty dictionary</li>
<li>Loop through the list and add its elements and a copy of the entire list to as the value to the dictionary. Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#copy.deepcopy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>copy.deepcopy</code></a> in the standard library to copy the list.</li>
<li>Loop through the keys and values in your new dictionary and remove the key from the value.</li>
</ol>
<p>Extra credit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictonary comprehension</a>(see towards the bottom of the section) to combine steps 1 and 2.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17246744/2958070">Learn the difference</a> between shallow copies and deep copies. In this specific example, would you have been safe with a shallow copy?</li>
</ul>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do this in one line with a <code>dictionary comprehension</code>:</p>
<pre><code>d = {i:[e for e in lst if e != i] for i in lst}
</code></pre>
<p>which, for your example, gives:</p>
<pre><code>{1: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2: [1, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6], 4: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6], 5: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], 6: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This looks like homework. Please review the guidelines here about posting homework questions <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/334823/4138919">meta.stackoverflow.com/a/334823/4138919</a>. If it is not homework, please make a reasonable attempt and provide an update on what you've tried. A <code>for loop</code> seems like a reasonable place to start. I would review some documentation about Python lists (e.g. <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">developers.google.com/edu/python/lists</a>), dictionaries, and basics of iteration/list enumeration.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is actually cute in Haskell. Haskell uses association lists instead of dictionaries (<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.5.10.2/docs/Data-Map.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">most of the time</a>) which are basically just tuples of <code>(key, value)</code>, so you can do <code>result xs = [(x, filter (/=x) xs) | x &lt;- xs]</code> (where <code>(/=)</code> is the "not equal to" function and ` | x &lt;- xs` is equivalent to <code>for x in xs</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't that break when the list isn't a range of consecutive numbers starting with 0?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ben Yes you are entirely write, there was confusion on my part. I have updated the answer now, and it is actually a shorter expression now!</span>
