<p>i have a csv that is a result of a DB2 query.
For some reason the csv is created like this</p>
<pre><code>"filed1     ", "field2,     ","2017-11-24"
</code></pre>
<p>i'm able to remove the white spaces inside field with this:</p>
<pre><code>for result in results:
    result = [x.strip(' ') for x in result]
    csvwriter.writerow(result)
</code></pre>
<p>but the date field is <code>&lt;type 'datetime.date'&gt;</code> so i get the error</p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: 'datetime.date' object has no attribute 'strip'
</code></pre>
<p>How can i apply the strip function only to string object? Or can i transform the datetime.date object in str object?</p>
<p>Thanks very much</p>

<p>You could change your list comprehension as follows:</p>
<pre><code>result = [str(x).strip() for x in result]
</code></pre>
<p>This will first convert all the cells to a string and then apply the <code>strip()</code> on that. Or more directly as follows:</p>
<pre><code>csvwriter.writerow([str(x).strip() for x in result])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just check the type before:</p>
<pre><code>if isinstance(x,str):
    ...
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks very much! I was doing a stupid error, i was trying with: result = [str(x.strip()) for x in result]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Would recommend adding that <code>isinstance(object, Type)</code> is "standard" in python3 as it checks if an object is a subtype as well (which if you are not checking for, is normally fair to say something is 'wrong' in your design)</span>
