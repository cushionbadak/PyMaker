<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i have a HTML Table with 5 columns. In the third column are links and in the fifth column is a Date.</p>
<p>Now i want to write a code which check if the date is within the next 4 weeks and if yes, then click on the link</p>
<p>This is what i have so far:</p>
<pre><code># Set the Date
start = time.strftime('%d-%m-%Y')
now = datetime.datetime.strptime(start, '%d-%m-%Y')
date_in_four_weeks = now + datetime.timedelta(days=28)
project_time = date_in_four_weeks - now

# Check the date and click on link
for i in range(project_time.days + 1):
    print(now + timedelta(days=i))
    time = driver.find_element_by_css_selector('css_selector')
    if time &lt;= project_time:
        linkList = driver.find_elements_by_css_selector("css_selector")
        for i in range(0,len(linkList)):
            links = driver.find_elements_by_partial_link_text('SOLI')
            links[i].click()
            driver.get_screenshot_as_file("test.png")
    else:
        print "No Project found"
</code></pre>
<p>If i run the code i get the error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: can't compare datetime.timedelta to WebElement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now i want to ask if there is any way how i can fix my problem?</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There's a few issues you have to address.</p>
<p>Firstly, you're comparing to a WebElement object, as the error helpfully points out. This includes the tags and such of the HTML element you're referencing. You first want to extract the text. </p>
<p>Then, you need to parse this text to convert it into a Python <code>datetime</code> or <code>date</code> object. A <code>time</code> object won't do because it only stores time, and not date. Since I don't know what format your HTML date is in, I'll just point you to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a> so you can see how the types work and have some idea of how to parse your data.</p>
<p>Finally, you'd still get an error because of trying to compare a <code>timedelta</code> object to a <code>date</code> or <code>datetime</code> object. A <code>timedelta</code> is a period of time, it doesn't relate to a specific date. </p>
<p>You could fix this by replacing</p>
<p><code>if time &lt;= project_time:</code></p>
<p>With the same as from your print function:</p>
<p><code>if time &lt;= now + timedelta(days=i)</code></p>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the Information, but iÂ´m new to python, how can i do that?</span>
