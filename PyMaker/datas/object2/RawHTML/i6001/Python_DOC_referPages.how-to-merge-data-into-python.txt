<p>how would I  to merge data into python?</p>
<p>I need to merge data based on the date column, where the dates were the same, where I would have as input:</p>
<pre><code>83423;01/06/2006;0000; ;30.5;  ;22.7;53.75;

83423;01/06/2006;1200;0;    ;16;    ;     ;
</code></pre>
<p>and the exit:</p>
<pre><code>83423;01/06/2006;1200;0;30.5;16;22.7;53.75
</code></pre>
<p>How to merge? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>try to understand your question, as far as I can do now...</p>
<pre><code>df = pandas.read_csv('your file name',sep=';', header=None)
df = df.groupby([1]).mean().reset_index()
</code></pre>
<p>then pick the column you need.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I have this entry: 83423; 06/01/2006; 0000; ; 30.5; ; 22.7; 53.75;  83423; 06/01/2006; 1200; 0; ; 16; ; ;  you see, the date is the same on line 1 and 2. And there is a lack of data on line 2, which can be completed with line 1. Where it is with NaN must be filled with the value that is in line 1 or line 2, where the "sum" of the two lines, forms a single. The loopholes that are with NaN can be completed with the data that are in the other line. Understood?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh, sounds df = df.groupby([1]).mean().reset_index() will trickly fit your requirement.</span>
