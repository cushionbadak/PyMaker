<p>The class body executes at class definition time, and that's how the language is designed.  </p>
<p>From section <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-definition-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">9.3.1 Class Definition</a> syntax:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In practice, the statements inside a class definition will usually be function definitions, but other statements are allowed, and sometimes useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is simply how the execution model works in Python, so there's not much more to say about it.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>as per my understanding...anything class can not run until we call it by creating a object</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply a misunderstanding.  This applies for <code>def</code>, i.e. function blocks, but not for class blocks.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It will get a call, as python work like that. 
Your code will always return output.</p>
<p><strong>hello world</strong></p>
<pre><code>class myclass(object):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def myfun(self):
        print("hello world")
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to avoid it you have to add print statement inside the method. </p>
