<p>In the second function, I keep getting a syntax error on the listExpenseNames list. I've tried changing the name of the variable to ExpenseNamesList, but I got the same error. For both these variable names I also tested with 0 as the index, but that also made no difference. Any help would be appreciated. Also, please don't try to correct any other errors there may be in my code, I want to learn through making mistakes myself. (This may seem contradictory because I just posted asking for a fix, but that's only because I'm stumped and it's preventing me from moving on.)</p>
<pre><code>def inputExpenseNames():
    listExpenseNames =[]
    loopExpenseNames = y
    while loopExpenseNames == y:
        listExpenseNames.append = input('Please enter the expense name.')
        loopExpenseNames=input('Would you like to enter another expense? If so, please enter \'y\'')
    print(listExpenseNames)

def inputExpenseAmounts():
    listExpenseAmounts =[]
    loopExpenseAmounts = 0
    while loopExpenseAmounts &lt;= len(inputExpenseNames) :
        listExpenseAmounts.append = input('How much was spent on' listExpenseNames[int(loopExpenseAmounts)]'?')
        loopExpenseAmounts += 1
    print(listExpenseAmounts)

<p>This code has a couple of problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>listExpenseNames</code> will not be defined inside <code>inputExpenseAmounts</code>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces" rel="nofollow noreferrer">See Here</a> for an explanation</li>
<li><code>l.append = ...</code> will change the value of the <code>append</code> attribute, it won't actually append anything.  To append something do <code>l.append(...)</code></li>
<li>As others have pointed out, use <code>+</code> to concatenate strings: <code>'spent on' +  listExpenseNames[int(loopExpenseAmounts)] + '?'</code></li>
</ol>
<p>` </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I assume you want to print the string stored in listExpenseNames[int(loopExpenseAmounts)] for the input display text. You need to concatenate the strings with a + to one string and not only list them after each other:</p>
<pre><code>listExpenseAmounts.append = input('How much was spent on' + listExpenseNames[int(loopExpenseAmounts)] + '?')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are trying to concatenate strings on the following line but you are not. try the following code instead.</p>
<pre><code>listExpenseAmounts.append(input('How much was spent on'+ listExpenseNames[int(loopExpenseAmounts)]'?'))

<span class="comment-copy">You should add the error message</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Definity, the expression <code>input('How much was spent on' listExpenseNames[int(loopExpenseAmounts)]'?')</code> causes an error! Replace it with <code>input('How much was spent on' +str(listExpenseNames[int(loopExpenseAmounts)]) + '?')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">First things first <code>.append</code> is a method it needs to look like this: <code>.append()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>input('How much was spent on' listExpenseNames[int(loopExpenseAmounts)]'?')</code> you need to concatenate with a <code>+</code> here.</span>
