<p>My code does the following, It reads a N*N matrix file e.g. my matrix.txt file is </p>
<p>2 3 4</p>
<p>1 2 6</p>
<p>9 8 9</p>
<p>and converts it into a list integer [[2,3,4],[1,2,6],[9,8,9]] </p>
<p>which
then transposes the values inside by moving the value inside to the value of the index when flipped. E.g. [1][0] = 1, so the value of list [0][1] should change from 3 to 1. and the value of [1][0] changes from 1 to 3.</p>
<p>This makes it so the final output after transposing the matrix should become</p>
<p>[[2,1,9],[3,2,8],[4,6,9]] after flipping all values. </p>
<p>Keep in mind if the index is same where [0][0] or [1][1] or [2][2], nothing happens.</p>
<p>The following is my code, i am unable to get the final output as i think there there is something wrong with my swapping algorithm, any help is appreciated.</p>
<pre><code>file =(input("Enter the filename: "))

f = open(file)
matrix = []



for line in f:
    line = line.strip()
    line = line.split()

    if line:
        for x in range(len(line)):

            line[x] = int(line[x])

        matrix.append(line)

transpose = []

for x in range(len(matrix)):
    transpose.append([])
    bob = transpose[x]



    for y in range(len(bob)):
        temp = 0
        temp = matrix[x][bob[y]] 
        matrix[x][bob[y]] = matrix[y][bob[x]]
        matrix[y][bob[x]] = temp




print(matrix)
print(transpose)

<p>FYI, this could be replaced by a <code>zip()</code> function pretty easily.  Passing in 3 separate arrays (list[0], list[1], list[2]) and zipping them will basically realign the elements by column.  So [[2 3 4], [1 2 6], [9 8 9]] becomes [[2 1 9], [3 2 8], [4 6 9]].</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lista = [2,3,4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; listb = [1,2,6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; listc = [9,8,9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; new = zip(lista, listb, listc)

&gt;&gt;&gt; for row in new:
...     print(row)

(2, 1, 9)
(3, 2, 8)
(4, 6, 9)

<span class="comment-copy">What is the question? Does your code work? what does/doesn't it do that is incorrect?  What is the expected output for the example input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">“So the value of list [0][1] should change from 2 to 1”: isn’t it from 3 to 1?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes ur right, it should change from 3 to 1, slight typo sorry about that. And my question is how to fix the swapping algorithm as i am unable to get the final output</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the expected output from the example input should be [[2,1,9],[3,2,8],[4,6,9]]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">may you explain what the function zip() does and what *matrix does for the zip function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I included a link to <code>zip</code>'s documentation in my post.  <code>matrix</code> is the list of lists that you constructed from the file in your example. the <code>*</code> unpacks the <i>sub</i>-lists from <code>matrix</code>.</span>
