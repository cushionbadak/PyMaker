<p>I'm learning python and also english. And I have a problem that might be easy, but I can't solve it. I have a folder of .txt's, I was able to extract by regular expression a sequence of 17 numbers of each one.I need to rename each file with the sequence I extracted from .txt</p>
<pre><code>import os
import re

path_txt = (r'C:\Users\usuario\Desktop\files')


name_files = os.listdir(path_txt)


for TXT in name_files:
    with open(path_txt + '\\' + TXT, "r") as content:
        search = re.search(r'(\d{5}\.?\d{4}\.?\d{3}\.?\d{2}\.?\d{2}\-?\d)', content.read())
        if search is not None:
            print(search.group(0))
            f = open(os.path.join( "Processes" , search.group(0) + ".txt"), "w")
        for line in content:
            print(line)
            f.write(line)
            f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>there are .txt where the sequences appear with spaces between characters, and my regular expression can not find them (example: 00372.2004 .442.02.00-1, 00572.2008.872.02.00- 5)</p>
<p>edit: They are serial numbers, were typed, so sometimes they appear with "." and "-" and other times without them. Sometimes spaces appear because of typos.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You want this regex:</p>
<pre><code>   search = re.search(r'(\d{5}.*\d{4}.*\d{3}.*\d{2}.*\d{2}-.*\d)', content.read())
</code></pre>
<p>Dot . is any character. By putting \ in front of the dot you escaped it and searched for dots and not any character. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>\D</code> in your regular expression to match any non-numeric character (including white space) and <code>+</code> to match one or more (or <code>*</code> to match zero or more), so you could rewrite your expression as:</p>
<pre><code>pattern = r'(\d{5}\D+\d{4}\D+\d{3}\D+\d{2}\D+\d{2}\D+\d)'
re.findall(pattern, '00372.2004 .442.02.00-1, 00572.2008.872.02.00- 5')
# ['00372.2004 .442.02.00-1', '00572.2008.872.02.00- 5']
</code></pre>
<p>Note I am using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.findall</code></a> to find every match in the string and return them in a list.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Your regular expression only accepts digits <code>\d</code>, periods <code>\.</code> and a minus sign, so it is no wonder it doesn't accept a string with a white space in it.  A whitespace is written <code>\w</code>, or just as a regular space if you know that is what you have.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does it work when the sequences appear concatenated?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. Because the * means any character can occur 0 until unlimited times...</span>
