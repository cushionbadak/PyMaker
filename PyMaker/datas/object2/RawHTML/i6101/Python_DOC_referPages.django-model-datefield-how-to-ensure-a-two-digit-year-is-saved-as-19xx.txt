<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a form that takes a user's birthdate. By default, Django accepts three input formats for dates, including MM/DD/YY. However if I enter something like 02/13/45, it saves as 02/13/2045. I've looked through the places I expected to find some threads in the docs but still nothing. Can someone push me in the right direction?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>DateField just <a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.11.x/django/forms/fields.py#L435" rel="nofollow noreferrer">uses the <code>datetime.strptime</code> method</a>, which in turn uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the underlying C <code>strftime</code> implementation</a>; there's no way to change the way it parses a two-digit year. As mentioned in the comment, probably the best way to do this is to check if it's in the future, then subtract 100.</p>
<pre><code>def clean_birthdate(self):
    birthdate = self.cleaned_data('birthdate')
    if birthdate &gt; datetime.datetime.today():
        birthdate = birthdate.replace(year=(birthdate.year-100))
    return birthdate
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Could it be as simple as checking the input, and if the year is in the future, subtract 1000? Been a bit since i've messed with django forms</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SuperStew Here I was wondering why I can't find a dozen threads answering this very obvious, common problem...thanks, I'll try this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I tried this and am getting <code>TypeError: unorderable types</code>. Could this be because at this point in the process <code>birthdate</code> is still a string and hasn't been converted to a date object yet?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show the full error? The point of <code>cleaned_data</code> is that it should contain data that is already cleaned, ie converted to the correct type, hence the name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure, here's the error: <a href="https://pastebin.com/7S8ueXTE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pastebin.com/7S8ueXTE</a>  And my code: <a href="https://pastebin.com/aVssUfE0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pastebin.com/aVssUfE0</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay I got it to work; I think I was implementing your solution incorrectly/somehow failing to make it conform to my project's needs. I also get confused around whether to include parentheses when working with <code>date</code> and <code>datetime</code> objects so I had to monkey with that a bit. Here's what finally worked: <a href="https://pastebin.com/L9nZzwms" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pastebin.com/L9nZzwms</a>  Thank you so much!!</span>
