<p>This snippet worked fine</p>
<pre><code>if True: print "just True"
if (True): print "(True)"

<p>Was studying loops and these worked fine</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(1, 3):
    print i

i = 0
while i &lt; 3: # without paranthesis
    print i
    i = i + 1

i = 0
while (i &lt; 3): # with paranthesis
    print i
    i = i + 1
</code></pre>
<p>When I tried</p>
<pre><code>for (i in range(1, 3)):
    print i
</code></pre>
<p>I get an error "SyntaxError: invalid syntax"</p>
<p>I do understand the outside parenthesis is making for loop go crazy (error) but <strong>which part of the syntax am I violating</strong>? it worked fine in while loop</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>syntax of <code>for</code> is (simplified)</p>
<pre><code>for &lt;variable(s)&gt; in &lt;expression&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for" rel="nofollow noreferrer">more precisely</a>:</p>
<pre><code>for_stmt ::=  "for" target_list "in" expression_list ":" suite
              ["else" ":" suite]
</code></pre>
<p>since you're parenthesizing <code>&lt;variable&gt; in &lt;expression&gt;</code>, the syntax becomes invalid.</p>
<p><code>for</code> and <code>in</code> must be present at the same nesting level.</p>
<p>syntax of <code>while</code> is much <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#while" rel="nofollow noreferrer">simpler</a>:</p>
<pre><code>while_stmt ::=  "while" expression ":" suite
                ["else" ":" suite]
</code></pre>
<p>thus allows parentheses, although not necessary in Python</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can't just lob on extra parenthesis anywhere you want. The <code>while</code> syntax, generally stated, is:</p>
<pre><code>while &lt;condition&gt;:
</code></pre>
<p>Here, you're just surrounding a condition with parenthesis, which is fine, as you saw yourself.  The <code>for</code> loop's syntax is:</p>
<pre><code>for &lt;variable&gt; in &lt;expression&gt;:
</code></pre>
<p>You could surround the <code>expression</code> in parenthesis, but no arbitrary parts of the syntax.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">One is a loop while the other is a True/False statement?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>(i &lt; 3)</code> is an expression, so you can add as many redundant parentheses as you like.  But if you want to add parentheses to a <code>for</code> statement, you have to add them to the expression, e.g. <code>for i in (range(1, 3))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AntonvBR That doesn't have anything to do with it.  The problem is that parentheses were inserted outside of an expression.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">blame <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">java for</a> it confused me hehe</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh yes i understand now. thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">compare of while and for really helped, thanks</span>
