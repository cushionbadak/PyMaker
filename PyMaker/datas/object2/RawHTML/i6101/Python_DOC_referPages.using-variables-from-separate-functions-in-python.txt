<p>I am currently working on a coding project where I have set several functions. I am trying to figure out how to use variables from different function. I have tried using 'self' but it hasn't worked. Can anyone help me sort out my code? </p>
<pre><code>class A(object):

    def intro1(self):
        print("Welcome to the XXCI forum!")
        self.intro2()

    def intro2(self):
        print("Press 'L' to log in and 'S to sign up.")
        ch1 = input()
        if ch1 == 'l' or 'L':
        self.log_in()
        elif ch1 == 'S' or 's':
        self.sign_up1()
        else:
        print("Your input was invalid")
        self.intro2()

    def sign_up1(self):
        print("Please enter your first name:")
        fn1 = input()
        if len(fn1) &gt;= 3:
            self.sign_up2()
        elif len(fn1) &lt;3:
            print("Please enter a name that is equal to or over three characters!")
            self.sign_up1()

    def sign_up2(self):
        print("Please enter your last name.")
        ln1 = input()
        if ln1 == ln1:
            with open(ln1.txt, "a") as ln1:
                ln1.write("Age: " + ag1 + ".")
                sign_up3()

    def sign_up3():
        print("Please enter your age.")
        ag1 = input()
        if ag1 &gt; 90:
            print("Please enter an age under 90 and equal to 16 or over.")
        elif ag1 &lt;16:
            print("Please enter an age under 90 and equal to 16 or over.")
        else:
            user_g()

        def user_g():
            username = (fn1[3], str[ag1])
            username.join''
            print("Here is your username:")
            print(username)
            p_creator()

<p>It's obviously not finished yet, but I would really appreciate guidance with how to correct my errors and use variables in different functions. Thank you very much!!</p>

<p>you can find everything in the Python documentation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html?highlight=class%20attributes%20access#class-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html?highlight=class%20attributes%20access#class-objects</a> 
So you need just create and then call class's attributes.</p>
<p>Also you could use the best python practice DRY (don't repeat yourself) and merge two 'if' statements in def sign_up3 like this: 'if ag1 &gt; 90 and ag1 &lt; 16' (another and shorter way is 'if 16 &lt; ag1 &lt; 90')</p>
<p>Hope it helped anyhow.
best regards and good luck.</p>
<p>P.S.: please, use the indentations.</p>

<p>You can use global variable. Assign the variable outside the function. Then inside the function called the variable with global in front of it. For example:</p>
<pre><code>def f():
    global s
    print(s)

s = "Demo of global variable" 
f()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This shouldn't even be a class, nor use recursion to implement simple iteration. This entire thing should be rewritten as a <i>single</i> function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">BTW, <code>ch1 == 'l' or 'L'</code> doesn't do what you think it does. It's equivalent to <code>(ch1 == 'l') or 'L'</code>. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20002503/why-does-a-b-or-c-or-d-always-evaluate-to-true" title="why does a b or c or d always evaluate to true">stackoverflow.com/questions/20002503/…</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15112125/how-do-i-test-one-variable-against-multiple-values" title="how do i test one variable against multiple values">stackoverflow.com/questions/15112125/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to SO. Unfortunately this isn't a discussion forum, or tutorial. Please take the time to read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a> and the links it contains.  You should spend some time working your way through <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Tutorial</a>, practicing the examples. It will give you an introduction to the tools Python has to offer and you may even start to get ideas for solving your problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, why do <code>elif len(fn1) &lt;3</code>. You just tested <code>if len(fn1) &gt;= 3</code>, so if that's false then <code>len(fn1) &lt;3</code> <i>must</i> be true. And <code>username.join''</code> is wrong, I suspect you meant <code>''.join(username)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The way to use variables from one function in another function is to <i>pass all the data you need as function arguments</i>. It's good practice to keep functions pure and avoid side effects.</span>
