<p>I don't know why I  get this error when I try to test this function. Can anyone please help me fix this?</p>

<p>I want my end result to look like this.

<p>You can't use a list as a dictionary key. The type you use as a key needs to be hashable (this is what the <code>TypeError: unhashable type</code> refers to.</p>
<p>Instead of using a list, you'll need to sort and group your files by <em>single</em> keywords, and use those as the keys - this has the added benefit of being able to search the list by a single keyword, instead of requiring you to have all the keywords for a file to be able to find it. Something like this would work:</p>
<pre><code>for line in open_file:
    new_d = line.split(',')
    filename = new_d[0]
    keywords = new_d[5:]
    for keyword in keywords:
        if keyword not in d:
            d[keyword] = [filename]
        else:
            d[keyword].append(filename)

<span class="comment-copy">You're trying to use a <code>list</code> as dictionary key, which doesn't work. Also, you should use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code> module</a> in the standard library to read/parse CSV files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what does the last line mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_append.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list.append</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">But d[keyword] is still a key, so isn't it a dict?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, <code>d[keyword]</code> is a list. This loops over every keyword in the file's keywords list. If they're not already in <code>d</code>, it adds a list under <code>d[keyword]</code> containing the filename. If they're already there, it adds the filename to the existing list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh ok, I see, thanks</span>
