<p><code>x=array(x)</code> is not working in python. 
It shows array is not defined.</p>

<p><code>array</code> is a module in the standard library, you must import it before you can use it.</p>
<pre><code>from array import array
x = 1, 2, 3
x = array('i', x)
x
</code></pre>
<h3>output:</h3>
<pre><code>array('i', [1, 2, 3])
</code></pre>
<p>Please read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>, arrays require to declare the type of objects it contains.</p>
<h3>alternative 1: use list</h3>
<p>In your case, you may want to use list instead. lists are collections of objects that can be of any type:</p>
<pre><code>x = [1, 2, 3]   # list of integers
x = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]   # list of lists of integers
x = ['a', 1, 3.14]  # list of various objects
</code></pre>
<h3>alternative 2: use numpy array</h3>
<p>numpy is an external library that must be installed separately.</p>
<pre><code>import numpy
x = numpy.array([1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>Firstly, as stated in the comments by <em>abccd</em>, python has <code>list</code> not <code>array</code> by default.
So, you'll be getting an error like
 <code>name array was not defined</code></p>
<p>But if you are planning to use <code>array</code> then I guess what you are trying to do is use numpy.array</p>
<p>Here is the code that you want:</p>
<pre><code>from numpy import array
x = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
x = array(x)
</code></pre>
<p>This will store a <code>numpy array</code> in x, which will let you handle it in an easier way than the usual lists.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Python has <code>list</code> not <code>array</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you expect <code>array</code> to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I expect this to work <code>x=array(x)</code> @juanpa.arrivillaga</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I read the documentation. I need to import an array module from python library. I have a problem with 2D arrays.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great, glad I could help. Please see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/someone-answers">stackoverflow.com/help/someone-answers</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your help. This code worked for me <code>from array import array x = 1, 2, 3 x = array('i', x) x</code> But what if I want to use x as nested arrays.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not the surrounding brackets in <code>x</code> - you are first defining a List of Lists.  Then <code>numpy.array</code> converts that LoL into an array.  One difference between lists &amp; arrays is that lists can hold any type of object, while I believe arrays can hold only numbers.  In addition, numpy arrays can do array math between arrays (eg. <code>array1 * array2</code>), while lists must be iterated to do the same thing (eg. <code>for x in MyList: ...</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. You are correct.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python does have arrays. It stores the array as an object. I have asked the question how to use it using python array, not numpy one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe what you want to say is a 'list', not an 'array'</span>
