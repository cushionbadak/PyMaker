<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If I create a folder in a root directory, where the folder name is generated by a script.py giving it a name with todays date(YYYY-mm-dd). how do I reference that folder from another script (or the same script at a later stage) in the same directory after it's creation? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are several options: </p>
<ol>
<li>Use today's date to construct the same name in the other script</li>
<li>Have the scripts share a common parent environment or calling script that passes the name to both scripts</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">interprocess communication</a> between the scripts</li>
<li>Have the scripts read the filename from a common location (e.g. a file known to both scripts)</li>
</ol>

<span class="comment-copy">...You use today's date to reference it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Huh? Put the folder name into a variable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you trying to automatically detect new folders being created? If so, take a look <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/597903/monitoring-contents-of-files-directories">here</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rawing "today's date" might change during execution. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your help. Option 1 seems to be the easiest solution for what I'm trying to accomplish.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, but it only works on the same day, and there is a race condition :-)</span>
