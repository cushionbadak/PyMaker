<p>Instead of storing into arrays in the first place and then manipulating, you can store straight into dictionaries!</p>
<p>For instance,</p>
<p><code>first_user = { 'username' : "ErikMendez", 'password' : "Mendez1995", 'balance' : 100.0 }</code></p>
<p>Afterwards, you can access the dictionary by key values. For example, <code>first_user['username']</code> returns the string <code>ErikMendez</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to create and access a list containing these bindings, you could do this:</p>
<pre><code>list = []
first_user = { 'username' : "ErikMendez", 'password' : "Mendez1995" }
list.append(first_user)
print(list[0]['username']) # prints ErikMendez
print(list[0]['password']) # prints Mendez1995
</code></pre>
<h1>Edit:</h1>
<p>Based on Blckknght's suggestion, here's something even better you can do: since dictionaries are based on <code>'key' : 'value'</code> pairs, you could use <code>username</code>'s as keys and use another dictionary as <code>value</code>s to store the info! For instance:</p>
<pre><code>user_dictionary = { 
    'ErikMendez' : { 'password' : "Mendez1995", 'balance' : 100.0 }, 
    'Reinhardt' : { 'password' : "Honor&amp;Glory", 'balance' : 500.0 } 
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can access this dictionary using</p>
<pre><code>print(user_dictionary['ErikMendez']) # prints { 'password' : "Mendez1995", 'balance' : 100.0 }
print(user_dictionary['ErikMendez']['password']) # prints Mendez1995
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">use a <code>dict</code>? ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While your main point (use dictionaries!) is a good one, I think you've missed a major advantage of dicts: It's very efficient to look up a value in a dictionary when you know the key. So rather than creating one dict per user, and then putting all the dicts in a list, I'd suggest using the usernames as the keys in a large dict that contains data on all the bank's users. You'd could either have separate dictionaries for the passwords and the balances, or a single dict with mapping from user names to combined <code>password, balance</code> values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good point, I forgot about that! Plus, I wanted to answer the specific question: how to bind a username and password. I'll edit my answer to provide your better solution. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">These are great suggestions. Thanks for the help.</span>
