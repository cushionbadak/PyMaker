<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to make a SQL database in python that stores users names and birthdays. At the moment I have this code;</p>
<pre><code>sql_command = ("""INSERT INTO birthdays(name, birthday) VALUES (%s,%s);""", (name, birthday))
cursor.execute(*sql_command)
</code></pre>
<p>But when I enter it, it gives me an error message. I have already created the database with the appropriate name and columns and I have defined the name and birthday variable. I am using SQLite 3. Any suggestions that anybody has would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>You're trying to use normal string interpolation instead of param substitution. Change <code>%s</code> to <code>?</code> as shown in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.execute" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have changed the %s to ? and it now works perfectly. This is the code I used;</p>
<p><strong>sql_command = ("""INSERT INTO birthdays(name, birthday) VALUES (?,?);""", (name, birthday))
cursor.execute(*sql_command)</strong></p>
</div>
