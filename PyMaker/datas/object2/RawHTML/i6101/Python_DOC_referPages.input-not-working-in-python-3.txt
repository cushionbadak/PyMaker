<p>I have been given an assignment by my teacher in class to write a Python program that calculates the circumference and area of certain shapes. So far my first bit of code</p>
<pre><code>import math

print ('Circumference and Area calculator')
def loop():
    again = input ('Would you like to make any more calculations? (y/n)').lower()
    if again == "y":
        choice()
    elif again == "n":
            print ('\nGoodbye')
    else:
            print ('Please enter y for yes and n for no')
            print ('Try again')
            loop()
</code></pre>
<p>But when I run this module in the Python IDLE the input does not show up, and it just prints "Circumference and Area calculator". After removing <code>def loop():</code> the input works, but with it it doesn't.</p>
<p>Would any one be able to give a solution or send me on the right path?</p>

<p>You've defined the function loop() but you never call it. You'll want something like this at the end of the file:</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop()
</code></pre>

<p>You need to call <code>loop</code> function
Try this:</p>
<pre><code>import math

print ('Circumference and Area calculator')
def loop():

<span class="comment-copy">Did you call <code>loop</code> function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You never invoke the function loop()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I like how this has an attempt to solve the problem, shows some level of understanding of <code>python</code> and requests for <code>the right path</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't use recursion where a <code>while</code> loop would work perfectly well.</span>
