<pre><code>list1 = [['hello',3],['bye',4].....]
</code></pre>
<p>I need to find just the sum of the numbers, 3 + 4 = 7 in this case, for an undefined number of item in the list all structured like this</p>
<p>I don't know how to call a spisific element from the sublists from every sublist for a sum command. I have tryed the following but what do I put in the first brackets? Or is there a better way to write this?</p>
<pre><code>sum(list1[][1])
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>For a simple two dimensional list, you can try this:</p>
<pre><code>list1 = [['hello',3],['bye',4]]
the_sum = sum(i[-1] for i in list1)
</code></pre>
<p>However, for a list of <code>n</code> dimensions, recursion is best:</p>
<pre><code>list1 = [['hello',3],['bye',4], [["hi", 19], ["yes", 18]]]

def flatten(s):
   if not isinstance(s, list):
       yield s
   else:
       for i in s:
          for b in flatten(i):
              yield b

final_result = sum(filter(lambda x:isinstance(x, int), list(flatten(list1))))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>44
</code></pre>
