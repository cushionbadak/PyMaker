<p>I am trying to get a input to be typed after the "Choice: " but i also want to continue "*" around the whole text... Im  not sure how to do it even after trying multiple times with variations and research i couldn't dind an answer...</p>
<pre><code>print("  ********School Quizes********  ")
print("  *                           *  ")
print("  *       A) Register         *  ")
print("  *       B) Loging           *  ")
print("  *       C) Quit             *  ")
print("  *                           *  ")
input("  *                Choice: ") &amp; print(" *  ")
</code></pre>
<p>so that it is printed with "Choice:(here will be the input) * "</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Technically, you could just do this:</p>
<pre><code>print("  ********School Quizes********  ")
print("  *                           *  ")
print("  *       A) Register         *  ")
print("  *       B) Loging           *  ")
print("  *       C) Quit             *  ")
print("  *                           *  ")
input("  *       Choice:             *  ")
</code></pre>
<p>All the text in the quotation marks do is that it just acts as text to be prompted, which is why this works.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I can do it this way. But I feel this is really a hack...</p>
<pre><code>x = input('''
  ********School Quizes********  
  *                           *  
  *       A) Register         *  
  *       B) Loging           *  
  *       C) Quit             *  
  *                           *  
                              *\r  *             Choice:    ''')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">even if i do this when inputing it will be like so, " *       Choice:             * (input will go here)  " but i want it like this "*       Choice:(input here)             * "</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this has not worked at all... in fact please test codes before hand next time, im always thankful for the support and help though!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i did test it using the python interpreter of jupyter notebook's terminal. that's a unix environment.</span>
