<p>I am wondering how to compare the entry into a tkinter window to data in a sqlite3 table. I am able to read from the table but when compared to an "Entry" it never comes out as if the entry has been found. </p>
<pre><code>def __init__(self, master):
self.frame = Frame(master)
self.frame.pack()
self.firstname = StringVar()
self.surname = StringVar()

 def find(self):
    x = c.execute('SELECT surname FROM MemberRecordsTable')
    if self.surname.get() == x:
        found = Label(self.frame, text = 'Name found')
        found.pack()
    else:
        notfound = Label(self.frame, text = 'Name not found')
        notfound.pack()

def checkpayments(self):
    checkmember = Entry(self.frame, textvariable = self.surname)
    checkmember.pack()
    checkmember2 = Entry(self.frame, textvariable = self.firstname)
    checkmember2.pack()
    findmember = Button(self.frame, text = 'Find member', command = self.find)
    findmember.pack()
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Connection.execute" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>cursor.execute()</code></a> returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sqlite3.Cursor</code></a> object. You then need to use that cursor to get the actual query results. You could do that with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3.Cursor.fetchone" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>cursor.fetchone()</code></a> to grab the first result.</p>
<p>However, since you want to check if there are any rows in the database containing the value of <code>self.surname</code> in the surname column you can query like this:</p>
<pre><code>c.execute('SELECT surname FROM MemberRecordsTable where surname = ?', (self.surname.get(),))
if c.fetchone():
    print('Found')
else:
    print('Not found')
</code></pre>
<p>This query will return rows from the database having the value of <code>self.surname</code> in the <code>surname</code> column. The query is performed using parametrisation to mitigate against SQL injection attacks which are present when accepting arbitrary user entered data.</p>
