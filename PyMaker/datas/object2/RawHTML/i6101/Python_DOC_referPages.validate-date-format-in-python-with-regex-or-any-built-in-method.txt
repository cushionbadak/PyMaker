<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am having the python code that needs to validate the following date format:</p>
<p><strong>YYYYMMDD</strong></p>
<p>Above format does not contain any special characters like [:,-,/].</p>
<p>I have mentioned example like : </p>
<p><strong>20170922</strong></p>
<p>We need to validate that above is valid date format by following YYYYMMDD format.</p>
<p>if it's not, then it should raise some sort of error. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can use datetime for this (in python 2.7)</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime

date_string = '20170808'

if len(date_string) == 8:
   datetime.strptime(date_string, '%Y%m%d')
else:
   raise ValueError('date need to be in format YYYYMMDD ')
</code></pre>
<p>if you date is not valid than you get:</p>
<p>a ValueError Exception</p>
<pre><code>ValueError: unconverted data remains: 0
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Okay, you have our permission to do so.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Regex is not the right tool for this job. You can use regex to check if the input is exactly 8 digits, but any further validation should be done by a dedicated date/time library.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah. I have seen some date/time methods like datetime.datetime() needs some date formats having special characters like YYYY-MM-DD or Y-M-D or Y/M/D. But in my case I dont want to use any special character in between to validate date format.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you read the link wim included? You can construct your own format from the information there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah it is working fine except one scenario like Instead of 20170909, I declared 201799 is also it is taking as correct format which is wrong case for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Any extension to above code to resolve this issue</span>
<span class="comment-copy">added an if len(date_string) == 8 for a case like 201799</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah its working fine. Thanks</span>
