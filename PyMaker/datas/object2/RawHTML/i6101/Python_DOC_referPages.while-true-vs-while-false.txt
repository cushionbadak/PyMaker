<p>I understand that the following is an infinite loop (until you break out of it):</p>
<pre><code>while True:
</code></pre>
<p>So then, what would be the need to ever use the following:</p>
<pre><code>while False:
</code></pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre><code>while not True:
</code></pre>
<p>Since the while loop only executes the code below if the while (condition):
evaluates to the boolean True, is it correct to assume that the "code" show below would never execute?:</p>
<pre><code>while False:
    code
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>while</code> only executes the loop body if the expression evaluates to a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing" rel="noreferrer">true value</a>.</p>
<p>As such, hardcoding the expression to <code>False</code> (or anything that always produces <code>False</code> or other false value), has no use other than to ensure the loop block is not executed.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There is <i>no use</i> in a <code>while</code> loop with a hardcoded <code>False</code> result.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could use <code>while False:</code> during development to temporarily eliminate a block of code. I find it easier to just comment it out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If this is used, then it is 'nice' to precede the area with a comment indicating why it is blocked.  (ie "Code blocked to try something else instead, leave here so the compiler checks the code - or remove completely when ready")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which can be useful when testing blocks of code...Use while (false) to block some code while you try another....Its a bit better than commenting the code out as the compiler will still verify the code (If that 'feature' is helpful...It depends on the coder, team, etc)</span>
