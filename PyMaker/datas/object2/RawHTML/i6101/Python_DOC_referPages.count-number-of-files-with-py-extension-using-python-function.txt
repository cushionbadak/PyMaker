<p>I am quite new to python and i am trying to figure out the way we can write a function which can compute the number of python files(.py extension) in a specified directory recursively.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Why do you want to do that?
You could just do
 <code>find -iregex .*.py</code>
on any linux box.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could import walk from os and use it to walk a directory and check the last 3 characters of each file name.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pathlib</code></a> module. There's an example that almost does what you want in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#basic-use" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Basic use</a> section.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>os</code> is old-school. All the cool kids use <code>pathlib</code>. ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because i don't have one.</span>
