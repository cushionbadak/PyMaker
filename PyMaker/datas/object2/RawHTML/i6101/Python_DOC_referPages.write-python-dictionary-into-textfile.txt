<p>I want to write my python dictionary in a text file where each line contain one key and its value, with comma as separation. I am using the following code:</p>
<pre><code>with open(compounds, 'w') as f:
    for key, value in dict_NTID_IDs_in_EisDatabase.items():
        f.write('%s:%s\n' % (key, value))
</code></pre>
<p>But it returns me the following error TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not list</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is that compounds, where you initialize it, cannot be interpreted as a file path because it's a list.
Put this before that code:</p>
<p><code>compounds = "my_dict.txt"</code></p>
<p>This will write your dictionary in a file in the directory you're in. You can check the directory you're in, or change it with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os</a> package.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I hope it will help you!</p>
<pre><code>dic = {'Python' : '.py', 'C++' : '.cpp', 'Java' : '.java'}
f = open("dic.txt","w")
f.write( str(dic) )
f.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It should work with this :</p>
<pre><code>with open(compounds, 'w') as f:
    for key, value in zip(dict_NTID_IDs_in_EisDatabase.keys(), dict_NTID_IDs_in_EisDatabase.values()):
        f.write('%s,%s\n' % (key, value))
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <code>dict.items()</code> as you mentionned but <code>dict.items()</code> returns a <code>tuple</code> <code>((key0, value0), (key1, value1) ...)</code>.</p>
<p>To get back to your question, you can use :</p>
<pre><code>with open(compounds, 'w') as f:
    for item in dict_NTID_IDs_in_EisDatabase.items():
        f.write('%s,%s\n' % (item[0], item[1]))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks like <code>compounds</code> is a list. Use a string instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no, compounds is a textfile</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since an os.PathLike object is expected, this suggests the exception comes from open(). What's the type of 'compounds'?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@smvpfm, you're using a <code>:</code> as a separator. What does key/value look like in <code>dict_NTID_IDs_in_EisDatabase</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I get this error expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I changed the name of the file and now it works, thanks!</span>
