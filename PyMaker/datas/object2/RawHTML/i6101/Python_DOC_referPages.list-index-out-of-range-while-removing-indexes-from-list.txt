<p>You are modifying a list while iterating over it. Because of that, the list is changing in size while you are iterating cause an index out of bounds. </p>
<p>What you could do is create another list from the elements you don't want to remove.</p>
<pre><code>new_list = [x for x in mylist if not remove(x)]
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to keep the same list and not create a new copy then you could use the slice operator.</p>
<pre><code>mylist[:] = [x for x in mylist if not remove(x)]   
</code></pre>
<p>The itertools library also provides a tool to do this called filterfalse
