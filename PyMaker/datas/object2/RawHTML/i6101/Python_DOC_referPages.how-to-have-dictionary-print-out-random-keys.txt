<p>Hi, I am trying to create a vocabulary test on python, but when I run the code, instead of printing out the key, it just prints out "None" 
What can I do for the code to print out a random key?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use random.choice instead of shuffle.</p>
<pre><code>choice = random.choice(list(dictionary.keys()))
</code></pre>
<p>shuffle changes the list you send into the function and since you don't save a reference to that list, you don't get anything. Also, it only generates a shuffled version of that list and not a single value.</p>
<pre><code>alist = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
random.shuffle(alist)
print(alist)

&gt;&gt; [2, 5, 6, 4, 3, 1]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.sample</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">try some print statement at various points and see from where your dict is changing and not storing values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>random.shuffle</code> works in-place and returns <code>None</code>, like <code>my_list.append(x)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Even better, drop the <code>list</code>, since <code>.keys()</code> returns a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bozdoz not on Python 3 it doesn't</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow, didn't know.  Thanks, @juanpa.arrivillaga. What an interesting jump it will be when I finally start using version 3. :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Although, you <i>don't</i> need to call <code>keys</code> at all. Just <code>list(dictionary)</code> will give you a list of keys.</span>
