<p>Is it possible to manipulate a variable, for example:<br/>
<code>file = "/Python/work.txt"</code>
<br/>to just list work.txt, without /Python? excluding everything on the left of the "/"?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Of course! Simply do this:</p>
<pre><code>file = "/Python/work.txt"
excluded = file.split("/")[-1]
</code></pre>
<p>This would return "work.txt" in the excluded variable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">BTW, that's not valid Python syntax: you forgot the quotes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since you're using Python 3, I recommend that you become familiar with the awesome <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pathlib</code></a> module, which is very handy for all sorts of path manipulation tasks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No. Use the <code>os</code> module. The code won't be portable if you hardcode the separator.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's a good idea to do a search for duplicates when you see a question that's probably been asked before.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@timgeb <code>os</code> is old-school. All the cool kids use <code>pathlib</code>. ;)</span>
