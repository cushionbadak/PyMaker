<p>I have created a quiz system which tests the user on two different topics. They are can choose whih topics they would like to do and a difficulty they wish to complete it in. If they get the question correct they get a point if they don't it will display the correct answer.</p>
<p>I am struggling to calculate the percentage based on the user's correct answers. For example, I have came up with "percent = score/100 x 100" which doesn't work. Any suggestions of calculating the percentage from these lists? </p>
<pre><code>t = input("Choose 'a' for arithmetics or 'g' for german:")
d = input("Choose 'e' for easy , 'm' for medium , 'h' for hard:")


arithQeasy = [
    ("What is 4 + 4? Choose 1 or 2: 1) 8 2) 7","1"),
    ("What is 16 + 16? Choose 1 or 2: 1) 26 2) 32","2"),
    ]


arithQmedium = [
    ("How many 6's in 36? Choose 1, 2 or 3: 1) 6 2) 12 3) 3","1"),
    ("What is the Square root of 100? Choose 1, 2 or 3: 1) 50 2) 100 3) 10","3"),
    ("What is 0x1000? Choose 1, 2 or 3: 1) 1000 2) 0 3) 100","2"),
    ]

if t == "a" and d == "e":
    questions = arithQeasy

elif t == "a" and d == "m":
    questions = arithQmedium

for question, answer in questions:
    userInput = input(question + '')
    if userInput == answer:
       score +=1
       print ("correct your score is:",score)
    elif:
       print ("Incorrect the anseer is:",answer)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The following seems to work. Note there are a couple of issues with your code snippet:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>elif</code> in the <code>for</code> loop needs to be an <code>else</code>.</li>
<li>You need to initialize <code>score</code> to zero before entering the <code>for</code> loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've fixed these problems and added some code at the end illustrating how to compute the percentage of correct answers, as you asked how to do:</p>
<pre><code>...
score = 0
for question, answer in questions:
    userInput = input(question + '')
    if userInput == answer:
       score += 1
       print("correct your score is:", score)
    else:
       print("Incorrect the anseer is:", answer)

percent = round((score / len(questions)) * 100, 2)
print('percent right: {}%'.format(percent))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>This works because a percentage is "a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100" (from the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage" rel="nofollow noreferrer">percentage</a>), so the expression calculates the ratio of right answers, <code>score</code>, to the total number of questions, <code>len(questions)</code>. It then multiples that by 100 since percentages always express this ratio as a "fraction of 100". </p>
<p>I also added a call to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>round()</code></a>—which wasn't strictly necessary—to limit the number of digits after the decimal point to two, so long numbers like <code>6.666666666666666%</code> would get converted to <code>6.67%</code>. Technically this makes the final value computed slightly less accurate, but I doubt that matters here.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The code does work, but I do not understand how the percentage is calculated. Could you please explain the code for calculating the percent? Thankyou</span>
