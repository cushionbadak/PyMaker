<p>I have a internal scheduler tool which runs a python script on a remote server. I am using <code>configparser</code> module within my script. When I run this script through the tool it gives me below error. </p>
<pre><code>ImportError: No module named configparser
</code></pre>
<p>I don't have access to that remote server so I can't just login to server and install required module.</p>
<p>Is there any way through which I can install configparser module by running any installation script on remote server through the tool ( I can neither download package on remote server nor run any commands, All I can do is, running scripts through this tool.) Please let me know if you need more clarification on this.</p>

<p>How about you do something like this. Create a python script that calls a bash script to do what you want:</p>
<p>install.py:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess

script = """
source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
pip install AnyPackage
"""

subprocess.call(['sh', '-c', script])
</code></pre>
<p>I am assuming you are using a virtualenv. If not, I assume the account that the script-runner uses has sudo access.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">no way you have to have credentials</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That module is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">part of the standard library</a> anyway, there is no need to install it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanielRoseman â€¦but it has been renamed from Python 2 to Python 3 and that might be the problem. Ankur should check if he is using the same Python version von all systems.</span>
