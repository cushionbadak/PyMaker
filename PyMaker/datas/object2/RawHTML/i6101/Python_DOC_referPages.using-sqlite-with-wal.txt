<p>I've been following Python documentation on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SQLite tutorial</a> and I managed to create an Employee table and write to it.</p>
<pre><code>import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('employee.db')
c = conn.cursor()

firstname = "Ann Marie"
lastname = "Smith"
email = "ams@cia.com"

employee = (email, firstname, lastname)

c.execute('INSERT INTO Employee Values (?,?,?)', employee)
conn.commit()

# Print the table contents
for row in c.execute("select * from Employee"):
    print(row)

conn.close()
</code></pre>
<p>I've been reading about the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Write-Ahead Logging</a>, but I can't find a tutorial that explains how to implement it. Can someone provide an example?</p>
<p>I notice Firefox, which uses SQLite, locks the file in such a way that if you attempt to delete the sqlite file while using Firefox, it will fail saying "file is open or being used"(or something similar), how do I achieve this? I'm running Python under Windows 10.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PRAGMA journal_mode documentation</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the journal mode could not be changed, the original journal mode is returned. [â€¦]<br/>
  Note also that the journal_mode cannot be changed while a transaction is active.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you have to ensure that the database library does not try to be clever and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#sqlite3-controlling-transactions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">automatically starts a transaction</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You didn't notice that the SQLite3 documentation you cite tells you how, using <code>PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@varro - I did but it doesn't work, the WAL file never gets created. According to the documentation it's supposed to be created where the database is located.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you provide an example of how to enable and use WAL with SQLite and Python?</span>
