<p>I'm looking at this piece of code here:</p>
<pre><code>if operation:   
  print('{} {} {} = '.format(number_1, operation, number_2))
  answer = number_1 + operation + number_2
  print(answer)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm trying to pass in the operation so that there wouldn't be a need for a bunch of if statements?</p>
<p>How would I go about doing this? if this is possible at all?</p>

<p>See more about eval here (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9383740/what-does-pythons-eval-do">What does Python's eval() do? </a>)   </p>
<pre><code>s = number_1 + operation + number_2 
print(eval(s))

<span class="comment-copy">Why not use functions? You can store those in a dictionary too, mapping operation to function: <code>operations = {'+': lambda a, b: a + b, '*': lambda a, b: a * b, ...}</code>. ;Then use <code>answer = operations[operation](number_1, number_2)</code> to look up the function and call it, passing in your two numbers. Or use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>operator</code> module</a> to avoid writing your own functions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please warn OP the side effects of using <code>eval</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">this can be unsafe, and so thorough</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are safer ways to do this, let's not insta-reach for the <code>eval()</code> function, that leads to hard lessons in security later on.</span>
