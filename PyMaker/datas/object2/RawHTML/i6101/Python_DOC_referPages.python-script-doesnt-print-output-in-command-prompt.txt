<p>I need some advice with a Python script. I'm still new and learned it by myself. I found the script on Google. After I retype it, it doesn't print the result in the console. How can the result of the script be shown in the console? Details as below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:\Python27&gt;test1.py af8978b1797b72acfff9595a5a2a373ec3d9106d</p>
<p>C:\Python27&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After I press enter, nothing happens. Should the result be shown or not?</p>
<p>Here's the code that I retyped:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
#coding: ascii

import requests
import sys
import re

url = 'http://hashtoolkit.com/reverse-hash?hash='
try:
    hash = sys.argv[1]
except:
     print ("usage: python "+sys.argv[0]+" hash")
sys.exit()

http = request.get(url+hash)
content = http.content
cracked = re.findall("&lt;span title=\*decrypted (md5|sha1|sha384|sha512) hash\*&gt;(.*)&lt;/span&gt;", content) # expression regular
print ("\n\tAlgoritmo: "+cracked[0][0])
print ("\tPassword Cracked: "+cracked[0][1])
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The first line in your script is called a <code>Shebang line</code>.
A Shebang line tells the script to run the Python interpreter from that location.</p>
<p>The shebang line you provided is a Linux system path, but it looks from the path you are executing Python from, that you are running on Windows.</p>
<p>You can do one of two things here to fix that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the Shebange Line.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Remove the first line from your script.</li>
<li>Execute the script using <code>python test1.py COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS</code></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Modify Your Shebang line.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Change the first line of your script from <code>!/usr/bin/python</code> to
  <code>#!python</code> (This is assuming that python is in your systems <code>PATH</code> variable.)`</p></li>
<li><p>Execute the script using <code>test1.py COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENTS</code></p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, you are trying to import the <code>requests</code> module that is not installed in the standard library. </p>
<p>If you haven't installed this yet, you can do so by going to your Python install directory and go to the <code>scripts</code> folder.</p>
<p>Hold <code>shift</code> and right click and go <code>Open command window here</code></p>
<p>Type <code>pip install requests</code> and hit enter.</p>
<p>After that you <strong>should</strong> be good to go, execute the script by navigating to it and type <code>test.py COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENT</code></p>
<p>If a Python script doesn't have the <code>shebang line</code>:</p>
<p><code>python test.py COMMAND_LINE_ARGUMENT</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you need to run your script using python. try:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Python27&gt;python test1.py af8978b1797b72acfff9595a5a2a373ec3d9106d

<span class="comment-copy">nice answer! but i recommend you to rewrite your answer as beauty format...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have modified my answer to the beauty format.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If shebangs are supported in Windows, it's due to associating .py files with Python 3's py.exe launcher. The launcher supports common Unix paths in shebangs such as <code>!/usr/bin/python</code>, which will prefer the highest version of Python 2 that's installed over Python 3 since <code>python</code> in Unix systems is typically Python 2. A shebang line is not required. The launcher will use its default version if no shebang is found; also, some (typically 2.x) installations associate .py with python.exe directly. Please read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">already done as adviced but still same thing happen.not showing the result on cmd promt screen</span>
<span class="comment-copy">after type the script test1.py command_line_argument and execute,return back to nothing</span>
<span class="comment-copy">He has a shebang line at the top of his script. That tells the script to use Python automatically. He's just using a Linux shebang instead of a Windows one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes,i use same command to run the script.but nothing happen.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ah...noted.will try to modified the scrip.tks dude</span>
