<p>Let's imagine this code:</p>
<pre><code>    try:
        if condition1 and condition2: # some_exception may happen here
            function1()
        elif condition3 and condition4: # some_exception may happen here
            function2()
        else:
            big
            block
            of
            instructions
    except some_exception:
        big
        block
        of
        instructions
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see I repeat big block of instructions (both are same).
Is there a way to avoid repetition, but something different than putting the code in a function?</p>
<p>Some kind of different logic or using finally or else to try? I just can't figure it out.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for helping me!</p>

<p>If you are averse to using a function, how about setting a variable in both places, and checking it later?</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>do_stuff = False
try:
    if condition1 and condition2: # some_exception may happen here
        function1()
    elif condition3 and condition4: # some_exception may happen here
        function2()
    else:
        do_stuff = True
except some_exception:
    do_stuff = True
    ...

if do_stuff:
    big
    block
    of
    instructions
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>try:
    if condition1 and condition2: # some_exception may happen here
        function1()
    elif condition3 and condition4: # some_exception may happen here
        function2()
    else:
         raise some_exception('This is the exception you expect to handle')
except some_exception:
    big
    block
    of
    instructions
</code></pre>
<p>What about this ? </p>

<span class="comment-copy">You could set a variable in your <code>else</code> and <code>except</code> clauses, and after the block, if the variable is set, call your <code>big block of instructions</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Create a function from that big block and call it in the necessary places.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you could manually throw an exception in the <code>else</code> clause and only have to put the <code>big block</code> in the <code>except</code></span>
