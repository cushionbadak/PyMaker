<p>[enter image description here][1]I have a data frame named election and I want to find set the winner column as NaN for rows where the margin is less than 1</p>
<p>![enter image description here][2]</p>
<p>I am doing something like this</p>
<pre><code>too_close = election['margin']&lt;1

election.loc[too_close, 'winner'] = np.nan # THIS IS WORKING
</code></pre>
<p>My question is since <code>election.loc[too_close, 'winner']</code> and  <code>election[too_close].winner</code> both return pandas series. Why setting the column value using latter doesn't work and the former works. I am new to pandas. Here is the data frame's 5 initial values</p>
<pre><code>          state   total      Obama     Romney  winner  voters    turnout     margin

<p>Pandas separates between <em>getting</em>  and <em>setting</em> (ie, changing) methods. Since setting modifies your original dataframe, Pandas wants to be more cautious about how you do it. <code>loc</code> is the official way to do this. Syntax like <code>election[too_close].winner</code> is simply a shortcut (or "sugar") for <em>getting</em>, but doesn't allow you to <em>set</em>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your image link seems broken. Can you fix that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!! Makes sense. So .loc is the only way to set the values?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not exactly the only way - have a look at <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html#Setting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this guide</a></span>
