<p>According to the Python 3 documentation, Chapter 25.1: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tkinter - Python interface to Tcl/Tk</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Tk interface is located in a binary module named <code>_tkinter</code>. This
  module contains the low-level interface to Tk</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where can I obtain the source code of this module?</p>
<p>I checked <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.6/Lib/tkinter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>python/cython</code></a> on GitHub, but could not find it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Found it <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Modules/_tkinter.c" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> on GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython" rel="nofollow noreferrer">cpython</a></p>

<p>Check also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/13924957/7952162">this answer</a> here which is related to your problem and gives this source (<a href="https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.6/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/3.6/</a>) from python.org.</p>
<p>How did I get there? In python,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import _tkinter
&gt;&gt;&gt; _tkinter.__file__
'/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/_tkinter.so'
</code></pre>
<p>Then in Google: "Python lib-dynload source".</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The source for _tkinter won't be very interesting, as it's just a wrapper for a tcl interpreter. What are you really looking for? If you're curious how widgets are actually constructed you'll want to look at the source code for tcl/tk.</span>
