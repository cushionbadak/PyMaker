<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to get data only after the page has been <em>completely</em> loaded; as in after the favicon turns from waiting to site's own icon. The source from where I am trying to get data from gives me 3 tables, these tables have same html so the same xpaths, i tried using:</p>
<pre><code>WebDriverWait(driver,timeout).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "someclass_name")))
</code></pre>
<p>But this condition passes as soon as either table is loaded and so my script declares the other two arrays for those tables to be 'None'. Also i tried using 'EC.staleness_of' which didnt work as it passes as soon the another page is loaded i.e; as soon as the page is refreshed. I want a way by which the condition passes only after everything is loaded, not that a particular element is located.
Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try below code to wait until all 3 tables appears in <code>DOM</code></p>
<pre><code>WebDriverWait(driver,timeout).until(lambda: len(driver.find_elements_by_class_name("someclass_name")) == 3)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Great! How about a more general case? For example; the page actually returns at most 3 tables, more like if the elements are dynamic what would be the best way?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Andersson Is <code>lambda</code> supported by Python 3.6.1 on Windows as well? Can you please refer me some documentations on the usage and implementation of <code>lambda</code>? Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DebanjanB, Yes, anonymous functions are supported by 3.6.1 version. You can get some description <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></span>
