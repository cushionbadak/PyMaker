<p>How can I split sentences, when punctuation is detected (.?!) and occurs between two words without a space? </p>
<p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; splitText = re.split("(?&lt;=[.?!])\s+", "This is an example. Not 
    working as expected.Because there isn't a space after dot.")  
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>['This is an example.', 
"Not working as expected.Because there isn't a space after dot."] 
</code></pre>
<p>expected:</p>
<pre><code>['This is an example.', 
'Not working as expected.', 
'Because there isn't a space after dot.']`
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>splitText = re.split("[.?!]\s*", "This is an example. Not working as expected.Because there isn't a space after dot.")
</code></pre>
<p>+ is used for 1 or more of something, * for zero of more.</p>
<p>if you need to keep the . you probably don't want to split, instead you could do:</p>
<pre><code>splitText = re.findall(".*?[.?!]", "This is an example. Not working as expected.Because there isn't a space after dot.")
</code></pre>
<p>which gives</p>
<pre><code>['This is an example.',
 ' Not working as expected.',
 "Because there isn't a space after dot."]
</code></pre>
<p>you can trim those by playing with the regex (eg <code>'\s*.*?[.?!]'</code>) or just using <code>.trim()</code></p>

<pre><code>import re
from pprint import pprint

split_text = re.findall(".*?[?.!]", "This is an example! Working as "
                        "expected?Because.")

pprint(split_text)
</code></pre>
<p>Note: <code>.*?</code> is a lazy (or non-greedy) quantifier in opposite to <code>.*</code> which is a greedy quantifier. </p>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>['This is an example!', 
 ' Working as expected?', 
 'Because.']
</code></pre>
<p>Another solution:</p>
<pre><code>import re
from pprint import pprint

split_text = re.split("([?.!])", "This is an example! Working as "
    "expected?Because.")

pprint(split_text)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>['This is an example', 
'!', 
' Working as expected', 
'?', 
'Because', 
'.', 
'']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Still doesn't work! The last sentence is not divided when "dot" is detected...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zppinto yeah, i just noticed that, edited the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you look at the documentation of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">split</a> there is a note that mentions that split doesn't work on empty matches, that's the reason <code>(?&lt;=[.?!])\s*</code>doesn't work if there is no space.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zppinto use findall instead of split, adding to my answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This solution won't work if there are common abbreviations like <code>Mr.</code>, <code>etc.</code> inside the sentence.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It works, but I lost the punctuation and that is not a solution for me. @SebastianProske has made the point... This can't be done with <code>split</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now is it ok ? ....</span>
