<p>There is a button "Show Ignored" in Pycharm test run window. I wonder, how to mark some test as ignored?</p>

<p>With just Python <code>unittest</code>, you can decorate a test to be skipped with <code>@skip</code>. From <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html#skipping-tests-and-expected-failures" rel="noreferrer">unittest — Unit testing framework — Python 2</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#skipping-tests-and-expected-failures" rel="noreferrer">unittest — Unit testing framework — Python 3</a>:</p>
<pre><code>class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    @unittest.skip("demonstrating skipping")
    def test_nothing(self):
        self.fail("shouldn't happen")

    @unittest.skipIf(mylib.__version__ &lt; (1, 3),
                     "not supported in this library version")
    def test_format(self):
        # Tests that work for only a certain version of the library.
        pass

    @unittest.skipUnless(sys.platform.startswith("win"), "requires Windows")
    def test_windows_support(self):
        # windows specific testing code
        pass
</code></pre>
<p>I assume PyCharm is showing you the skipped tests.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I did not even tried to ask google for simple "python skip unittest". I've looked for "ignoring" them. Shame on me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I had to dig a bit to remember it was skip. <code>@ignore</code> would probably have been a better choice. :)</span>
