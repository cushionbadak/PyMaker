<p>I am trying to pass a python script variables from another python script in a python script. What I am trying to do in code form:</p>
<p>file1.py</p>
<pre><code>global x
x = 7
</code></pre>
<p>file2.py</p>
<pre><code>print x
</code></pre>
<p>file3.py</p>
<pre><code>import file1
import file2
</code></pre>
<p>But I always get the error x is not defined. If I import file1 in file2 and run it, it works, but if I run file2 from file3 it does not work.</p>
<p>Help would be much appreciated :)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't have to use <code>global</code>.</p>
<p><strong>file1.py</strong></p>
<pre><code>x = 7
</code></pre>
<p><strong>file2.py</strong></p>
<pre><code>from file1 import x

print(x)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>file3.py</strong></p>
<pre><code>...
</code></pre>
<p>But if it was me, I'd guess you want something like this:</p>
<p><strong>file1.py</strong></p>
<pre><code>def get_x(x):
    return x
</code></pre>
<p><strong>file2.py</strong></p>
<pre><code>from file1 import get_x

x = get_x(3)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>file3.py</strong></p>
<pre><code>from file2 import x

print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, you just have to <em>play</em> around with explicit imports depending on what you need to accomplish. However, this looks weird and I can't recommend it to anyone because either one of <em>file1.py</em> or <em>file2.py</em> seem to be useless. </p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doc about imports</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Don't think in terms of "global variables", think in terms of explicit imports: <code>from file1 import x</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>import</code> in Python is very different from <code>include</code> in PHP.  Each module in Python has its own namespace, and importing a module using <code>import foo</code> only adds the name <code>foo</code> to the importing moudle's namespace.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SiHa yea you are right that would have answerde my question, I just did not find it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yea I know, but I wrote a few scripts that depend on each other, but in case of an error I want to be able to execute each part by itself. But thanks for your help :)</span>
