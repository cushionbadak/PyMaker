<p>The main aim is of my code is: </p>
<p>If variable x is equal to a value then I want to reassign x with a different value. eg if x = a then reassign x to = 1 but if x = b then reassign x to = 2. I have around 50 values I want to compare x against to see if it equals one of them.</p>
<p>With my basic Python knowledge, I can see one way to achieve this by using 50 if statements in a function, haha but surely there must be a much simpler more code efficient way?</p>
<pre><code>def testfunc(x):
    if x == "url1":
        x = 'company1'

    if x == 'url2':
        x = 'company2'

    if x == 'url3':
        x = 'company3'

    # plus 47 more 'if' statements
    return x
</code></pre>
<p>I was thinking using a dictionary may be better where if x = key then make x = value, would this be a better approach? Or is there an even better way?</p>
<p>Some direction on the best way to code this or a simple example to get me started would be much appreciated.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, a dictionary would work well.</p>
<pre><code>def testfunc(x):
    d = {
        'url1': 'company1',
        'url2': 'company2'
    }
    return d[x]

x = 'url1'
x = testfunc(x)
print(x)    # 'company1'
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">you could just do, <code>x = x.replace('url', 'company')</code>, if the numbers are symmetrical.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">At least use elif in case like this but @101 has right with dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this will give a KeyError if <code>x not in d</code>. If this is not wanted behaviour, you can use <code>d.get(x, x)</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>)</span>
