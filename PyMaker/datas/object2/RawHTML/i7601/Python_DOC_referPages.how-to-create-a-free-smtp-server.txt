<p>I am not at all familiar with <code>SMTP</code> but I am working on sending <code>emails</code> through <code>Python</code> code. I have the code but I need to pass <code>SMTP</code> <code>host name</code> for it to actually work. Is there any service which provides a free <code>SMTP</code> service that I leverage for testing out my code? I looked around to create my own <code>SMTP server</code> but couldn't find something that provides a step by step guide to create a <code>SMTP server</code>. I want to create a free server(or if there is any free service) that will provide me with a host name(<code>ip</code> address) so that I can put that host name in my python code and execute it from any machine.</p>
<p>If anyone can point me in the right direction it will be helpful.</p>

<p>You need service like <a href="https://mailtrap.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://mailtrap.io/</a>. You'll get SMTP server address (eventually port number) that you point your application to. All e-mails produced by your application will be then intercepted by mailtrap (thus not delivered to the real <code>To:</code> address).</p>
<p>They offer free variant that seems to be suitable for your needs.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">is <code>smtp.gmail.com:587</code> a valid SMTP host name that I can actually use in my code or is just a sample example?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2916886 check the last link. It is mentioned there. I think you need a gmail account or similar. It's best you read it yourself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can use that in your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am getting <code>OSError: [WinError 10013] An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions</code> when I am trying to run my code using <code>'smtp.gmail.com:587</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was able to resolve above error by disabling email sending blocking in my antivirus as well as enabling <code>access from less secure app</code> in my gmail account</span>
