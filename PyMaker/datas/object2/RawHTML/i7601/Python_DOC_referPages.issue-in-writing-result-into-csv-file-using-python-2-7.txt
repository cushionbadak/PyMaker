<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am using python 2.7 in my Windows 10(64-bit) system. I have a string <em>str</em>, when executed it shows result as :-</p>
<pre><code>'abcd'
'wxyz'
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I want to write this result into result.csv file. So I wrote this following python scrip:-</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open('result.csv', 'w') as csv_file:
     csv_write = csv.writer(csv_file)
     csv_write.writerow([str]) 
</code></pre>
<p>But whenever I execute this script, I am finding only <em>wxyz</em> in result.csv file.</p>
<p>Help me with this issue.
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Python 2.7 <code>csv</code> likes the <code>'b'</code> mode for writing (in Python 3 just <code>'w'</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Pre-built list of <code>string</code> to file</p>
<pre><code>import csv

strings = []
s1 = 'abcd'
s2 = 'wxyz'
strings.append(s1)
strings.append(s2)

csvf = r"C:\path\to\my\file.csv"

with open(csvf, 'wb') as f:
    w = csv.writer(f, delimiter=',')
    for s in strings:
        w.writerow(s)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Use of <code>reader()</code> to build list of rows to supply <code>writer()</code></p>
<pre><code>import csv

# read current rows in csv and return reader object
def read(_f):
    with open(_f, 'rb') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=',')
    return reader

# writes the reader object content
# then writes the new content to end
def write(_f, _reader, _adding):
    with open(_f, 'wb') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f, delimiter=',')
        for row in _reader:
            writer.writerow(row)
        for row in _adding:
            writer.writerow(row)


strings = []
s1 = 'abcd'
s2 = 'wxyz'
strings.append(s1)
strings.append(s2)

csvf = r"C:\path\to\my\file.csv"

content = read(csvf)

write(csvf, content, strings)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Quick append</p>
<pre><code>import csv

strings = []
s1 = 'abcd'
s2 = 'wxyz'
strings.append(s1)
strings.append(s2)

csvf = r"C:\path\to\my\file.csv"

with open(csvf, 'ab') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f, delimiter=',')
    for s in strings:
        writer.writerow(s)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>References:</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 2.x</a>, the <code>reader()</code> and <code>writer()</code> objects required a <code>'b'</code> flag upon opening. This was a result of how the module handle line termination.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 3.x</a> this was changed so that <code>reader()</code> and <code>writer()</code> objects should be opened with <code>newline=''</code>; line termination is still handled however. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">you should never name your objects after built-ins like <code>str</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you post the entire script, seems like a little bit of information is missing</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Based on your comment to my answer, you should update your post to show the full picture here. I think some code is missing...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the information @pstatix. But I want to extract 'abcd' and 'wxyz' from str and and write it to csv file.How should I do it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3766871 What do you mean by "extract...from str"? If you have a variable called <code>str</code> and those values are inside it; that's a whole other question.</span>
