<p>I am attempting to train a TensorFlow model in Windows 10 using these steps: <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/attention_ocr#requirements" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/attention_ocr#requirements</a></p>
<p>I have installed virtualenv for Windows (<a href="http://www.tylerbutler.com/2012/05/how-to-install-python-pip-and-virtualenv-on-windows-with-powershell/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">following this example</a>)</p>
<p>The source command is not recognized by Windows, what needs to be done so that when I run the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/attention_ocr#how-to-use-this-code" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subsequent steps</a> so that python sees what virtulenv created? Is there something related to the 'source' command needed in Windows? I can see virtualenv created the ~/.tensorflow folder, but I do not see a 'bin/activate' folder inside that. I tried adding the full path to ~/.tensorflow to my Windows PATH, but I still get the following error when I run the train on inception_v3.ckpt:</p>
<pre><code>    import StringIO
ImportError: No module named 'StringIO'
</code></pre>

<p>Since you are running TensorFlow on Windows, I would guess that you are using Python 3.x. The <code>StringIO</code> module was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#text-vs-data-instead-of-unicode-vs-8-bit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">removed in Python 3.0</a>, so the code you are running appears not to be compatible with Python 3.x. I would recommend filing an <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/issues" rel="nofollow noreferrer">issue on the GitHub repository</a>, but you may be able to fix it by replacing <code>import StringIO</code> with <code>import six</code>, and any uses of <code>StringIO.StringIO</code> with <code>six.StringIO</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Note, the error above is after having coppied fsns.py and other files from the datasets folder down to the Python folder, this seems a mistake as I should instead be looking at why python does not see them when following the steps from the tutorial.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">still have not ironed this all out yet, but see what you mean about this model targeting a previous version of python :/ ... for now, battling other issues when trying to setup that version of python with virtualenv. Right now looks like the windows build (1.2.1) for tensorflow_gpu is broken, or pypi.pythong.org is having other issues.</span>
