<p>Currently, I am using this to download a file but it is placing them in the same folder where it is being run from, but how would I save the downloaded file to another directory of my choice.</p>
<pre><code>r = requests.get(url)  
with open('file_name.pdf', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(r.content)

<p>Or if in Linux, try:</p>
<pre><code># To save to an absolute path.
r = requests.get(url)  
with open('/path/I/want/to/save/file/to/file_name.pdf', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(r.content)


# To save to a relative path.

<p>You can just give <code>open</code> a full file path or a relative file path</p>
<pre><code>r = requests.get(url)  
with open(r'C:\path\to\save\file_name.pdf', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(r.content)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As long as you have access to the directory you can simply change your <code>file_name.pdf'</code> to <code>'/path_to_directory_you_want_to_save/file_name.pdf'</code> and that should do what you want.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>open('somefolder/file_name.pdf', 'wb')</code>â€¦!?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why don't people just try the obvious?  <code>open()</code> takes a path, not a filename, so give it a path!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what about if it's a downloaded zip folder and you want to save it in a directory</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The above would also work to save a zip file (the path defined as as a URL) to a specific directory (e.g. <code>/path/I/want/to/save/file/to/archive.zip</code>).  Or do you mean to download an archive from a URL and extract it to a folder?</span>
