<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a small tkinter gui that generates some reports. I built a quit button into it. The button works perfectly when I launch the script, but I converted it to an exe with cx_freeze and the entire program is working except the quit button. </p>
<pre><code>def quits():
    quit()
</code></pre>
<p>I created the quit button to call this <code>quits</code> function because I read that just calling quit directly could cause problems. Anyone have any idea why this is not working as an exe?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As per the comments the <code>quit</code> function doesn't work outside of the interpreter</p>
<pre><code>def quits():
    sys.exit()
</code></pre>
<p>That does the trick</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You should <code>import sys; sys.exit(0)</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">quit() is an interpreter function, not a Python language function.  It exits the interpreter.  Since you're running a C program, there is no interpreter to exit.  Are you getting an error or is the button just not doing anything?  In any case, I found this thread: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73663/terminating-a-python-script" title="terminating a python script">stackoverflow.com/questions/73663/terminating-a-python-script</a>.  Use sys.exit() or os._exit() instead to kill a thread or an entire program at the C level</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please read the documentation of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#quit" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>quit</code></a>: "[...] useful for the interactive interpreter shell and should not be used in programs".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/19747562/7073884">this link</a> will provide more than enough information.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the help guys I will look into the sys functions. I am not getting any errors. Still pretty new to this so no errors makes it hard to troubleshoot</span>
