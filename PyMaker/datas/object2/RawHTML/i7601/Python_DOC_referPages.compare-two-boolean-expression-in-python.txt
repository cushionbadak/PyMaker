<p>Your <code>x is None != y is None</code> is "<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">chained comparisons</a>". A more typical example is <code>3 &lt; x &lt; 9</code>. Which means the same as <code>(3 &lt; x) and (x &lt; 9)</code>. So in your case, with operators <code>is</code> and <code>!=</code>, that's this:</p>
<pre><code>(x is None) and (None != y) and (y is None)
</code></pre>
<p>Which is false because <code>y is None</code> is false.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Chained expressions are evaluated from left to right, besides, comparisons <code>is</code> and <code>!=</code> have the same precedence, so that your expression is evaluated as:</p>
<pre><code>(x is None) and (None!= y) and (y is None)
#---True----|------True-----|--- False---|
#-----------True------------|
#------------------False-----------------|
</code></pre>
<p>To change the order of evaluation, you should put some parens:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; (x is None) != (y is None)
True
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Also note that the first expression <code>x is None == y is None</code> was a fluke, or rather the red herring, as you'll get the same results if you place some parens in the required positions. It's probably why you assumed the order should start with the <code>is</code> first, then the <code>!=</code> in the second case. </p>
