<p>I am trying to build a small crawler to grab twitter handles. I cannot for the life get around an error I keep having. It seems to be the exact same error for re.search. re.findall and re.finditer. The error is <code>TypeError: expected string or buffer.</code></p>
<p>The data is structured as followed from the CSV: </p>
<pre>
30,"texg",@handle,,,,,,,,
</pre>
<p>Note that the print row works fine, the test = re.... errors out before getting to the print line. </p>
<pre><code>def read_urls(filename):
    f = open(filename, 'rb')
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    data = open('Data.txt', 'w')
    dict1 = {}
    for row in reader:
        print row   
        test = re.search(r'@(\w+)', row)
        print test.group(1)
</code></pre>
<p>Also not I have been working through this problem at a number of different threads but all solutions explained have not worked. It just seems like re isn't able to read the row call... </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Take a look at your code carefully:</p>
<pre><code>for row in reader:
    print row   
    test = re.search(r'@(\w+)', row)
    print test.group(1)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that row is a list not a string and according to search documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scan through string looking for the first location where the regular expression pattern produces a match, and return a corresponding MatchObject instance. <strong>Return None if no position in the string matches the pattern;</strong> note that this is different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the string.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means you should create a string and check whether <code>test</code> is not <code>None</code></p>
<pre><code>for row in reader:
    print row   
    test = re.search(r'@(\w+)', ''.join(row))
    if test:
        print test.group(1)
</code></pre>
<p>Also open file without <code>b</code> flag like</p>
<pre><code>f = open(filename, 'r')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're trying to read a list after you run the file through the reader.</p>
<pre><code>import re

f = open('file1.txt', 'r')
for row in f:
    print(row)
    test = re.search(r'@(\w+)', row)
    print(test.group(1))
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use the CSV reader, you can loop through the list.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>row</code> is a list, not a string, since you're using <code>csv.reader</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>row</code> in your for loop is a lsit of strings, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">accroding to the documentation</a>. So, maybe try <code>test = re.search(r'@(\w+)', ' '.join(row))</code>. I'm not sure if this is the issue, so thats why I'm making it a comment</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>test = re.search(r'@(\w+)', row[2]); if test: print(test.group(1))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you using a regexp? <code>csv.reader</code> parses the line into a list of fields. The twitter handle is always in <code>row[2]</code>.</span>
