<p>I want to sort 2 lists with combination but when i print this  code some outputs printing sometimes same acts or subs (ex: [act1,act1,sub5]) but I don't want that. </p>
<p>I want every output be different, if combination over, it should stop printing. And other thing I want, it give numbers for every output. For example :
line1 : 1.[act1,sub3,act,4] 
line2 : 2.[act2,sub2,act1]
...
....
....</p>
<p>How can i make this?</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the followind code is what you're looking for, have a look:</p>
<pre><code>import itertools

actions = ["act1","act2","act3","act4","act5","act6"]
subjects =["sub1","sub2","sub3","sub4","sub5","sub6"]

comb = map(' '.join, itertools.chain(itertools.product(actions, subjects)))

i = 0
for element in comb:
    print("{}. {}".format(i, element))
    i += 1

<span class="comment-copy">Could you please explain what is the expected out put . the first line is not clear</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should watch out, seems to me like you have a infinite loo, you should put an ending conditon and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops" rel="nofollow noreferrer">break</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you put your desired output more clearly, so that will more clear to answer you @ArdaAltun</span>
