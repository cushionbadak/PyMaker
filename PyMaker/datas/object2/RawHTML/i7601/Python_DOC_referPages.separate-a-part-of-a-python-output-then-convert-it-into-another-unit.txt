<p>I know the title makes it sounds all complicated, but it is actually simple.</p>
<p>So I am trying to collect system data with python, and I am using the psutil module with python 3.6. I want to find used memory, so I did the command <code>psutil.virtual_memory()</code>. However, the output I got was <code>svmem(total=8535257088, available=3911340032, percent=54.2, used=4623917056, free=3911340032)</code>.</p>
<p>I only want to keep the <code>used=4623917056</code> part of the output. How would I seperate that part from the output?</p>
<p>Also, <code>used=4623917056</code> is in bytes. I want to convert it to gigabytes, and keep the result to the 3 most significant digits (in this case it would be 4.62). How would I do this as well?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the simplest one:</p>
<pre><code>round(psutil.virtual_memory().used /(1024 ** 3),2)
</code></pre>
<p>in python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round" rel="nofollow noreferrer">round()</a> function will have two arguments one is value itself and other is a number of digits you want to keep after the decimal.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>vm = psutil.virtual_memory()
used_gb = vm.used / (1024 ** 3)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. However, this does not keep the first 3 digits. I just get the full thing (4.62......)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welcome.  Look at the format string options here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#formatspec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#formatspec</a> - maybe you'll find one that suits you.</span>
