<p>I download the python3 <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2-macosx10.6.pkg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">package</a> , and install it, and I find the pip3 is installed too.</p>
<pre><code>aircraftdeMacBook-Pro:~ ldl$ which python3
aircraftdeMacBook-Pro:~ ldl$ which pip3
....there I install the .dmg for python3 I download from the upper link.
aircraftdeMacBook-Pro:~ ldl$ which python3
/usr/local/bin/python3
aircraftdeMacBook-Pro:~ ldl$ python3 --version
Python 3.5.2
aircraftdeMacBook-Pro:~ ldl$ which pip3
/usr/local/bin/pip3 
</code></pre>
<p>So , I want to confirm if the pip3 package is include in the <code>.dmg</code> file, because when install the python3 the pip3 is installed too.</p>
<p>from the command lines you can see I only instal the python3 <code>dmg</code>, but the pip3 is installed too.</p>

<p>This is as expected.</p>
<p>Newer releases of Python 3 (3.4+?) come with pip pre-installed, as well as with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ensurepip</code></a> module.</p>
