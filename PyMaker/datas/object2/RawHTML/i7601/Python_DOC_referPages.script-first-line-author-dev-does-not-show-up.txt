<p>I am learning Python by watching youtube videos and also through an online course that I bought.  In every video I watch, the first line of each file is: <code>_author_='dev'</code>.  For some reason when I start a new file this does not come up.  What does this mean and if it is an issue how do I correct it?  </p>
<p>FYI I am using IntelliJ IDEA as an IDE.  </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>It is pre-compiled in some IDEs like PyDev but not in IDEA, you can add it manually if you want it. I also recommend you to use PyCharm instead of IDEA for python.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It means they have configured their IDE to include that boilerplate in new Python files they create. If you want it, add it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Aside: I recommend <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Python Tutorial</a>, part of the official Python documentation. It's free.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Moe, what does it mean though?  What would I gain by adding it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its for setting author to whatever name you provide, just like <code>__version__ </code>and <code>__credits__</code> ..etc its called metadata for the module. You can find more info here: <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/manual-fields.html#module-metadata-variables" rel="nofollow noreferrer">epydoc.sourceforge.net/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">awesome, thank you!</span>
