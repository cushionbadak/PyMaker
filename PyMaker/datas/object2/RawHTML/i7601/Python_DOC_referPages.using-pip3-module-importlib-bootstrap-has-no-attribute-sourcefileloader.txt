<p>I have installed pip for python 3.6 on Ubuntu 14. After I run</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python3-pip
</code></pre>
<p>to install pip3, it works very well. However, after installation, when I am trying to run</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install packagename
</code></pre>
<p>to install a new package, something strange occurs:</p>
<pre><code>File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 1479, in &lt;module&gt;
 register_loader-type(importlib_bootstrap.SourceFileLoader, DefaultProvider)
AttributeError: module "importlib._bootstrap" has no attribute "SourceFileLoader"
</code></pre>
<p>It seems that I did nothing wrong, and I really cannot figure out the reason.</p>

<p>Faced the same problem. I think this is because <code>python3.6</code> and <code>pip3</code> were installed from different sources.
I suggest using python's inbuilt facility to install pip i.e</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
</code></pre>
<p>This should install <code>pip3</code> and <code>pip3.x</code> where x in <code>python3.x</code>.
Same works for <code>python2</code> also.</p>

<p>I can't edit my existing answer, so I had to add another one:</p>
<p>This worked for me:</p>
<pre><code>sudo pip install python-dotenv
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I met the same problem, this is the key:</p>
<pre><code>curl -sS https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo python3

<span class="comment-copy">Does that happen for every package you try to install?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like issue is with python version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SamChats yepâ€¦ Actually every time I type "pip3" this problem occurs, such as "pip3 --version" etc.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@phd Why did you post that. The reason people came here is because the first command of the top answer does not work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">'/usr/bin/python3.6: No module named ensurepip' Any ideas?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's strange! According to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html</a> <code>ensurepip</code> is part of python standard library. Are you sure you installed python correctly and is accessible as well?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is <code>ensurepip</code> available on Ubuntu? On my Ubuntu environment, I can't import it. Maybe, on many other environments, <code>ensurepip</code> is not available.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@H.Jang Yeah. Its a bug in Ubuntu. <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python3.4/+bug/1290847" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python3.4/+bug/1290847</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked perfectly for me. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why can't you edit your other answer?</span>
