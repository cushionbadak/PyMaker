<p>Hi in the above code I want to search a particular node in the above xml tree say I am interested in the node roadName :I-25  and display the road name so can anyone guide me how this can be done ? finding a single node / subnode of interest in the xml tree with the help of element tree ?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As mentioned in the comment, what you have is <code>JSON</code> data (see related: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16675849/python-parsing-json-data-set">Python - Parsing JSON Data Set</a>).</p>
<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">json</a> module:</p>
<pre><code>import json

# if data is a json string
json_data = json.loads(data) # or use json.load(data) if data is a file
</code></pre>
<p>To get the values you want, index the respective keys from the data. In this case the parent node is <code>'incidents'</code>, of which you want the second list item (zero-indexed, so use <code>[1]</code>), then dig down through the corresponding keys:</p>
<pre><code>print json_data['incidents'][1]['parameterizedDescription']['roadName']
</code></pre>
<p>will output:</p>
<pre><code>I-25
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">This is JSON though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi thanks for the response.  Can you please guide me if say I have a variable say $road and a string is stored in the variable say $road = 'I-25' now I wish that every time the json changes the python program will search in the json and if I-25 string is present in the json output the python would display 1 or else 0. Can. You please guide me with an example ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also is it possible that I can use url that generates json data and pare it instead of Jon file ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes sure. Did this answer your original question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would be happy to guide you with both of those requests but that sounds like you want to do more than you original question here. You may want to start a new question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes actually. I will post a new question.</span>
