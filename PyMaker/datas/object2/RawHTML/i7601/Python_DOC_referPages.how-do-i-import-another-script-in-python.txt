<p>I'm creating a simple text-based adventure game. I have a long piece of code for combat, but I don't want to copy+paste it every time there's a fight. Is there a way for me to put the combat code into another script, and simply run that whenever combat occurs?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Put that code in a function and save it in another file, in the same directory.</p>
<p>Then in the file where you want to use your function, import the file at the top like:</p>
<pre><code>import newFile
</code></pre>
<p>where newFile.py is the name of your file. You do not need .py here. And when you want to use a function from the imported file, use :</p>
<pre><code>newFile.newFunction()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To invoke a pythonsource use the <code>runpy</code>-module:</p>
<pre><code>import runpy
runpy.run_module(
    mod_name     = "combat.py",
    init_globals = None,
    run_name     = "__main__",
    alter_sys    = None
)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are going to do exactly that. First you will put at the top of your code <code>import theScript</code> then your code in that script should be a specific method called possibly doCombat, so you will call <code>theScript.doCombat()</code> in your piece of code.</p>
<p>A great tip that I learned in a computer science class is that if you are ever about to copy and paste code, 90% of the time it should be contained in a method which you should call.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your answer is in the title of your question...</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>import myscript</code></span>
