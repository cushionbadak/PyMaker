<p>I want to split an array in such a way that I can extract some sub-elements within the column, I am new to programming and in particular python, so please help...</p>
<pre><code>say A = [['18x24x16']
         ['18x12x14']
         ['18x24x12']
         ['18x48x10']]
</code></pre>
<p>I want to have something like:</p>
<pre><code>B = [['24' '16']
     ['12' '14']
     ['24' '12']
     ['48' '10']]
</code></pre>
<p>What function can I use and how?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If your array is a list of strings, where each string is a list of numbers separated by any character <code>'x'</code>, you can use:</p>
<pre><code>A = [['18x24x16'], ['18x12x14']]
B = [row[0].split('x') for row in A]
print(B)
# [['18', '24', '16'], ['18', '12', '14']]
</code></pre>
<p>Each element is still a string this way. If you want the actual numbers, use:</p>
<pre><code>B = [[int(elem) for elem in row[0].split('x')] for row in A]
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>int(elem)</code> if you want your values to all be integers, and <code>float(elem)</code> if you want them all to be floats (decimal-valued numbers).</p>

  [18, 24, 16],
  [18, 12, 14],
  [18, 24, 12],
  [18, 48, 10],
]

B = [[row[1] for row in A]]       # Each element is a list
B_prime = [row[1] for row in A]  # Each element is not a list.

<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>18x24x16</code>? New or old to programming, you could use few more words on explaining.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you are missing commas and what is the type of <code>18x24x16</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also be clear - is this a numpy array, or a list of lists?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's a numpy array, Those are like descriptions of 3D objects, for example length = 18, width = 24 and height = 16. I am reading those from a customers order, but to work on the real stuff, I need to extract the width and height alone.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, @Engineero, it worked perfectly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yours is a 4x3 array where you split the elements row-wise, but mine is a column array wherein I need to extract certain numbers from within rows with string data type.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My answer is for the question as it was asked at the time I answered it, before you edit it. You can't reproach me of answering wrongly a question that didn't even exist yesterday.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Very sorry about that. Hope you can still help</span>
