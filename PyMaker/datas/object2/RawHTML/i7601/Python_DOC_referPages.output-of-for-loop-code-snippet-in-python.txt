<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When Python first encounters the <code>for</code> loop, it builds the <code>range</code> object you requested: <code>range(0, 5, 1)</code>.  Once constructed, it controls the loop, and will <em>not</em> be reevaluated.  Changing the variable values during loop execution will not change the loop operation.</p>
<p>This means that, as far as the loop (or a sufficient optimizer) is concerned, your code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>i,j,k,u=0,5,1,3
for l in range(i,j,k) :
    print(l)

 u=8
 i=12
 j=7
 k=-1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Not sure what output you expect. But since you change the values of the parameters used for generating the range I assume that you expect the output to be longer. At that point the list is already generated however and will not be affected.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the possibility of increasing the loop range during the looping I suggest you avoid the range function and consider using while instead of for.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@Carcigenicate is right. We cannot help explain anything to you until we understand what <i>you</i> were expecting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Prune  and NacMacFeegle Thanks for your help, u solved the problem i had and  :)</span>
