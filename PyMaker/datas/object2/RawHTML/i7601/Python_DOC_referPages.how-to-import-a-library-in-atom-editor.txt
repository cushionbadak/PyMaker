<p>I'm new to Atom Editor and I have tried importing libraries by just including "Import pygame" or "Import kivy" at the top of my code. </p>
<p>However when I run my code it makes an error messages saying that there are no such modules with that name. </p>
<p>What's the proper way to make the editor import a library or a framework? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>No such modules error is related to Atom. Make sure that you have installed the necessary package in your virtual environment and run the application by activating the virtual environment.</p>
<p>Simply put, if you want to install Python packages, use the following the command in a terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install &lt;packages&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this Documentation example</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>Once they are installed, then you may import them in a Python script.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to install them before you can import them in a script. What version of python is this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How can I know if its installed? I used pip to install them on the command line but I'm not sure if they are installed or not? I have 2.7 and 3.6 both installed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have a feeling you installed them for 1 version of python and are trying to use them with the other. Which version do you want to install them for?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want the libraries to be installed for Python 3 and I also want to specify to the Editor that I'm using Python 3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not familiar with using atom, so I can't help with that part. Have you added python 3 to your systems PATH variable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you I'll look that up. Are there any tutorials regarding virtual environment you can refer me to?</span>
