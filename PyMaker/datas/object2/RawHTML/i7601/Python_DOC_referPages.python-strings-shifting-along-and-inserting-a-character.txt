<p>If I have a stream of individual characters in python and I want a string buffer 4 characters long, how can I have it so that the newest character goes to the end of the buffer and the other characters all shift down by one. </p>
<p>I have a stream of characters being fed from a serial port and decoded into a variable called <code>decoded</code> each run of the loop there is only one character read from the <code>ser.read()</code>. I wish to end the loop when a certain string is received. To do this I want to be able to put the characters into a buffer that I can check.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>decode each run of the loop will be</p>
<pre><code>H

e

l

l

o
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<pre><code>ser = serial.Serial(port='COM1')

PBIT = True
while PBIT
    read = ser.read()
    decoded = read.decode('utf-8')
</code></pre>
<p>Going into a variable called Buffer.</p>
<pre><code>"    "

"   H"

"  He"

" Hel"

"Hell"

"ello"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could create the buffer using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.deque</code></a> (double ended queue) of fixed length:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import deque

size = 4
decode = "Hello"
buffer = deque(' '*size, maxlen=size)

for x in decode: # simulates characters coming from a stream
    buffer.append(x)
    print(''.join(buffer))
</code></pre>
<p>Once the deque is full, an item is discarded from the opposite end to accommodate the new entry.</p>
<hr/>
<pre><code>   H
  He
 Hel
Hell
ello
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">How does adding the serial part make your question any clearer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suppose it doesn't. I was just trying to make it more obvious that the decode is only getting 1 character at a time. Sorry. I'll give the deque thing a try.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see. No no, no need for apologies. Just had to be sure. The <i>for</i> loop also gives you a character at a time.</span>
