<p>Given two lists, what is the best way to remove the intersection of the two?  For example, given:</p>
<pre><code>a = [2,2,2,3]
b = [2,2,5]
</code></pre>
<p>I want to return:</p>
<pre><code>a = [2,3]
b = [5]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Let's assume you wish to handle the general case (same elements appear more than once in each list), the so called <strong>multiset</strong>.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
intersection = Counter(a) &amp; Counter(b)
multiset_a_without_common = Counter(a) - intersection
multiset_b_without_common = Counter(b) - intersection
new_a = list(multiset_a_without_common.elements())
new_b = list(multiset_b_without_common.elements())
</code></pre>
<p>For your values of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, you'll get:</p>
<pre><code>a = [2,2,2,3]
b = [2,2,5]
new_a = [2, 3]
new_b = [5]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that for a special case of each element appearing exactly once, you can use the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#set" rel="noreferrer"><code>set</code></a>, as the other answers are suggesting.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can loop through the two lists and remove elements as you find an intersect point as the following:</p>
<pre><code>a = [2, 2, 2, 3]
b = [2, 2, 5]
delete = []
for c in a:
    for n in b:
        if n == c:
            delete.append(c)
            delete.append(n)
            break
    a.remove(delete[0])
    b.remove(delete[1])
    delete = []
print a
print b
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>[2, 3]
[5]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>a = [2,2,2,3]
b = [2,2,5]
for i in list(b): #I call list() on b because otherwise I can't remove from it during the for loop.
    if i in a:
        a.remove(i)
        b.remove(i)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>a = [2, 3]
b = [5]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you remove only <i>one</i> <code>2</code> from the first list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, what is the criteria of the sizes of these lists? Is it always going to be one list that is smaller than the other? Can they be equal lengths? Can you please provide more information around the boundaries of this type of filtering?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Suppose <code>a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 2]</code> and <code>b = [3, 2]</code>. What should the result be? As in, should you remove the first occurrence of <code>2</code> in <code>a</code> and thus get <code>a = [1, 4, 2]</code>, or remove the section that matches <code>b</code> best, i.e. <code>a = [1, 2, 4]</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No criteria on size - they cannot be null, but nothing else.  Which one to remove doens't matter.</span>
