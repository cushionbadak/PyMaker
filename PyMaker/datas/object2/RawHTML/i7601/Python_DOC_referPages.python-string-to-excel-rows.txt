<p>Hello I'm VERY new in python. I just have to do 1 thing with it.
When i print my string names, this is what comes up:</p>
<pre><code>{'id': 1, 'xd_id': 2, 'name': 'nameea', 'description': 'somethingveryweird', 'again_id': 6, 'some_id': None, 'everything': False, 'is_ready': False, 'test_on': None, 'something': None, 'something': [], 'count_count': 28, 'other_count': 0, 'again_count': 0, 'new_count': 0, 'why_count': 0, 'custom_count': 0, 'custom2_count': 0, 'custom3_count': 0, 'custom4_count': 0, 'custom5_count': 0, 'custom_status6_count': 0, 'custom7_count': 0, 'lol_id': 7, 'wtf_id': None, 'numbers_on': 643346, 'something_by': 99, 'site': 'google.com'}
</code></pre>
<p>I would to get this info to excel with the left row being the "id": and the right being the 1. And all the info like this. for example. "site" on the left and "google.com" on the right. my current code adds all this info to the first row on the excel and i can't seem to find any tutorial for this. Thanks for all answers. My current code:</p>
<pre><code>   f = open('test.csv', 'w')
   s = str(names)
   f.write(s)
   f.close()
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>if python is not going to be your key skill and only this task needs to be done, then here is the answer.</p>
<pre><code>f = open('test.csv', 'w')
csvwt = csv.writer(f)
for x in names.items():
  csvwt.writerow(x)
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>if you want to write to an excel, then you have to do this,</p>
<pre><code>workbook = xlsxwriter.Workbook('test.xlsx')
worksheet = workbook.add_worksheet()
row = 0
col = 0
for x in names.items():
    worksheet.write(row, col,     str(x[0]))
    worksheet.write(row, col + 1, str(x[1]))
    row += 1
workbook.close()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It looks like <code>names</code> is a dictionary. You should learn more about this datatype. Don't convert it to a string, use the methods of the dictionary instead.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">answer updated, now it should work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you so much it worked. kind of. It did what it supposed to do but there was an empty line between each one (don't really mind about that) but they were like id,1 on the first row and xd_id,2 on the second. I quess i didn't explain well enought, my bad but i wanted for the "id" to be for example on the Line A and the number on the Line B. So the A1 would be id and B1 would be 1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that works. THANK YOU SO MUCH! you are a king. Going to bookmark you and try to help you if you ever get in trouble with C++/C# or php. (those languages i actually know and have been using for years)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can make it simpler by using XlsxWriter's <code>write_row()</code> method (note the underscore, which is a different spelling than the <code>csv</code> module's <code>writerow()</code>.).</span>
