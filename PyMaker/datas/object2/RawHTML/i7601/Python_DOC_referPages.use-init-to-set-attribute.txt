<p>I'm trying pygame for a simple game. I want to have a class <code>Player</code> so that I can simply make a second or third player.</p>
<p>I want the player to have some attribute like HP. So my code is </p>
<pre><code>class Player():
    HP=100
    Speed=5
    ICON=pygame.image.load('somepic.ipg')
</code></pre>
<p>But later I want players to have different icons or HP so I tried</p>
<pre><code>class Player():

    def __init__(self,HP,ICON):
    self.HP=HP
    self.ICON=ICON
</code></pre>
<p>My code was like:</p>
<pre><code>P1=Player(80,someicon) 
P1.HP=P1.HP-damage
</code></pre>
<p>and something like this. But then I got </p>
<pre><code>AttributeError P1 doesn't have attribute.HP
</code></pre>
<p>I read the doc of <code>__init__</code> but I don't understand why it's not working. I know I can use:</p>
<pre><code>P1=Player()
P1.HP=80
P1.ICON=someicon
</code></pre>
<p>But I want to know more about class and <code>__init__</code>.</p>

<p>In your init method you have not indented the lines under the function def.   The self.* assignments should be indented further.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you but it's a failure when I typed here. it was right when I used them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried your code (with corrected indent) in jupyter notebook.   looked like i got the expected result and no error like you got.  might be code missing in your example?</span>
