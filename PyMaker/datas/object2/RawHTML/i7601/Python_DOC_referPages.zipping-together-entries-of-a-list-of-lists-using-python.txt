<p>If I have a list with multiple lists (for simplicity 3, but I actually have a very large amount):</p>
<pre><code>list = [[1,a,2],[3,b,4],[5,c,6]]
</code></pre>
<p>How do I obtain a new lists of lists that combines the original list items based on their positions using Python?</p>
<pre><code>new_list = [[1,3,5],[a,b,c],[2,4,6]]
</code></pre>
<p>I've been trying the zip function on "list" but it's not working, what am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>This does what you want. </p>

<p>Please don't use list, or any other <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built-in</a> as variable name. </p>

<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>list(map(list, zip(*mylist)))

                   *mylist    -- unpacks the list
               zip(*mylist)   -- creates an iterable of the unpacked list, 
                                 with the i-th element beeing a tuple 
                                 containing all i-th elements of each element of *mylist
         list                 -- Is the built-in function list()
     map( f  ,   iter      )  -- Applys a function f to all elements of an iterable iter
list(                       ) -- Creates a list from whatever is inside.

<p>You can use zip:</p>
<pre><code>a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
l = [[1,a,2],[3,b,4],[5,c,6]]

new_l = list(map(list, zip(*l)))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[[1, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6]]
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the variables are now displayed in the second element of <code>new_l</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to Stack Overflow! It is difficult to offer solutions when the problem statement is simply, "it doesn't work".  Please <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/44826603/edit">edit</a> your question to show what you actually tried, and give a more complete description of what you expected to happen and how that differs from the actual results.  See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a> for hints on what makes a good explanation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Additionally it would be nice to see what you tried with the <code>zip()</code> function, so that other users can learn from the mistake.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This will not work as intended in python 3.x. <code>map(..)</code> is still a map object. A list object must be created by <code>list(map(..))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>list</code> is not a keyword, technically speaking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Coldspeed it is not technically, but i don't know another word for it in english. : )</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>list</code> is a builtin class. That's enough ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Coldspeed thanks. : )</span>
