<p>After fetching data from Excel to Python, the dates have been fetched into python as '43422' format. How do I convert this integer to date format in python now?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You may be able to prevent this from happening in the first place when you read in the data: <code>pd.read_excel('file.xlsx')</code>. Make sure that the data is properly formatted as a date before you read in the file.</p>
<p>If you want to convert this number to a date after you read it in, use the fact that it represents the number of days since January 1, 1900:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime

d = '45422'

date = datetime.date(1900, 1, 1) + datetime.timedelta(int(d))
date
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>datetime.date(2024, 5, 12)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This ignores the fact that Excel considers 29th February to be a valid date, which it isn't. openpyxl contains utilities for handling time and date conversion.</span>
