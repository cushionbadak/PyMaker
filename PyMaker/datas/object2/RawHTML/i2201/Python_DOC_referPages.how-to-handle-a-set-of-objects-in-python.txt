<p>I have been given a class definition (and some methods) as shown:</p>

        self.name = name

<p>I was asked to a write a function read_stars(csv_filename) that takes as a parameter the name of a CSV file of person data and returns a list of Person objects, one for each line in the input file (and in the same order). The function should only require 7 - 10 lines. </p>
<p>Then I need to a create a new function filter_people(people, status) that takes a list of people and a "status" string and returns a new list containing just the people from the original list whose health status equals the status parameter. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's what I came up with so far:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>def read_stars(csv_filename):
    """reads file and sorts it then runs through a class"""
    items = []
    file = open(csv_filename, 'r')
    for row in file:
        name, age, weight, height = row.split(',')
        items.append(Person(name, int(age), float(weight), float(height)))
    file.close()
    return items
</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good. So, where am I stuck? In manipulating the filter_stars GLOBAL function. Is it possible to create a global function filter_stars(people, status) such that the output will be classified based on their bmi and status?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test code</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>bods = read_stars("stars.csv")
for status in ['Underweight', 'Normal', 'Overweight', 'Obese']:
    bods_with_status = filter_stars(bods, status)
    print("People who are {}:".format(status))
    for bod in bods_with_status:
        print(bod)
    print()
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Expected Output</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>People who are Underweight:
Ivan Ng (19) has a bmi of 14.75. Their status is Underweight.

People who are Normal:
Griselda Gribble (92) has a bmi of 22.83. Their status is Normal.
Lucy Lovelorn (14) has a bmi of 19.53. Their status is Normal.
Leslie McWhatsit (70) has a bmi of 21.74. Their status is Normal.

People who are Overweight:
Peter Piper (23) has a bmi of 26.99. Their status is Overweight.

People who are Obese:
Polly Perkins (47) has a bmi of 53.35. Their status is Obese.

<p>I am finding it impossible to come up with a global function that can output as above.</p>
<p>Help appreciated.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Not sure what the problem is. It takes 10 seconds to google how to filter a list, at which point all you have to do is come up with an appropriate filter condition. And you have that ready-made with the <code>status</code> method. Can you show us an attempt of yours to implement the <code>filter_stars</code> function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't even know that Python was capable of filtering a list. Do you mean like I can try using a for loop and 4 conditionals ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aran, thank you for the sensible advise. I will try it out. Will update.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please stop telling people to shove it. We get lots and lots of no-effort questions here every day, so it's only natural that we ask people to show us their failed attempts before we present them with a solution on a silver platter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I apologise if my remark was uncalled for. But please understand that some of us are still beginners, who have a genuine desire to learn and seek advise from knowledgeable people. Some of us do put in effort before posting a question. A 'no-effort' question it may be for some, but for beginners it is not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please note that I know how to google to find information on these topics. I participate in this community to get specific help with my coding. Not mere links to resources.</span>
