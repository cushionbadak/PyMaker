<p>I need to compress multiple files into one bz2 file in python. 
I'm trying to find a way but I can't can find an answer. 
Is it possible?</p>

<p>This is what tarballs are for. The <code>tar</code> format packs the files together, then you compress the result. Python makes it easy to do both at once with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>tarfile</code> module</a>, where passing a "mode" of <code>'w:bz2'</code> opens a new tar file for write with seamless <code>bz2</code> compression. Super-simple example:</p>
<pre><code>import tarfile

with tarfile.open('mytar.tar.bz2', 'w:bz2') as tar:
    for file in mylistoffiles:
        tar.add(file)
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't need much control over the operation, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.make_archive" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shutil.make_archive</code></a> might be a possible alternative, which would simplify the code for compressing a whole directory tree to:</p>
<pre><code>shutil.make_archive('mytar', 'bztar', directory_to_compress)
</code></pre>

<p>Take a look at python's bz2 library. Make sure to google and read the docs first!</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>bz2</code> has no concept of a "file". All it knows is "data". If you want to merge multiple files into a single bz2-compressed chunk of data, you have to find a way to split that data into individual files upon decompressing. This is not something that bz2 supports natively.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did it but it only receives "data" as input, not a folder or a bunch of files</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In fact I'm looking maybe it's not possible... <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1287672/how-to-bzip2-multiple-files-into-one-single-archive-file" title="how to bzip2 multiple files into one single archive file">superuser.com/questions/1287672/â€¦</a> here it says that bzip2 command only receives one file</span>
