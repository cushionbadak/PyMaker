<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>my query is like this getting all rows of a table, this is for pagination:</p>
<pre><code>totalReviewRows =  dbSession.execute(
   "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reviews WHERE book_id = :book_id",
   { "book_id": book['id'] }
).fetchone()
</code></pre>
<p>and it prints result like this, it looks like an array in js? but inside ():</p>
<pre><code>totalReviewRows = (1,)
</code></pre>
<p>what is that ()? and how do i convert the result which is 1 inside of it (1,) into integer? also, how can i make a query inside of flask to just return the result 1 and not inside ()?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>(1,)</code> is a <code>tuple</code>. <code>fetchone()</code> returns one record as a tuple. If no records are fetched, it returns <code>None</code>. </p>
<p>You can index the tuple in order to get the first element as below: </p>
<pre><code>totalReviewRows =  dbSession.execute(
   "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reviews WHERE book_id = :book_id",
   { "book_id": book['id'] }
).fetchone()[0]
</code></pre>
<p>And the result should be </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; totalReviewRows
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It's a tuple, you just need to take the first index</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@roganjosh hello, i am just introducting myself in python, how do i do it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is a tuple. It's similar to a js array, but it's immutable (you cannot add or remove elements). You can access elements using their indexes: <code>totalReviewRows[0]</code></span>
