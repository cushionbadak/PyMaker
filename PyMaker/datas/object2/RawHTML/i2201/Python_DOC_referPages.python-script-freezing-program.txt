<p>I am new here but I recently have been messing around with python and Qt. My situation is that one of the scripts I call does a lot of OS commands and basically waits for a response. When I call this script it runs fine and acts accordingly except in my main program the screen is frozen until I exit out of the cmd. I think this is because mt script just waits there for a response, is there anyway to make it so that even though the script is running and executing(waiting for response with cmd) the user can still use other aspects of the main program?</p>

<p>As mentioned in comments, you will need to use threading. Threading allows multiple functions to executed at the same time. Check out this link <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python threading</a>.
You'll just have to run your side script on a different thread.</p>
