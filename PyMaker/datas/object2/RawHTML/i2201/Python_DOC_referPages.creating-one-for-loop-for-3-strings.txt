<p>So I have a String called 'Number' with 'abf573'. The task is, to find out if the String 'Number' just has characters and numbers from the Hexadecimal System. </p>
<p>My plan was to make a for loop, where we go through each position of the String 'Numbers', to check with an if statement if it is something out of the Hexadecimal System. To check that, I thought about writing down the A-F, a-f and 0-9 into Lists or separat Strings. </p>
<p>My Problem now is, that I have never done something like this in Python. I know how to make for loops and if-/else-/elif-Statements, but I dunno how to implement this in to this Problem. </p>
<p>Would be nice, if someone can give me a hint, how to do it, or if my way of thinking is even right or not. </p>

<p>I find it quite smart and fast to try to convert this string into an integer using <code>int()</code>, and to handle the exception <code>ValueError</code> which occurs if it is not possible.<br/>
Here is the beautiful short code:  </p>
<pre><code>my_string = 'abf573'
try:
    result = int(my_string, 16)
    print("OK")
except ValueError:
    print("NOK")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Strings are <em>iterables</em>. So, you can write</p>
<pre><code>Number = '12ab'

for character in Number:
    if character in 'abcdef':
         print('it is HEX')
</code></pre>
<p>Also, there is an <code>isdigit</code> method on strings, so your number is hex is <code>not Number.isdigit()</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your way of thinking is okay; it would work, although there are easier solutions (like regular expressions).</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><b>I have a String called 'Number' with 'abf573'</b> What does this mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just try and see what happens. Then you can ask concrete questions here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tim i am assuming he wanted to say Number = "abf573"</span>
