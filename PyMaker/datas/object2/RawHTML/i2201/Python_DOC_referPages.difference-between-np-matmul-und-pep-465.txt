<p>I was reading <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html#whatsnew-pep-465" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.5.html#whatsnew-pep-465</a></p>
<p>Does that mean, that if I import numpy @ is equivalent to np.matmul()?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That is correct. As you can read in the <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>np.matmul</code></a> documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>The matmul function implements the semantics of the @ operator introduced in Python 3.5 following PEP465.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Dupe is a bit of a different question, but the first line of the top answer: "The @ operator calls the array's <b>matmul</b> method, not dot. This method is also present in the API as the function np.matmul."</span>
