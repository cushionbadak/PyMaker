<p>I am using python and invoking external utility "send-data" in my .py file as shown below,</p>
<pre><code>cmd=['send-data', '-f', file_name]
res = subprocess.run(cmd,stdout=subprocess.PIPE, input=b'a')
</code></pre>
<p>I have no control over send-data utility and it creates file under /tmp directory with random name as shown below in the response string.</p>
<pre><code>'a)bort, e)dit or s)end? send-data: the file remains in /tmp/pbadLWX .'
</code></pre>
<p>Wondering how can i delete the file "pbadLWX" under /tmp folder after each execution? Considering every time file name could be different?</p>

<p>You can parse the output via <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re</code></a> module and then delete the file via <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.remove" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.remove</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import re

f_name = re.search(r'\s(/tmp/[a-zA-Z]+)\s', res.stdout.decode('ascii')).group(1)
os.remove(f_name)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You shouldn't need to delete it manually. It's the temporary directory, after all. Usually it gets deleted when you reboot.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While it may work, I find it risky - a mistake in the regex and you delete something you didn't mean  to.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mkrieger1 This regex isn't too complicated and whatever it matches starts with <code>/tmp/</code> so in the end you're only deleting temporary files. And of course, unittests should reveal such problems in general.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is full error message and i am getting error, b'a)bort, e)dit or s)end? send-date: the problem report remains in /tmp/pbadLWXEnu and is not sent.\n'       f_name = re.search(r'(/tmp/[a-zA-Z]+) \.$', res).group(1)   File "/usr/lib/python3.5/re.py", line 173, in search     return _compile(pattern, flags).search(string) TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ammad This is because <code>subprocess.run</code> returns encoded output, so you need to decode in order to get a string. I updated my answer accordingly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for response. I got this message, AttributeError: 'CompletedProcess' object has no attribute 'decode'</span>
