<p>How to get the index-difference of things inside a list: use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>index()</code> method</a> : </p>
<pre><code>Train_stations = [ "Perrache", "Ampere", "Bellecour", "Cordeliers", "Louis", "Massena" ]

start_station = ""
ending_station = ""

while start_station not in Train_stations:

while ending_station not in Train_stations:
    print("Possible inputs: ", Train_stations)

idx_start = Train_stations.index(start_station)
idx_end = Train_stations.index(ending_station)

print("The stations are {} stations apart.".format ( abs(idx_start-idx_end)))

<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Possible inputs:  ['Perrache', 'Ampere', 'Bellecour', 'Cordeliers', 'Louis', 'Massena']
Where are you now?Ampere

<p>If the goal is to get the distance between station <code>indexes</code> you can simply use <code>.index()</code> and take the <code>abs()</code> of the difference.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">John, what do you think your code accomplishes? You got a list with data that you do not use at all. You ask for two user inputs so you got two strings in the variables. The range function works with integer numbers  - read the API <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">range()</a> - so I got not the slightest idea what <code>final</code> should become ... if you want to know how many stations are between one value and the other you could use the <code>index()</code> method to get where / if someting is contained in your list ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">After reading your solution this seems more logical what OP was trying to accomplish, well done</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you guys! it's very helpful!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why did you edit your first attempt using dictionaries?  that one would have been good if the OP wanted real miles between cities and had supplied those.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner ty, but after analyzing the input and what you stated it seemed this ouput  was more on <i>track</i> haha :)</span>
