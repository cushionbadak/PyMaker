<p>Let's say I have a method like the following</p>
<pre><code>def validate(self, item:dict, attrs:dict)-&gt; list:
</code></pre>
<p>If I want to be more specific and tell that my return type is a list of 
ValidationMessages?</p>
<p>How should I / Can I achieve that?</p>
<p>( I would check off the mark as a duplicate, since this is not about extending a list or flattening) I'm asking about how to be more specific on identifying the return type of a method....</p>

<p>With Python 3.6, hopefully built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">typing</a> package will do the job.</p>
<pre><code>from typing import List

def validate(self, item:dict, attrs:dict)-&gt; List[str]:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>Notation is a bit weird, since it uses brackets but works out pretty well.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Go straigth to the documentation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html</a> - define an alias and return that as type hint - your exactuse case would be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#type-aliases" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">More an opinion than an answer, but if you want strict type checking, Java is a better choice than Python... Anyway, PatrickArtner's comment is the answer...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This has nothing to do with flattening a list... @GabrielM</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes Patrick's comment is the answer</span>
