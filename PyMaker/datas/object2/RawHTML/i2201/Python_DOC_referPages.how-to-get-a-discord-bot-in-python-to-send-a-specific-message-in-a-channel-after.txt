<p>I want to be able to type !setreminder "Post this string later" 3 hours, and the bot will post this in a channel in 3 hours.</p>
<p>Would the below code work for this if I modified it? Or is there a better way to do this?</p>
<pre><code>async def my_background_task():
    await client.wait_until_ready()
    counter = 0
    channel = discord.Object(id='channel_id_here')
    while not client.is_closed:
        counter += 1
        await client.send_message(channel, counter)
        await asyncio.sleep(60) # task runs every 60 second
</code></pre>
<p>If I ran this command, would I be able to use other commands at the same time while the bot was waiting to post?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could do something like</p>
<pre><code>@client.command(pass_context=True)
async def setreminder(ctx,time:int,*arg:str):
  await asyncio.sleep(time)
  await client.say(f"\"{' '.join(arg)}\"")
</code></pre>
<p>Where you would run a <code>!setreminder 5 Hello World</code> (<code>5</code> being the amount of seconds you wish to wait for)</p>

<p>Yes, you can use other commands because of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#sleeping" rel="nofollow noreferrer">nature of asyncio.sleep</a></p>
