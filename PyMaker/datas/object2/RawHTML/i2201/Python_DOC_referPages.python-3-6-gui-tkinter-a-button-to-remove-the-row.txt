<p>i am using python 3, GUI, tkinter.
i use grid method (row and column) to create a table containing info, a button is placed in the end of each row. if someone press that button, the whole row will disappear/destroy and next row will replace it, which function should i use to achieve that?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.effbot.org/tkinterbook/grid.htm#Tkinter.Grid.grid_forget-method" rel="nofollow noreferrer">grid_forget()</a> method will cause the grid geometry manager to stop managing a widget. So if you put your widgets for a row into a frame and grid that, you can grid_forget the frame to have all the widgets in the frame removed from display together. However, you might want to investigate the Ttk <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#treeview" rel="nofollow noreferrer">treeview</a> which can display tabular information or the tktable package (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9348306/291641">this answer</a>).</p>
