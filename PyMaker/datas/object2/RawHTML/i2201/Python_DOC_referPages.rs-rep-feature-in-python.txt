<p>I am relatively new to python and still figuring out stuff. I wanted to check if there is an equivalent of <strong>r's</strong> <strong>rep</strong> command in python to replicate entire vector and not each element. I used numpy.repeat but it only repeats each element given times, is there a way to tweak it to repeat the entire vector?</p>
<p>example:</p>
<pre><code>y=np.repeat(np.arange(0,2),3)
print(y)
array([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1])
</code></pre>
<p>expected output using r's rep</p>
<pre><code> a&lt;-c(0,1)
 rep(a,3)
 0 1 0 1 0 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm no expert in R by any means but as far as I can tell, this is what you are looking for:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; np.tile([0, 1], 3)
array([0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>your expected output is not in python (even though that's what you want) but if i try to translate it basically you want something that transforms lets say <code>[0,1,2]</code>
to <code>[0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2 ...]</code> with any number of repetitions</p>
<p>in python you can simply multiply a list with a number to get that:</p>
<pre><code>lst = [0,1]
lst2  = lst*3
print(lst2)
</code></pre>
<p>this will print <code>[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]</code></p>

<p>Straight from the docs. <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.repeat.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">np.repeat</a> simply repeat the element present in the iterable to the number of times specified in the argument.</p>
<p>Other than what has already been posted is use of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.repeat" rel="nofollow noreferrer">repeat</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain" rel="nofollow noreferrer">chain</a> of itertools</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import repeat, chain
list(chain(*(repeat((1,2),3)))) # [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@PM 2Rings, well i thought the example would clear any doubts, but i have removed string from the title.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring wow just what I needed. Thanks a ton</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring if you can add that as an answer I could accept!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sometimes where a R user solves an issue using<code>rep()</code> a Numpy user would use broadcasting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that's great info, but this doesn't work on numpy arrays, right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no numpy arrays will return an array that has each element multiplied by 3... as i said you didn't say what your expected output in python is so there was no way to know for sure how to answer your question ...</span>
