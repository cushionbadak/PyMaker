<p>I need to save some variables to a file. I can can write to the file but I don't know how to order the contents of the file in python. </p>
<p>The file will contain a string paired with an integer and I want to order it from the highest integer to lowest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data in the file:  </p>
<pre><code>3 third string
1 first string
2 second string
</code></pre>
<p>Expected Output:  </p>
<pre><code>1 first string
2 second string
3 third string
</code></pre>

<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Say if you have your input in a list as below. Then you can use sorted() function and then use the sorted list for writing  the file</p>
<pre><code>    l=['3 third string','1 third string','2 third string']
    l=sorted(l,key=lambda x : int(x[0]))
    with open("A:\mygit\projects\Python\output_dir\sample.txt",'w+') as f:
        for line in l:
            f.write("{}\n".format(line))
</code></pre>
<p>Now say if you have a file containing the dis-ordered set of lines.Now if you want to read and order the same file, say sample.txt looks like as below:</p>
<pre><code>    3 third string
    1 third string
    2 third string
</code></pre>
<p>Now the below code will, first read the file, convert it into a list ,sort it and write back it into the file:</p>
<pre><code>    with open("sample.txt",'r') as f:
        l=[x.strip() for x in list(f)]

    l=sorted(l,key=lambda x : int(x[0]))

    with open("sample.txt",'w') as f:
        for line in l:
            f.write("{}\n".format(line))
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't have to use standard python, take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">json library.</a></p>
<p>Besides this, you can use the builtin <code>sorted()</code> function python has.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Nice of people to downvote without reasoning... but it would help to know some more information. How are you saving the variables to a file (as in what format)? The <code>sorted</code> function can be used to order a list in Python, this may be of use</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>json</code> is part of the standard library. Also, this doesn't actually explain how to apply either method.</span>
