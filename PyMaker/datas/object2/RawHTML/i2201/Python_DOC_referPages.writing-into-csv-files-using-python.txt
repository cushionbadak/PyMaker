<p>Guys I was trying to write into a csv file using python and the code I used for it is as follows</p>
<pre><code>        with open(csvfile,'a') as csv_file:
        writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
        writer.writerow(row)
</code></pre>
<p>so after this when I tried to use this code</p>
<pre><code>with open(filename,'r') as csvfile:
    csvFileReader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in csvFileReader:
        dates.append(int(row[0]))
        prices.append(float(row[1]))
</code></pre>
<p>I get an error as <em>IndexError: list index out of range</em> 
I checked the file and found that there is an empty line created after every write that has been performed. Is that the cause of this error? If so how can I rectify it?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>You can check whether row is empty or not by adding <code>print (row)</code>.<br/>
If you check that row is empty, you can pass it by many ways.<br/>
Such as, <code>if len(row) == 0: continue;</code>.  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Among other things, follow <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#id3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>csv</code> module documentation</a>; both <code>open</code> calls should be passing <code>newline=''</code> to disable line ending translation (so the <code>csv</code> module is the sole arbiter of correct line endings). Per the docs: "If <code>csvfile</code> is a file object, it should be opened with <code>newline=''</code>."</span>
