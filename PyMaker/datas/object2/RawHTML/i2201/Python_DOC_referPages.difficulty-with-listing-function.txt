<p>Write a function named "counting" that takes a list of numbers as a parameter and returns the number of values in the input that are between 29.88 and 48.05 not including these end points. (My code below)</p>
<pre><code>def counting(number):
    sum = 0
    for x in number:
        if (29.88 &lt; x &lt; 48.05):
            sum = sum + x
        return sum
</code></pre>
<p>How do I return the number of values in the input instead of the first number of an input?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>your return statement is indented too deep; you should return it after the for loop. also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=sum#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code></a> is not a good name as it is a built-in function that you overwrite.</p>
<p>and you should add <code>1</code> to the sum (you are counting) and not <code>x</code> itself.</p>
<p>you could also try this using the built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=sum#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sum</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>def counting(number):
    return sum(29.88 &lt; x &lt; 48.05 for x in number)
</code></pre>
<p>(this is actually short for <code>sum(1 for x in number if 29.88 &lt; x &lt; 48.05)</code> and works because <code>True</code> is basically <code>1</code> and <code>False</code> is basically <code>0</code>).</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Or to be similar to yours:</p>
<pre><code>def counting(number):
    c = 0
    for x in number:
        if 29.88 &lt; x &lt; 48.05:
            c += 1
    return c
</code></pre>
<p>Or can do one-liner, <code>len</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def counting(number):
    return len([29.88 &lt; x &lt; 48.05 for x in number])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>filter()</code></a> on your list to keep only elements that the given function evaluates to true.</p>
<pre><code>def counting(number):
    return len(list(filter(lambda x: 29.88 &lt; x &lt; 48.05, number)))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Your <code>return</code> is inside the loop, which will make it return inside one iteration. Outdent it one level so it is outside the for loop. Also, you are not asked for the <i>sum</i> of the numbers, but their <i>count</i>. When you <i>sum</i>, you add the element itself to the cumulative total. What do you add when you <i>count</i>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Append the numbers to a list and return the length of the list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, misread what you did. Correct on all counts (though sum of boolean might be a bit hard for a newbie)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Amadan uff, thanks, spent some time now trying to figure out how i messed up...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@vash_the_stampede <code>number</code> is a list, and therefore should be iterable.</span>
