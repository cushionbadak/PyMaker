<p>I have 1 GB csv file and I can not read that log file and give same error in both python and pandas code in my csv file, it is not a value of more than one column because there is only a single column value and All of my CSV values is number</p>
<pre><code>with open("/Users/kiya/sep_sent.csv", encoding='utf-8') as f:
for i in f: 
   print(i.strip())
</code></pre>
<p>another method:</p>
<pre><code>with open("/Users/kiya/sep_sent.csv",encoding='cp1252') as f:
    for i in f:
      print(i.strip())

<p>You can pass the encoding argument to read_csv as well</p>

<p>Open the file with utf-8 encoding and it should work:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I already tried that that method is not working</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK, now I need the csv file to help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The size of the csv file is 1 GB</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try with somthing smaller .. see my comment below, your terminal is <code>cp1252</code> and in the csv file are utf-8 characters which are not printable in that terminal, now you got this exception only when printing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to figure out which encoding was used to encode the file. Or try <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">other encodings</a> at random. <code>'latin_1'</code> or the <code>'iso8859_XX'</code> variants might work but it woud mean there are control characters in your file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It shows that same error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks like you have non unicode characters in your text. See @Goyo's answer in comments above. To find out where the issue is in the file, you might want to consider chunking up the file into smaller units to identify which unit the problem is in</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually the error message is saying that <code>utf-8</code> doesn't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It shows that same error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK, but now the you get output <code>0</code> before it was <code>b0</code> which was binray zero, now you got string character <code>0</code> .. compare <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/52627668/revisions">stackoverflow.com/posts/52627668/revisions</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">ya but It is not running completely and an error is displayed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems your terminal is using <code>cp1252</code> (see traceback) and in the csv file there are chracters which are not printable on such a codepage.</span>
