<p>I am learning how to code with python using "Learn Python the HARD WAY" 3rd edition.
I am on Exercise 6. Im not having to much trouble although the formatters still have me a tad confused.
I know the formatter %s is used for strings.
But I am confused about when to use others and why to use others
like:%r, %d, %x, etc.....
Any direction would be very much appreciated!</p>

<p><code>%r</code>, <code>%d</code>, <code>%x</code>, <code>%s</code> are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">String formatters</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li><code>%d</code> formatter is used for numbers</li>
<li><code>%s</code> formatter will the string representation of the object (makes use of <code>str()</code>)</li>
<li><code>%r</code> formatter will return the canonical string representation of the object (makes use of <code>repr()</code>)</li>
<li><code>%x</code> is used for signed hexadecimal. The alternate form causes a leading ‘0x’ to be inserted between left-hand padding and the formatting of the number if the leading character of the result is not already a zero.</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">You probably don't need to stress. They are old-style formatters. Just use <code>"Hello {}".format(your_name)</code> and don't worry about the data type. LPTHW has a lot of issues, not least because it seems to have convinced you to start with Python 2 which will be unmaintained after 2020 (note, I followed the course myself)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you Google the phrase "Python format tutorial", you’ll find tutorials that can explain it much better than we can in an answer here.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I wonder why so many people want to learn python the hard way, when there are a lot of easy ways to do so. This book has many flaws. Forget about it.</span>
