<p>Python list to make double quotes around string and pass to API, which requires this to pass as list of double quote string,</p>
<p>API data to pass:</p>
<pre><code>data = {
    "styles" : styleList
}
</code></pre>
<p>it is working when I put manually: </p>
<pre><code>["A123", "B123", "C131", "D231"]
</code></pre>
<p>But not with: </p>
<pre><code>['A123', 'B123', 'C131', 'D231']
</code></pre>
<p>Things tried and not helpful: </p>
<ol>
<li>Append double quotes around string. </li>
</ol>
<pre><code>styleList = ["\"" + style + "\"" for style in styleList]</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Replace single quotes with double quotes. </li>
</ol>
<pre><code>styleList = [style.replace("'","") for style in styleList]</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Dump as JSON.       </li>
</ol>
<pre><code>styleList = json.dumps(styleList)</code></pre>
<p>All are only helpful to print not to pass with API.</p>

<p>You need a string representation of your list.</p>
<p>With <code>styleList = ["\"" + style + "\"" for style in styleList]</code> you create " around the items of your list: <code>['a','b'] --&gt; ['"a"','"b"']</code></p>
<p>Use </p>
<pre><code>data = { "styles" : repr(styleList) }`
</code></pre>
<p><code>repr</code> will create a string representation of your list: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr" rel="nofollow noreferrer">repr()</a></p>
<pre><code>data = [1,2,3,'tata',8.9]

r = repr(data)                      # "[1, 2, 3, 'tata', 8.9]"
</code></pre>
<p>If you need numbers quoted as well, use</p>
<pre><code># convert anything to its string representation
r = repr( [str(e) for e in data] )  # "['1', '2', '3', 'tata', '8.9']"
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">How are you passing data to the api? <code>json.dumps({'styles': styleList})</code> should give you exactly what you want... or, if you're using requests and making a post request, you should be to do: <code>requests.post('some_url', json={'styles': styleList})</code>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suspect this is an XY question and actually the OP doesn't need this at all... in fact - I'm guessing they're looking to pass json data to an api and forcing stuff like this is either unnecessary or will break things...but guess we'll see...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @JonClements, There is issue with API request itself, and it works fine with single quotes also.   Thanks PatrickArtner, This is right way to convert single quotes to double quotes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@rocky but if you're sending JSON data then json.dumps will ensure strings are correctly quoted <i>and</i> escaped for you... (Nested " for instance). You shouldn't have/want to be doing any of this. You should just build a python dict you want to send (your data) and then json.dumps all of it - not the individual bits.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@rocky I second Jon Clements here - especially manually quoting/escaping is dificult to do so, please try Jon Clements suggestions under your question first before handling it yourself. They are safer down the road.</span>
