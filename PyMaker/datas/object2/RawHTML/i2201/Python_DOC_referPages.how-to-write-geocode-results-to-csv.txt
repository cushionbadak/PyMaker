<p>I am trying to use the geocode module and I can't figure out how to write my results to a file.  Below is what I have so far.</p>
<p>How do I write the outputs of that geocode process to the output.csv?</p>
<pre><code>import os

os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "api_key_from_google_cloud_platform"


import csv
import sys
import geocoder

output = '/Users/Username/Documents/Folder/output.csv'

def main(args):
    with open(args, newline='') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
        for row in reader:
            data = [row['AddressLine1'], row['City'], row['State'], row['PostalCode'], row['CountryName']]
            separator = ', '
            joined_address = separator.join(data)
            print(joined_address)

            # Open the output file
            with open(output, 'w') as out:
                writer = csv.writer(out, lineterminator='\n')


            # Geocode them
            g = geocoder.google(joined_address)
            g.housenumber
            g.postal
            g.street
            g.street_long

            # Some kind of writer to my output file goes here?


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main(sys.argv[1])

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should do it (assuming you want the first row to be labels).</p>
<pre><code>writer.writerow(["house_number", "postal", "street", "street_long"])
writer.writerow([g.housenumber, g.postal, g.street, g.street_long])
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You already have the CSV writer. Why don't you use it? Did you read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that you create a new writer for each input row. The code for writing should probably be outside of the <code>for row in reader</code> loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ah good point -- thank you</span>
