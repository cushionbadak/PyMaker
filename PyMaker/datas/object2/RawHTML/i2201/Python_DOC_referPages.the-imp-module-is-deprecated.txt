<p>Whenever I try to use "sklearn" in pycharm, I get the following error on the console.</p>
<p><em>DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see the module's documentation for alternative uses
  import imp</em></p>
<p>I am not sure if it should bother me, because program still working, but it's annoying. How can I get rid of it?</p>
<p>I made every change, people recommended in linked question but the error is still there.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I deleted the code that imports "imp", from "cloudpickle.py" and the warning is gone but I hope I didn't mess up anything. You can also simply ignore this.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The reason is that the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib. In order to fix the warning see the module's documentation for alternative uses.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">See this: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/imp.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/imp.html</a> and this: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is not an error but a warning.  You even write yourself "DeprecationWarning".  Any warning can be ignored.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MERose but it outputs a message and shows to the user and messes up the screen making it difficult to ignore</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And when one see a huge warning sign e.g. red sign ahead, it is not always clever to ignore</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd rather change it to <code>import importlib</code> than delete it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why did you delete?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because I was trying to make the error gone.But I don't think it's the right way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">delete could break other thing, because the interpret might get to: line 936 mod = imp.new_module(name). Fix the module or ignore the error ...</span>
