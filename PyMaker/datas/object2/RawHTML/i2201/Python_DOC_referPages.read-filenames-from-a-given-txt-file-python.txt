<p>I am new to python.</p>
<p>I was trying to write a program that will read files from a .txt file.</p>
<p>(that means I have a 'filenames.txt' file and have filenames with their paths in that file)
How can I read those file names from that .txt file and get the date the file was created?</p>
<p>Heres the code I came up with:</p>
<pre><code>import sys, os
import pathlib

# list of filenames with their paths separated by comma 
file_list = []  

# input file name which contains list of files separated by \n
with open ('filenames.txt' , 'r+' ) as f :
    list_file = f.readlines().splitlines()

input_list = file_list + list_file  

def file_check(input_list):
    if input_list is none:
      print ("input_list is null")

print (input_list)

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>by this you can open a file:</p>
<pre><code>file = open('path/to/filenames.txt')
</code></pre>
<p>assuming data is written one file name per line you can read from your file like this:</p>
<pre><code>filename = file.readline()
</code></pre>
<p>then for knowing the time of creation you can <code>import os</code> and use <code>stat</code> function. this function will tell you <code>st_atime</code> which is last accessed time, <code>st_mtime</code> as last modified time and <code>st_ctime</code> as creation time. take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> :</p>
<pre><code>import os
stat = os.stat(filename)
creation_time = stat.s_ctime
</code></pre>
<p>for ommiting whitespaces at the end of the filenames you can use rstip. 
So, altogether it will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import os
file = open('path/to/filenames.txt')
filename = file.readline()
while filename:
    stat = os.stat(filename.rstrip())
    creation_time = stat.st_ctime
    print(creation_time)
    filename = file.readline()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If they are in this format: [filename] [path] on each line i suggest the following:</p>
<pre><code>f = open('filenames.txt', 'r').read().splitlines()
</code></pre>
<p>This will read from the file and then split it into lines</p>
<pre><code>f = [x.split(' ') for x in f]
</code></pre>
<p>It is a shorten way of iterating over f which is a list of string and then split each string at the space so it will be [filename, path]</p>
<p>Here things get a little bit complicated:</p>
<pre><code>import os
from datetime import datetime
from time import strftime
datetime.fromtimestamp(os.path.getctime('filenames.txt')).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
</code></pre>
<p>All the modules used are builtin</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can check file creation time by using:</p>
<pre><code>import os, time
time.ctime(os.path.getctime('your_full_file_path'))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Need a little more information, what sort of files are listed in that text file? What do you mean by "read"? If they</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can read <a href="https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/cheatsheet/python-file-handling" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>, try to code yourself and ask if you find any errors or unexpected outputs, given no one else have asked a similar question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CapnJack  I have a filenames.txt file that contains bunch of files like follows.  c/users/......... file1.txt c/users/......... file2.txt c/users/......... file3.txt  I want my program to read those files using those file paths and return the number of lines in each file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry got a call while I was trying to edit my accidentally submitted original comment so I can't fix it now. But I mean to ask: can I assume all the files in this text file are other text files?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, All files within the filenames.txt are text files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I really appreciate your help But this is the output coming with your code.  1538435352.7896326  1538176072.1286607  1538494272.3550172</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you want to make the time human readable, you should format it. take a look at the solution here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39359245/from-stat-st-mtime-to-datetime" title="from stat st mtime to datetime">stackoverflow.com/questions/39359245/â€¦</a></span>
