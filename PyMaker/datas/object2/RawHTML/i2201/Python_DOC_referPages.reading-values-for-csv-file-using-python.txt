<p>I am having some problems getting the row values from the CSV file below</p>
<pre><code>CSV
minzoom, maxzoom
0,5
5,10
10,18
</code></pre>
<p>My Code :</p>
<pre><code>i = 0
for line in open("C:/Marine/lookup/distinct_lookup_scales.csv"):
    i = i + 1
    if (i &gt; 1):  #Skip header
        print("Line: " + line)
        #csv_row = line.split(',')
        minzoom = str(line[0])
        maxzoom = str(line[2])
        print("Minzoom:" + minzoom)
        print("Maxzoom:" + maxzoom)
        readShpFile(minzoom, maxzoom)
</code></pre>
<p>The values returned for <strong>minzoom</strong> and <strong>maxzoom</strong> has been</p>
<pre><code>0   5
5   1
1   ,
</code></pre>
<p>I had used line split but reverted to trying to get items from the line
Not sure if that was the best approach</p>

<p>That is not how you should read the csv file.
Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv module documentation</a>.</p>
<p>One example : </p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('C:/Marine/lookup/distinct_lookup_scales.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    csvreader.next() #skip header
    for row in csvreader:
        minzoom = int(row[0])
        maxzoom = int(row[1])
        print('minzoom : {}'.format(minzoom))
        print('maxzoom : {}'.format(maxzoom))
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use a DictReader which will use your header line to yield dictionaries.</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('C:/Marine/lookup/distinct_lookup_scales.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
    csvreader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    for row in csvreader:
        minzoom = int(row['minzoom'])
        maxzoom = int(row['maxzoom'])
        print('minzoom : {}'.format(minzoom))
        print('maxzoom : {}'.format(maxzoom))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try numpy.genfromtxt, like:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

data = np.genfromtxt("C:/Marine/lookup/distinct_lookup_scales.csv", delimiter = ",",
                     skip_header = 1)
minzooms = data[:,0]
maxzooms = data[:,1]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What you're reading from csv is a string. Indexing won't work. Split will be a good approach. If you have issues with it, post the output or the issue, or both.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you considered using the csv module for this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>minzoom, maxzoom = line.split(',')</code>?  Indexing doesn't work, as the zoom can be more than 10 which means you need two characters instead of one and you' may need to shift the max zoom location.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why don't you directly use pandas data frame's read_csv method?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Corentin!. I tried the first way above and the readShpFile method now works as expected!. Thank you so much! Dave</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks also Corentin for the CSV module documentation link, Much appreciated!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Y.Wang. Not used numpy before as I am new to python but will give the approach a try. Dave</span>
