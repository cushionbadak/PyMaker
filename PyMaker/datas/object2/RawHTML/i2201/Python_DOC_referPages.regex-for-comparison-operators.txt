<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I apologize for having to ask this and I suspect it's trivially simple to anyone even faintly familiar with regexes. I have a string that's always of the form: <code>comparison_operator integer</code>:</p>
<p>So for example <code>'&gt;2:'</code> or <code>'&lt;=0:'</code>. </p>
<p>I would like to just separate out the comparison operator and the number, but I have been unable to find a clear explanation on how to do this. Any help gratefully received. I'm using Python's <strong>'re'</strong> module although to my understanding regexes are more-or-less language independent.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>[&lt;&gt;]=?|==</code> to match the operator, and <code>\d+</code> to match the number. Enclosing each of those patterns in a <a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/brackets.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">capture group</a> will let you access the matched values:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(r'([&lt;&gt;]=?|==)(\d+)', '&gt;2:').groups()
('&gt;', '2')
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.match(r'([&lt;&gt;]=?|==)(\d+)', '&lt;=0:').groups()
('&lt;=', '0')
</code></pre>
<p>You can also unpack the matched groups into individual variables:</p>
<pre><code>match = re.match(r'([&lt;&gt;]=?|==)(\d+)', your_input)
operator, number = match.groups()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why aren't <i>you</i> faintly familiar with regex yet? Have you tried to come up with a regex?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CertainPerformance, Point taken, maybe, but I have actually looked around a fair amount for the solution to this - of the tabs I still have open: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2343938/how-to-match-comparison-operators-in-regex" title="how to match comparison operators in regex">stackoverflow.com/questions/2343938/â€¦</a> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/re.html</a>  But the topic of regexes (as with any other programming topic) is a relatively complex one, the answers are not always obvious and I feel the question is still legitimate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead of looking for a solution for this exact problem (which may or may not exist, somewhere, in a format usable for you), why not try to come up with a solution yourself? Based on what you've posted here, it should be pretty trivial.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aran-Fey, Yes! Here's a number of my failed attempts: ipdb&gt; re.search('&gt;&lt;=',item[0]) ipdb&gt; re.search('(&lt;&gt;=)',item[0]) ipdb&gt; re.search('=',item[0]) &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 1), match='='&gt; ipdb&gt; re.search('(&lt;[=&gt;]?|==|&gt;=?|\&amp;\&amp;|\|\|)',item[0]) ipdb&gt; re.search('[&lt;&gt;=]',item[0]) &lt;_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 1), match='='&gt; ipdb&gt; re.search('&lt;[=&gt;]?|==|&gt;=?|\&amp;\&amp;|\|\|',item[0]) ipdb&gt; re.search('(&lt;[=&gt;]?|=|&gt;=?)\s\d+', item[0]) ipdb&gt; re.search('(&lt;,&gt;,=)', item[0]) ipdb&gt; re.search('^(\s*[a-zA-Z0-9_+\-\/* ]+\s*(&gt;=|&lt;=|&gt;|&lt;|==|!=)\s*[a-zA-Z0-9_+\-\/* ]+\s*)$',item[0])</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks - that works great.</span>
