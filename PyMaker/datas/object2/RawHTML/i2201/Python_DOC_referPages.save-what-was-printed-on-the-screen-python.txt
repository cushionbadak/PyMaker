<p>Is there any way to save into a variable what that was print on the screen, so I will be able to print it back after erasing the screen?</p>

<p>Don't know why this question is being downvoted. Anyway, an answer from <a href="https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1030160198600548352" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Raymond Hettinger on Twitter</a>, utilises <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.redirect_stdout" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>contextlib.redirect_stdout()</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>with open('help.txt', 'w') as f:
    with contextlib.redirect_stdout(f):
        help(pow)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Although, in this case the output is being redirected into a file, rather than a variable and is Python3, not 2.7.</p>
<p>From the docs, to capture that in a variable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, the output of help() normally is sent to sys.stdout. You can capture that output in a string by redirecting the output to an <code>io.StringIO</code> object:</p>
<pre><code>f = io.StringIO()
with redirect_stdout(f):
    help(pow)
s = f.getvalue()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">If you are printing on the screen, you should already have it stored. Can you specify where is the information on the screen from?</span>
