<p>I'm trying to convert map to list, but it's returned <code>TypeError: 'int' object is not callable</code>.. can someone explain to me?</p>
<pre><code>n = int(input())
arr = list(map(n, input().split()))
for i in arr:
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>Error:</p>
<pre><code>arr = list(map(n, input().split()))
TypeError: 'int' object is not callable
</code></pre>

<p>The map function in Python accepts the first argument as a callable function and the second as an iterable. Each item in the iterable is then passed through the function into an output <code>map</code> object.</p>
<p>In your example, <code>n</code> is defined as an <code>int</code> pulled from the Stdin (input) due to the line <code>n = int(input())</code>. Therefore, the code above is equivalent to the following:</p>
<pre><code>n = int(input())
out = []

for element in input().split():
    out.append( n(element) )
</code></pre>
<p>This code won't run because <code>n</code> (as an <code>int</code>) cannot be called as a function.</p>
<p>If what you are trying to do is convert input like <code>0 2 45 119</code> to a list of integers, you can pass the first argument of <code>map</code> as <code>int</code>, and <code>int</code> will be called on every element of the input provided.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">oh.. i see. but, how to add the range of the map? i use "n" as the first argument to give the range of map</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EzraLazuardy what makes you think you need to provide a range to the map function? Doku: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map</a></span>
