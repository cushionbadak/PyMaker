<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have two separate lists of users (a person's name) and email addresses.  How do I modify this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>message = """To: </p>
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>How is the weather?"""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to print without changing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>print(message)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically I'm looking for it to print out something similar to this without modifying the print(message). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To: bob@gmail.com</p>
<p>Hey, Bob</p>
<p>How is the weather?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sorry if this sounds dumb, but I feel like I'm just beating my head against a wall here and cannot figure it out.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>str.format()</code> as a means of string interpolation.</p>
<pre><code>email = "bob@gmail.com"
name = "Bob"

message = """To: {}
From: {}
How's the weather""".format(email, name)

print(message)
</code></pre>
<p>The above code will output:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To: bob@gmail.com</p>
<p>From: Bob</p>
<p>How's the weather</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is one way of achieving the desired result</p>
<pre><code>email = "bob@gmail.com"
user = "Bob"

message = """To: {} \nFrom: {} \nHow is the weather?""".format(email, name)

print(message)

To: bob@gmail.com 
From: Bob 
How is the weather?
</code></pre>
<p>But I think you may be interested in the <code>input</code> function that creates a text box and you fill it. Here is how it works.</p>
<pre><code>input('Do you want to write a message? : ')
input('Tell us who is receiving the message: ')
input('Now write your message in this box: ')
</code></pre>
<p>Here are the answers that I put in ['Yes', 'John', 'Hi John, this is Samuel Nde.']. The output is below.</p>
<pre><code>Do you want to write a message? : Yes
Tell us who is receiving the message: John
Now write your message in this box: Hi John, This is Samuel Nde.
'Hi John, This is Samuel Nde.'
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Start by familiarizing yourself with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.format()</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can google for string formatting: <code>'To: {}'.format(name)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK I tried it and got this as an error: ERROR:root:An unexpected error occurred while tokenizing input The following traceback may be corrupted or invalid The error message is: ('EOF in multi-line string', (1, 19))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It sounds like you are reading some kind of input from a file or the command line for your email and name variables. Could you post the code you are using to do that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok I think I've got it now, thank you for the help!</span>
