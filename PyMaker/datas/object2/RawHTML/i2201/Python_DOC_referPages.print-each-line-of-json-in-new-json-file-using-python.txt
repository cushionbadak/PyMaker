<p>I have a <code>json</code> file; I need to remove the <code>id</code> key from the content, which I can do with my code.</p>
<p>Now I want to print each line of the <code>json</code> file in a new file and use the name filed in my <code>json</code> for the file name.</p>
<p>My <code>json</code> file ex:</p>
<pre><code>{"categories":["Test"],"indications":[{"@class":"=indication.BuildLogIndication","pattern":".*TypeError .*"},{"@class":"model.indication.BuildLogIndication","pattern":".*LoadError .*"}],"modifications":[{"time":{"$date":"2015-10-08T20:01:54.075Z"}},{"user":"user1","time":{"$date":"2015-03-04T18:38:58.123Z"}},{"user":"user2","time":{"$date":"2014-11-13T01:54:13.906Z"}},{"time":{"$date":"2014-09-02T18:48:05.000Z"}}],"lastOccurred":{"$date":"2017-01-25T20:05:17.180Z"}}
{"pattern":".*look for this string.*"}],"modifications":[{"time":{"$date":"2014-09-02T18:52:20.000Z"}}],"lastOccurred":{"$date":"2014-11-04T00:43:32.945Z"},"_removed":{"timestamp":{"$date":"2014-11-13T01:52:44.346Z"},"by":"user3"},"active":false}
</code></pre>
<p>Code for removing id:</p>
<pre><code>import json
import sys
import re
import fileinput

infile = "failure.json"
outfile = "failure1.json"

fin = open(infile)
fout = open(outfile, "w+")
for line in fin:
    for word in line:
        line = re.sub("\"_id.*?},","", line)
    fout.write(line)
    file.write("%d\n" % n)
fin.close()
fout.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You sample input show a <code>json</code> object on each line.</p>
<p>So my solution reads each line and converts it to a <code>python</code> <code>dict</code> (using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.loads" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json.loads()</code></a>), removes the desired key from the <code>dict</code> (using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.pop" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dict.pop()</code></a> to fail silently if the key is not present) and converts it back to a string (using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dumps" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json.dumps()</code></a>), which is then written to the new file.</p>
<pre><code>import json

infile = "failure.json"
outfile = "failure1.json"
key = '_id'

with open(infile) as f_read:
    with open(outfile, 'w') as f_write:
        for line in f_read:
            line = line.strip()
            if len(line) &gt; 0:
                try:
                    elem = json.loads(line)
                    elem.pop(key, None)
                    f_write.write('{}\n'.format(json.dumps(elem)))
                except json.JSONDecodeError:
                    pass
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>EDIT: apparently each <code>json</code> line should go into a separate new file, according to OPs comments. That could be done like this, for example:</p>
<pre><code>import json

infile = "failure.json"
key_to_remove = '_id'

with open(infile) as f_read:
    for line in f_read:
        line = line.strip()
        if len(line) &gt; 0:
            try:
                elem = json.loads(line)
                elem.pop(key_to_remove, None)

                outfile = '{}.json'.format(elem['name'])      # this may raise KeyError
                with open(outfile, 'w') as f_write:
                    f_write.write('{}\n'.format(json.dumps(elem)))
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                pass

<p>For deletion you could use something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import json
import sys
import re
import fileinput

with open('failure.json') as data_file:
    data = json.load(data_file)
    del data['_id']


with open('failure2.json', 'w') as data_file:
    data = json.dump(data, data_file)
</code></pre>
<p>and in order to create file with id value, just parse <code>data</code> object, and value of <code>id</code> node</p>

<p>You've imported the <code>json</code> package, but you're not using it. You should, it's great.</p>
<p>Get your string from file and then use <code>json.loads()</code> to load the string into a json object. From there, you can get each element of the json object with <code>for key in json_object</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you but I want to print each line of the json file in a new file and use the name filed in my json for the file name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">which key in the json data contains the new file name?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">name &gt;&gt; "name":"Ruby"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JanTamm I updated my answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, quick question, how we can check for special character in name field like '/' and  replace them with ' _' before generating the file? Thanks in advance</span>
