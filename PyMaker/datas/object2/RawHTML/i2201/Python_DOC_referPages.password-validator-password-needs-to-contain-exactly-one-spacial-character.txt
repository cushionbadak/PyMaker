<pre><code>Task: Password validator
a. The length of the password needs to be from 8 to 30 characters.
b. The password needs to contain at least 2 uppercase characters.
c. The password needs to contain at least 2 lowercase characters.
d. The password needs to contain at least 1 digit.
e. The password needs to contain exactly 1, but not more of the following special characters:
@/%&amp;*_-
</code></pre>
<p>This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>special_character_set = "@/%&amp;*_-"
is_valid = False
import re
while True:
    password = input("please enter a password: ")
    if len(password) &gt; 30 or len(password)&lt; 8:
        print("The length of the password needs to be from 8 to 30 characters!")
        continue
    elif re.search('[0-9]', password) is None:
        print("The password needs to contain at least 1 digit!")
        continue
    elif re.search ('[A-Z][A-Z]', password) is None:
        print("The password needs to contain at least 2 uppercase characters!")
        continue
    elif re.search('[a-z][a-z]', password) is None:
        print("The password needs to contain at least 2 lowercase characters!")
        continue
    elif re.search('[@/%&amp;*_-]', password) is None:
        print("The password needs to contain one of the following special characters: @/%&amp;*_-!")
        continue
    else:
        is_valid = True
    if is_valid:
        print("valid password")
        break
</code></pre>
<p>It works. However, the condition e) has not been completely fulfilled. How can I make the password contain ONLY ONE of the special characters?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What about <code>len</code> + <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.findall()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>...
elif len(re.findall('[@/%&amp;*_-]', password)) != 1:
    # Some number of special characters other than 1 was found
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>...
elif len(re.findall('[@/%&amp;*_-]', password)) == 0:
    # No special characters were found
    ...
elif len(re.findall('[@/%&amp;*_-]', password)) &gt; 1:
    # Too many special characters were found
</code></pre>
<p>(and if you do the latter, try not to run the regex twice)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Don't use regex for this; add up the counts of special characters in the proposed password:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; passwd = "My_Pass@"
&gt;&gt;&gt; special = '[@/%&amp;*_-]'
&gt;&gt;&gt; special_count = sum(passwd.count(c) for c in special)
&gt;&gt;&gt; special_count
2
</code></pre>
<p>You can now use <code>special_count</code> as desired.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have to use <code>re</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A couple things: you don't use <code>special_character_set</code> anywhere. Your validator will (incorrectly) reject the passwords <code>AaAaaaaaaa1!</code> and <code>aAAAAAAAAa1!</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could search for any of the characters and if more than one result comes back that's too many. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b><code>re.findall</code></b></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just tried it. works perfectly. Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you a lot!</span>
