<p>I am new to python and programming. Starting to try few things for my project..</p>
<p>My problem is as below</p>
<pre><code>p=subprocess.Popen(Some command which gives me output],stdout=subprocess.PIPE,stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
p.wait()
content=p.stdout.readlines()
for line in content:
    filedata=line.lstrip().rstrip()
</code></pre>
<p>-----&gt; <strong>I want this filedata output to open and save it to a file.</strong></p>
<p>If i use print filedata it works and gives me exactly what i wanted but i donot want to print and wanted to use this data later.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance..</p>

<p>You can do that in following two ways. </p>
<p>Option one uses more traditional way of file handling, I have used with statement, using with statement you don't have to worry about closing the file</p>
<p>Option two, which makes use of pathlib module and this is new in version 3.4 (I recommend using this)</p>
<p>somefile.txt is the full file path in file system. I've also included documentation links and I highly recommend going through those.</p>

<p>OPTION ONE</p>

    with open('somefile.txt', 'a') as file:
        file.write(filedata + '\n')

<span class="comment-copy">Please take a moment to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help#comment-formatting">format</a> your code, and possibly provide us with a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">what kind of file to which you wanted to save?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I wanted it to be a text file, Sorry about the formatting. I am trying to copy properly but it dint work as expected. ===================================================  p=subprocess.Popen(cmd output), stdout=subprocess.PIPE,stderr=subprocess.STDOUT) p.wait() content=p.stdout.readlines() for line in content:     filedata=line.lstrip().rstrip() ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ the filedata need to be written to a text file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hello Sulabh, I did try the same and it dint work earlier.. now it works.. Unsure of what mistake I did earlier.. Thanks again however I have another query. The data is formatted properly when I printed but the same is not when output to file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">which option did you use ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I used the first one in your example..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, I assume that, you want to write each time on a newline. If that's the formatting issue, change file.write(filedata) to file.write(filedata + '\n'). I've update the answer accordingly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. I did that but in general, when we print, the output is correct and the same way it should dump to the file.. may be I am wrong. Also, If i use 'w' instead of 'a' also the data is not dumped to file.</span>
