<p>Really sorry for my novice question.</p>
<p>I am trying to install a module in python for neo4j but I got an error.</p>
<p>here is the import : </p>
<pre><code>from scripts.vis import vis_network
from scripts.vis import draw
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the error:</p>
<pre><code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scripts'
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried "pip install scripts"</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p><code>ModuleNotFoundError</code> simply means the Python interpreter couldn't find the module. I suggest that you read about python modules and packaging <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>I have looked at the source code you pointed to and it works perfectly fine. I suspect your paths are not well set up.</p>
<p>Make sure that in you are running importing <code>scripts.vis</code> in <code>app.py</code>, the directory structure looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>./scripts
    ./scripts/__init__.py
    ./scripts/vis.py
    ....
./app.py #in app.py, you can import as 'from scripts.vis import x'
</code></pre>
<p>Here's what it looks on my system:</p>

<p><code>app.py</code> is successfully able to make the import from <code>vis</code> sub-module. You can use a IPython notebook, that should work fine too.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How did you install this script? <code>pip install</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have tried pip install script but it is not working</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is for neo4j</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I get the module from this code  <a href="http://nicolewhite.github.io/neo4j-jupyter/twitter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">nicolewhite.github.io/neo4j-jupyter/twitter.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">please I cannot make it . can you show me an example .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am using jupyter notebook</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've updated my answer. Yes, as long as you maintain the directory hierarchy, it works in IPynb as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have tried :  from vis import draw but it is not working</span>
