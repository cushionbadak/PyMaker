<p>I do not understand what this is exactly saying: <code>a.lower() == x and b.lower() == rules[x]:</code></p>

<p>I get the a.lower() == x part, but what exactly is the b.lower() == rules[x], specifically what <code>rules[x]</code>is saying?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Let's have a detailled look.</p>
<pre><code>for x in rules:
</code></pre>
<p>What are all the <code>x</code> in <code>rules</code> ? You have <code>x = "rock"</code>, <code>x = "scissors"</code> and <code>x = "papers"</code>.</p>
<p><code>rules</code> is a <code>dict</code>, so there are keys and values in it. For example, it has the value <code>"scissors"</code> attached to the key <code>"rock"</code>, so <code>rules["rock"] == "scissors"</code>.</p>
<pre><code>    if a.lower() == x and b.lower() == rules[x]:
        return 'Player one wins'
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, we are here checking if the player <code>a</code> gets a key with as value what the player <code>b</code> have (in our example, it would be <code>a</code> gets <code>"rock"</code> and <code>b</code> gets <code>"scissors"</code>.</p>
<p>If so, player <code>a</code> wins.</p>

<p>You really need to learn more about dictionaries though, because this is more than essential. Check on <a href="https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/dictionary/how-to-use-dictionaries-in-python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> to learn basics of <code>dict</code> objects.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yeah I should brush up on that. I get it now, it just flew right over my head and I couldn't think logically about it, but you clarified it. Thank you.</span>
