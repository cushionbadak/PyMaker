<p>This is a two part question.
I have a list that will have one item in the list</p>
<pre><code>listA=["12345"]
</code></pre>
<p>i want to use the item in this list for my postgres look up. the code looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>cur.execute("SELECT DISTINCT first_name, actor_id FROM actor t WHERE  actor_id = 'listA'")
</code></pre>
<p>I want to call the number "12345" in my list but postgres gets confused if you dont have '  ' around the number. Even if I leave the '  ' out I still need to have the quotes around the whole statement. How can I get this to work when i need quotes? I think the proper name is nested quotes.</p>
<p>there are other points in time that i want to reference a list but the quote marks always come into play and stop this from happening. other times there will be multiple variable in the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Typically when adding in variables to my queries I will use the .format() function. </p>
<pre><code>list = [12345]
query = ""SELECT DISTINCT first_name, actor_id FROM actor t WHERE  actor_id = '{0}'"
query = query.format(list[0])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">that seems to solve the first portion of my issue but when I'm not using postgres is there a way to use a list when quotes are needed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that would be specific to the library and database that you choose to use</span>
