<p>I have looked up this and not found anything usefule
So I want to take a unknown number (1-26) and convert it to its corrosponding letter.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>import random
rand_let = random.randint(1,26)
print(rand_let)
#Insert the numb letter converter here
print(rand_let) # This is the changed version
output: 
3
C
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>chr()</code> is your converter function. There is an offset of 64, as the numbers to be used are from the ASCII table of characters (i.e.: A = 65, B = 66, ...):</p>
<pre><code># import random
# rand_let = random.randint(1,26)
# print(rand_let)
rand_let = chr(rand_let + 64)
# print(rand_let) # This is the changed version
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One way you could solve this problem is by making a bunch of if thens like so:</p>
<pre><code>if rand_let == 1:
    print("A")
</code></pre>
<p>Another simple way is to make a list of letters and then ask for the letter with a rand_let - 1 index (because the 1st thing in a list has an index of 0.</p>
<pre><code>LetterList = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", and so on...]
letter = LetterList[rand_let-1]
print(letter)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are a couple ways to do this. First you can create a dictionary and assign letters as numbers. another way would be to find the chr() code number then use a random number generater to pick a char num. This is what I recommend.</p>
<pre><code># imports
import random
# pick a random number between the ord of 'a' and the ord of 'z' Google these for 
# more info
pick = random.randint(ord('a'), ord('z'))
# print the char of the ord of the random number picked
print(chr(pick))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">let me look at that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">At first that seems like the opposite of this question, but the accepted answer explains how to do it in both directions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I took a look at that  Ill try using it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I took a look and I will be using that, thank you for showing me that post as I did not know how the ASCII table worked</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you don't need the random number for anything else: <code>random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase)</code>.</span>
