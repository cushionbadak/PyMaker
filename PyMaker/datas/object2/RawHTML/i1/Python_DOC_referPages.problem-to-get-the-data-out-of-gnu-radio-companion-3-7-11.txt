<p>First, I have to say that I'm a noobie posting at this site. </p>
<p>I have written this post because I'm trying to detect signals in the 2.4GHz band. For that, I'm using GNU Radio Companion with this result that worked for me:</p>
<p><img alt="IMG: Simple program that detect the 2.4GHz frequency band" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2mGQu.png"/></p>
<p>But I want to get the information to a python script to work with it. </p>
<p>I was looking for something that can help me to make that possible and I found this tutorial: <a href="http://recolog.blogspot.com/2015/08/processing-data-out-of-gnuradio.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://recolog.blogspot.com/2015/08/processing-data-out-of-gnuradio.html</a></p>
<p>I tried to replicated it but I have this problem:</p>
<p><img alt="IMG: Tutorial Flow graph with error" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtnaK.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="IMG: Error description" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PxaCg.png"/></p>
<p>I have been searching for hours and I found this problem is caused by the version of the GNU Radio (in my case, 3.7.11), but I can't install a previous version because it cause troubles between other packages that I need. </p>
<p>So the question is, How can I replicate the tutorial in my current version?</p>

<p><strong>the red tipped arrow indicate that the data format on either ends (output of a block to input of a block) are incompatible for connection.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Possible solution</em></strong></p>
<p>The easiest method is to use a <kbd>file sink </kbd> block in gnuradio-companion</p>
<p>The <kbd>file sink </kbd> block allows you to write into any format.</p>
<p>You can later take this file and analyse for detecting</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That pad is a pad for a hierarchical block; I'm not sure what you intended the Pad Sink to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In the tutorial is used to get the data and use them in a python script to work with, do you know another way to extract the data and use them in a python script?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you link to that tutorial? Sounds wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is the tutorial: <a href="http://recolog.blogspot.com/2015/08/processing-data-out-of-gnuradio.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">recolog.blogspot.com/2015/08/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know what they're doing, but a pad sink there doesn't make any sense. So, use the <a href="https://tutorials.gnuradio.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official GNU Radio tutorials</a>. Also don't use WX GUI but QT GUI – we've deprecated WX <i>a long time ago</i>, and we've removed it completely from the upcoming release.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I will try this solution later. I will say how it has gone.</span>
