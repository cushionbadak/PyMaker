<p>I am working on a classifier using SVM. But I can't import pandas and sklearn modules. numpy and matplotlib.pyplot can be imported successfully however. The script saved in htdocs of XAMPP. Things I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anaconda installed completely. pandas and sklearn is listed in packages list. (I also created another environment for python 3.7, since I have both python 2.x and 3.x. Both of them contain pandas and sklearn).</li>
<li>pandas and sklearn can be imported in terminal for both version.</li>
<li><em>#!/usr/bin/env python</em> is included. Browser execute my script without any issues except pandas import problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try adding</p>
<pre><code>import sys
print(sys.path)
</code></pre>
<p>and confirm pandas is there in one of those places</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried to add the package path as "sys.path.insert(0, "/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages")". After that, the Pandas is able to be imported, but when I run method inside pandas, it returned more errors. For example if I run "df=pd.read_sql('Query', con=mydb)", it returned "df undefined, pd = &lt;module 'pandas' from '/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pandas/__init__.pyc'&gt;, pd.read_sql = &lt;function read_sql&gt;, con undefined, mydb = &lt;mysql.connector.connection_cext.CMySQLConnection object&gt;" AND much more error message regarding the method itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the suggestion. I printed the path out. Not finding out Pandas and even Numpy. But I am sure numpy imported successfully.</span>
