<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to transform a folder of text documents in the following format:</p>
<p><code>texts = ['text of document 1', 'text of document 2', 'text of document 3',...]</code></p>
<p>in order to apply text mining methods. </p>
<p>So far my code is the following:</p>
<pre><code>import os
file= "*.txt"
path = "C:\\"
texts=[]

for files in os.listdir(path):
     with open(path + files) as f:
         for x in f:
             texts.append(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, the outcome differs from the wanted one:</p>
<pre><code>texts = ['line 1 of document 1', 'line 2 of document 1', â€¦]
</code></pre>
<p>What am I doing wrongly? Can anybody suggest an improvement for my code? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>for line in file:</code> (or in your case, <code>for x in f:</code>) iterates over the lines in a file.</p>
<p>Use the <code>.read()</code> method instead. That will read the entire file into a string:</p>
<pre><code>for files in os.listdir(path):
     with open(path + files) as f:
         texts.append(f.read())
</code></pre>
<p>Edit: I just saw your comment about empty entries. If your directory contains empty files, you can prevent them from being added:</p>
<pre><code>for files in os.listdir(path):
     with open(path + files) as f:
         contents = f.read()
         if contents.strip(): # will also remove files that contain only whitespace
             texts.append(f.read())
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want to read all the txt files in a folder and store their content in a list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I already used f.read(), but then the list has empty entries: texts = ['','','',...]</span>
