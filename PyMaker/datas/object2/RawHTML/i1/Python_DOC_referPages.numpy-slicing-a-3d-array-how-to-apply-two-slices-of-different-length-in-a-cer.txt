<p>I have been stuck with a question about slicing numpy array for a while.</p>
<p>Below is an array I have right now:</p>
<pre><code>a = np.array([[[ 1,  2],
               [ 3,  4],
               [ 5,  6]],
              [[ 7,  8],
               [ 9, 10],
               [11, 12]]]
</code></pre>
<p>How can I use slicing to get an array like the following?</p>
<pre><code>np.array([[[ 1,  2]],
          [[ 9, 10],
           [11, 12]]]
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried <code>a[[0,1],[0,[1,2]]</code> however it didn't work and gave an error:
<code>ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.</code></p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The exact thing you give as your desired output is not possible, since arrays have to be "hyper-rectangles", so <code>X[0].shape</code> has to be the same as <code>X[1].shape</code>.</p>
<p>What you can do is:</p>
<pre><code>a[[0,1,1],[0,1,2]]
# array([[ 1,  2],
#        [ 9, 10],
#        [11, 12]])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do this, for example:    </p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
a = np.array([[[ 1,  2], [ 3,  4], [ 5,  6]], [[ 7,  8], [ 9, 10], [11, 12]]])



print(np.array([[a[0, 0 ,: ],  a[1, 1 ,:], a[1, 2 ,: ]]]))
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code>[[[ 1  2]
 [ 9 10]
 [11 12]]]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can apply two operations separably and merge them afterwards:</p>
<pre><code>np.array((a[0,0:1].tolist(), a[1,1:].tolist()))
# array([[[1, 2]], [[9, 10], [11, 12]]], dtype=object)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I dont understand any pattern on what rows you want returned so I'm going to err on the side of this not being possible in a general case</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your result block will be a 1d 2 element array, containing a (1,2) and (2,2) array (or lists).  You just have to take the two slices separately.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hpaulj That's kind of what I thought. Thank you though!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your answer. Accepted this since this works for me and was the earliest one.</span>
