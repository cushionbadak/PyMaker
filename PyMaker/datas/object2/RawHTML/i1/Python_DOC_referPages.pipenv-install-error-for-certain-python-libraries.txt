<p>My python project depends on a module named levenshtein which is best installed using</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install python3-levenshtein
</code></pre>
<p>I generally use pipenv for all my projects but running below command fails in this case:</p>
<pre><code>pipenv install levenshtein
</code></pre>
<p>This causes issues in smooth production deployment. How do I get pipenv to install this/such libraries?</p>
<p>Note - However, install other libraries (such as flask) succeeds using pipenv install using same method. </p>

Instead, paste the code as text directly into your question. If you select it and click the <code>{}</code> button or Ctrl+K the code block will be indented by four spaces, which will cause it to be rendered as code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I didn't know this, but realize the importance now that you mention. Shall certainly take care next time @Chris.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thats correct. Your commands works on this specific example. However, how to make it work for other similar libraries such as opencv? Using pipenv install python3-opencv or pipenv install python-opencv or pipenv install python3-opencv2 or pipenv install python-opencv2 or pipenv install cv2 gives an error!!!</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@Chris - This link is useful. After going through the link, I used  "pipenv install opencv-python" and finally got it to work. Thanks.</span>
