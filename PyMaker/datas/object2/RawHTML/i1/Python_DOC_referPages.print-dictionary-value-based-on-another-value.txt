<p>How to print the string of "value" only for id: "resolution" ??</p>
<p>Here in this case I want to print the value "Fixed"</p>
<pre><code>customFields: {
 string: [
 {
 id: "device_type",
 value: "iPhone 6"
 },
 {
 id: "os_version",
 value: "iOS 10.x"
 },
 {
 id: "rabbit_build",
 value: "2.11.llyu"
 },
 {
 id: "resolution",
 value: "Fixed"
 },
</code></pre>
<p>My Python code is </p>
<pre><code>for ib in data['documents']:
sid = ib['id']
tit = ib['title']
stat = ib['status']
nstep = ib['next_step']['action']
requester = ib['requesterIdentity']
resolution = ib['customFields']['string']
print(sid, tit, stat, nstep, requester, resolution)
</code></pre>
<p>The output prints all the ids and values rather I want to print "value" only of id: "resolution"</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your present code don't do what you want because you are storing in a new variable called "resolution" the whole list in ib['customField']['string'] and print the value of this new variable.  (what is 'ib' ?)</p>
<p>There is no relation whatsoever between the name of this new variable and the behavior of the '=' operator.</p>
<p>You are trying to grab a specific element of the list, check if the 'id' contains 'resolution' then print it.</p>
<p>you can use </p>
<pre><code>resolutionList = [it for it in ib['customFields']['string'] if it['id'] == 'resolution']
for element in resolutionList :
  print(element['value'])
</code></pre>
<p>or (in one line)</p>
<pre><code>print(*[it['value'] for it in ib['customFields']['string'] if it['id'] == 'resolution'])
</code></pre>
<p>The * operator is used to deplete the list (print(*[a,b]) &lt;=&gt; print(a,b))</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is pretty straightforward, but should work:</p>
<pre><code>for ib in data['documents']:
    sid = ib['id']
    tit = ib['title']
    stat = ib['status']
    nstep = ib['next_step']['action']
    requester = ib['requesterIdentity']
    for item in ib['customFields']['string']:
        if item['id'] == "resolution":
           resolution = item['string']
</code></pre>
<p>Sure, since "string" is a list of dictionaries you can't get specific values without looping through all dictionaries of this list. I'd also recommend you to change this list into a dictionary, so your json structure will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>string: {
 "device_type": iPhone 6".
 "os_version": "iOS 10.x",
 "rabbit_build": "2.11.llyu",
 "resolution": "Fixed",
 }
</code></pre>
<p>With this kind of structure you could check all the values without loops by straightly getting value of "resolution" key</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Invalid <code>dict</code> syntax for Python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please don't change your whole question so heavily after people already answered, you should have use comments to correct yourself. This makes your post hardly understandable for future references / searches.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes you did and asked people to check your updated python code which is not actual python code and you forgot to define <code>data</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when the resolution is printed, it should be displayed with other loop values</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no need to edit my answer, simply replace ib['customFields']['string'] in my syntax by the variable name i.e. resolution</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"when the resolution is printed, it should be displayed with other loop values"  this doesn't mean anything</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How can make change when it is already in a loop?        <code>for ib in data['documents']:      sid = ib['id']      tit = ib['title']      stat = ib['status']      nstep = ib['next_step']['action']      requester = ib['requesterIdentity']      resolution = ib['customFields']['string']      print(sid, tit, stat, nstep, requester, resolution)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Check my latest update in question section which already runs in a loop. Is it possible to add another loop within a loop and print along with?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">edited my answer, yeah, you just add one more loop to to through "string" list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you let me know how to code that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">did my best to explain what's going on</span>
