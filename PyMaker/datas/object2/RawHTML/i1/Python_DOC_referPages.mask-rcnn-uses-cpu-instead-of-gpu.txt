<p>I'm using the Mask RCNN library which is based on tenserflow and I can't seem to get it to run on my GPU (1080TI). The inference time is 4-5 seconds, during which I see a usage spike on my cpu but not my gpu. Any possible fixes for this?</p>

<p>It is either because that GPU_COUNT is set to 0 in <code>config.py</code> or you don't have <code>tensorflow-gpu</code> installed (which is required for tensorflow to run on GPU)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I've already checked that GPU_COUNT is set to 1 and I had installed tensorflow-gpu but maybe it's not picking it up?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Had to install newer version of tensorflow-gpu</span>
