<p>I don't precisely know how to frame this question for Google so I've come here.</p>
<p>I am currently doing a lot of python programming and am also using GitHub. However, my current situation has me moving around between different PCs quite often. I've started using WinPython to make my programming platform mobile.</p>
<p>Now I want to know if it is possible to work directly to and from a online GitHub repository without downloading or cloning the repo to my local drive?</p>
<p>I've seen some similar questions and have come across "CDN" and "jsDelivr". If CDNs are the way would someone mind explaining it to me simply?</p>
<p>Thank you all</p>

<p>You actually can edit your code directly on github. So the answare is easy, open github, then open the file you want to edit and click edit (top right). Do your changes, then click commit. </p>
<p>In my opinion this is nonsense, it will take much more time than a pull. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">CDNs definitely aren't the answer, but you might want to search for online IDEs. There are a whole bunch of them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Chris, I've tried repl.it but I am developing in a setting where the internet is not free but pay-as-you-go (per mb - barbaric I know) and this would require me to "download" all the necessary packages each and every time I use a new PC.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think cloud IDEs <i>would</i> require that (though I'm not familiar with repl.it). The whole point is that your development environment lives on the cloud. Keep looking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Miles, but what about running and testing and development?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You&amp;amp;#39;re describing an ide. I don&amp;amp;#39;t think that you&amp;amp;#39;ll find an ide that will edit directly your code on github. But pycharm professional allows you to edit cloud code (like code on a virtual machine for example). Google for it.</span>
