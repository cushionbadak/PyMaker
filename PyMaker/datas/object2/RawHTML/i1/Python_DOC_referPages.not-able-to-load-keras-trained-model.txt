<p>I have trained the model successfully but when I tried to load the model using keras load_model it gives me following error-
Unknown layer: AttentionWithContext</p>

<p>According to the link that you have shared, your model has an explicitly defined layer AttentionWithContext() added to the model. When you are trying to load the model using keras' load_model, the method shows error because this layer is not in-built in keras and to solve this you might have to define that layer again in your code before loading the model using load_model. Please try to write the class AttentionWithContext(layer) as it is in your provided link (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/news-classification-using-han/notebook" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/news-classification-using-han/notebook</a>) before trying to load the model.</p>
