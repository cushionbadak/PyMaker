<p>I'm trying to create a simple interactive plot with sliders and matplotlib in Jupyter, however, the icons are simply showing a blank square instead? Figure below:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2HBTO.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Blank icons using notebook backend</a></p>
<p>Am I missing a dependency? I believe I'm using default settings for everything. </p>
<p>A simplified version of my code is shown below:</p>
<pre><code>%matplotlib notebook
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ipywidgets import FloatSlider, interact

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,3))
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
ax.set_xlabel('time [s]')
ax.set_ylabel('displacement [cm]')
x1, = ax.plot(t,x)

def update(P_l = FloatSlider(min=0,max=4000,step=50,value=1500)):
    x1.set_ydata(x)

    fig.canvas.draw()

interact(update)
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Jupyter Notebook tends to minimize heavy graphs and tables when it exceeds a specific size. Not sure about the accurate answer, But did you try double clicking the left edge of graph? It does the job in my windows PC.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think this should only happen if jupyter notebook is not packaged correctly and does not include font-awesome for some reason. See e.g. <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3653" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for you help. I'll have a look into this - strange how it's not installed by default</span>
