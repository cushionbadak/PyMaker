<p>I am doing some Natural Language processing in which I have generated the following output:</p>
<pre><code>connect^NN - appears^VBZ cant^JJ lose^JJ make^VBP pretty^JJ pro^JJ make^JJ compared^VBN made^VBD tracked^VBD navigate^JJ click^JJ kept^VBD trail^JJ downloaded^VBD

app^NN - nt^VB go^VBP see^VB relate^JJ pervious^JJ
</code></pre>
<p>I need to write a script to get rid of all the POS tags such as ^NN, ^VBZ, ^JJ, ^VBP and hence achieve the following output: </p>
<pre><code> connect - appears cant lose make pretty pro make compared made tracked navigate click kept trail downloaded
  app - nt go see relate pervious
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming that every POS tags starts with the '^' characters and ends with the space character, you can use the following regex: </p>
<pre><code>import re
re.sub('\^.*?\s', ' ', string)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried? What didn't work? What did you get? What did you expect? What doesn't work with your code and where is it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">True. That's great. Hadn't noticed.</span>
