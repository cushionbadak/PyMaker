<p>I am a beginner in Django and need to learn it for a local bot web application.
Usually, modern MVC and MVM web frameworks such as ASP.net core and meteor have simple possibilities and tricks for membership and the user account (especially meteor). But I didn't find anything about this in Django. Does Django has these possibilities or I should download third-party packages?</p>

<p>Django has of course several methods related to user authentication or ACL and so on.
See this

<p>One exemple you can retrive user of request:</p>
<pre><code>request.user
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "membership"? Are you asking about <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/auth/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">managing user accounts, authentication, etc.</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes I mean the user account.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, cool. Start by reading the link I provided above.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You didn't look very hard, since this is well covered in the Django docs.</span>
