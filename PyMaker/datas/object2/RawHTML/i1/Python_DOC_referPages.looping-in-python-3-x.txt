<p>I'm new to coding and I would very much like anybodies help. The code posted below should only terminate when a negative value is inserted by the user. Despite my efforts, the code still evaluates the non-negative number before termination. 
For example:
If the user were to input 2, 3, and -1. The output from the sum should be 5. 
The actual output I'm getting is 4.</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>number = 0.0
numSum = 0.0
count = 0.0

while number &gt;= 0:
    number = float(input("Enter a non-negative number: "))
    numSum = numSum + number
    count = count + 1
    average = numSum / count
    print("Sum: " + str(round(numSum, 2)))
    print("Average: " + str(round(average, 2)))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Why does my code evaluate the condition that should terminate the while loop (a negative number)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because you're only checking if <code>number</code> is a negative number <em><strong>after</strong></em> the code of the while loop has already been run. You need to check if <code>number</code> is negative directly after the user inputs a number:</p>
<pre><code>number = 0.0
numSum = 0.0
count = 0.0

while True:
    number = float(input("Enter a non-negative number: "))
    if number &lt; 0:
        break
    numSum = numSum + number
    count = count + 1
    average = numSum / count
    print("Sum: " + str(round(numSum, 2)))
    print("Average: " + str(round(average, 2)))
</code></pre>
<p>This way, the code of the while is only run if <code>number</code> is not negative.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your question is not clear, but perhaps you are being confused by the fact that you input <code>number</code> at the top of your <code>while</code> block, so the whole rest of the block will be executed before the condition is checked.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When <code>while number &gt;= 0</code> is reached <code>number = 0.0</code>. The while won't run.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python 3.0 is <i>ancient</i>. Are you sure that's what you're using? You should probably be using at <i>least</i> Python 3.4 and likely 3.6 or 3.7.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If I had to guess, he probably meant something more like Python 3.x @Chris.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChristianDean, that's very likely, but we shouldn't have to guess. That's why I asked if OP is sure that's what they're using.</span>
