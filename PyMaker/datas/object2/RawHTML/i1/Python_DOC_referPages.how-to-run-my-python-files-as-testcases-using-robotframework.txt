<p>I have automated my window app using python library called pywinauto. I have a set of python files, each files will handle each functionalities. I want to create the testcases using these python modules and run it sequentially. how can i do it using Robotframework? i have the setup ready. But don't know how to proceed.</p>

<p>You choose one of your Python files to be the keywords library for Robot Framework. If it's a class, its public methods will be the keywords you use from Robot Framework test cases. See the example at the beginning of <a href="http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#creating-test-libraries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">4.1 Creating test libraries</a> in the User Guide.</p>
<p>Then you write a <code>.robot</code> file with the Robot Framework syntax to execute your test. You import your Python keywords into that with the <code>Library</code> setting or the <code>Import Library</code> keyword. </p>
<p>For example, if your Python class using pywinauto has the methods <code>click_on_button(self, button_caption)</code>, your <code>.robot</code> file could be something like:</p>
<pre><code>*** Settings ***
Library     your_python_filename

*** Test Cases***
Test Case Name
    Click on button    Button Caption here
</code></pre>
