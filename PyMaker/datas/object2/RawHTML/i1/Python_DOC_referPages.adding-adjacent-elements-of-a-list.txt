<p>I need to do the following loop in python (in pseudo-code, I'm learning python)</p>
<pre><code>listOfNumbers = [1,2,3]
averagesOfNumbers = [0,0,0]

for i = 1 to 2
   averagesOfNumbers [i] = (listOfNumbers [i] + listOfNumbers[i + 1]) / 2
end i
</code></pre>
<p>averageOfNumbers will look like [1.5, 2.5, 0].</p>
<p>How do I do this in Python?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>See the code if this is what you're looking for:</p>
<pre><code>List=[1,2,3]
avg=[0]*len(List)
for i in range(len(List)-1):
    avg[i]=(List[i]+List[i+1])/2
print(avg)
</code></pre>
<p>Hope you got the code.
Output:
[1.5,2.5,0]</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is how you would do it in Python:</p>
<pre><code>listOfNumbers = [1,2,3]
averagesOfNumbers = [0,0,0]

# In Python, we start counting from 0.
# So, 2 means 0,1 and in total, that 
# is 2 numbers.
for i in range(2):
    averagesOfNumbers [i] = (listOfNumbers [i] + listOfNumbers[i + 1])/2

print(averagesOfNumbers)

<p>I guess you want to do the following:</p>
<pre><code>listOfNumbers = [1,2,3]

<p>What is the most pythonic way here is to make use of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a>. This avoids having indexes that you don't really use: </p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = [1,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [sum(pair)/2 for pair in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])]
[1.5, 2.5]
</code></pre>
<p>If you really need to have a zero at the end, you can just add it manually: </p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>numbers = [1,2,3]
avg = [sum(pair)/2 for pair in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])]
avg.append(0)
</code></pre>
<p>In some cases (eg. you don't need a list, but an iterator) it might even be clearer to use <code>map</code>: </p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; map(lambda pair: sum(pair)/2, zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
&lt;map object ...&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Wow this is so cool. I never used stackoverflow before. I've always wondered how to get the smart people to help me !!</p>
<p>Here is what gives me the right answer to my homework.</p>
<p>calculate average change, greatest increase, greatest decrease.</p>
<p><code>i = 0</code>
<code>while (i &lt; rowCount - 1):</code>
<code>diffPL.append(PL[i+1] - PL[i])</code>
<code>i = i + 1</code>
<code>averageChange = sum(diffPL)/len(diffPL)</code>
<code>greatestIncrease = max(diffPL)</code>
<code>greatestDecrease = min(diffPL)</code></p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who offered suggestions.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">From 1 to 2 meaning just 1?</span>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>average = [(nums[i]+nums[i+1])/2 for i in range(len(nums)-1)]</code> I'll leave you to disect it and I would suggest looking up Python array manipulation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>list</code> shadows the built in class</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just edited now,thanks @Ayxan</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>"2 means 0,1,2"</i> actually <code>range(2)</code> means from 0 up to <b>but not including</b> 2. (just 0 and 1)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ayxan Thank you for your correction, I was nothing thinking properly. I fixed it in my answer :)</span>
