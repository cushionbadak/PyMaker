<p>I am trying to play around with machine learning but I am having issues with sklearn and importing cross_validation. I keep getting error messages saying </p>
<pre><code>ImportError: cannot import name 'cross_validation' from 'sklearn' (C:\Python3.7\lib\site-packages\sklearn\__init__.py)
</code></pre>
<p>When I check pip list, it is definitely there; showing sklearn 0.0. There seems to be no other version of sklearn apart from 0.0.</p>
<p>Someone please help. </p>
<p>I am using sentdex's youtube tutorial series on regression for this code. </p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

import sklearn

from sklearn import preprocessing, cross_validation,svm

from sklearn import LinearRegression
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That is because Sklearn doesn't have any cross_validation module. 
Try using:</p>
<pre><code>from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate</code> it has been moved.</span>
