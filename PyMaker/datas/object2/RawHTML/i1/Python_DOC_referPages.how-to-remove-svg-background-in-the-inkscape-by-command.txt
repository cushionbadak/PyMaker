<p>Here is the situation. I use the Inkscape command to transform png file to svg file.<br/>
Like this in cmd:
<code>inkscape image.png --export-plain-svg=image.svg</code></p>
<p>However, I need to remove the background of the svg file. 
The GUI process is (1) open up the file, (2) select all(Alt + A) and (3) selecet "Path" -&gt; Trace BitMap -&gt; click the Remove Background. Finally, save it.</p>

<p>Is there any command which can insert in the terminal or cmd even in python to do this process???</p>
<p>i might have thousands of svg files...</p>

<p>What you're doing with your command is embedding a png image into an SVG image. </p>
<p>What you want to do is to trace a png image to turn it into vector data. I don't think tracing works without GUI currently. What you want is not possible with Inkscape 0.92.4.</p>
<p>You need to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a different software or</li>
<li>write an extension that can run potrace without parameters, or with default parameters or</li>
<li>run potrace directly</li>
<li>do this manually</li>
</ul>
