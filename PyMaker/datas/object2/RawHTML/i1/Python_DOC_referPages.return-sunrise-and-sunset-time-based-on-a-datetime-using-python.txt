<p>I want to add two columns of sunrise time and sunset time based on the <strong>date</strong> on the <code>df</code> like below as an example:    </p>
<pre><code>DateTime            Pdc  Sunrise  Sunset
01/04/2016 10:00    1    time     time
01/04/2016 10:05    2    time     time
02/04/2016 10:10    3    time     time
02/04/2016 10:15    4    time     time
03/04/2016 10:20    5    time     time
03/04/2016 10:25    6    time     time
03/04/2016 10:30    7    time     time
</code></pre>
<p>I have no idea how to do that. Trying <a href="https://michelanders.blogspot.com/2010/12/calulating-sunrise-and-sunset-in-python.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a>, I don't know how to implement it without package <code>timezone</code>. <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/almanac.html#sunrise-and-sunset" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This</a> return error that I cannot solve. <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This</a> works with Python 2, I didn't check it. <a href="https://pypi.org/project/astral/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This</a> works for cities on the list, but not my cities.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can retrieve sunset and sunrise time from <a href="https://sunrise-sunset.org/api" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://sunrise-sunset.org/api</a>. 
All you need is to know your latitude and longitude. If you don't know them you can  retrieve them from <code>geopy</code> lib:</p>
<pre><code>import requests
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim

location = Nominatim().geocode('Moscow')
r = requests.get('https://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json', params={'lat': location.latitude, 'lng': location.longitude}).json()['results']
print('Sunrise:', r['sunrise'])
print('Sunset:', r['sunset'])
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Sunrise: 3:30:56 AM
Sunset: 3:42:58 PM
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>This works for cities on the list, but not my cities</code> - find city that located in the same timezone as yours.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Alderven Just timezone is too broad; e.g. China is one huge timezone, but with vastly different celestial times.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You cite a link and say that it doesn't work because there is no package named <code>timezone</code>. But the link says: "a default datetime is used that is initialized with a LocalTimezone object from the timezone module. I have not provided that module here but you can implement one simple enough by copying the example in Python's documentation" so I think it is going a little far to say it doesn't work. You haven't really tried to make it work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Alderven city of same time zone is not enough. The lattitude also matters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Setting aside the fact that this question is really just a request for code, at a minimum you would need to include some sort of location column in the DataFrame  posted in the question in order for anyone to determine sunrise or sunset on a particular date in a particular place. Much better would be to simplify your question with some sort of code attempt included. For example: how to determine sunrise time by date and location?</span>
