<p>I have code as below.i get bunch of <code>SettingWithCopyWarning</code> messages. But if i check 3 dataframes after the last statement, only <code>df_numeric['class']</code> has value 99. In other two dataframes <code>class</code> value remains unchanged. WHy? i thought that due to <code>SettingWithCopyWarning</code>, after the last statement <code>class</code> values in all dataframe would change</p>
<p>please explain what is going on </p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
data = [['Alex',10,5,0],['Bob',12,4,1],['Clarke',13,6,0],['brke',15,1,0]]
df = pd.DataFrame(data,columns=['Name','Age','weight','class'],dtype=float) 

df_numeric=df.select_dtypes(include='number')#, exclude=None)[source]
df_non_numeric=df.select_dtypes(exclude='number')

df_non_numeric['class']=df_numeric['class'].copy()

df_numeric['class']=99
</code></pre>

<p>A quick answer here. It's the most common <strong>warning</strong> in <code>pandas</code>. </p>
<p>Just like <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Understanding SettingwithCopyWarning in pandas</a> said, <code>pandas</code> informs you that your operation might not have worked as expected and that you should check the result to make sure you haven’t made a mistake.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>The reason for <code>SettingwithCopyWarning</code></h3>
<p><code>SettingwithCopyWarning</code> usually happens when you are <strong>trying to assign new values to a subset <code>df2</code> of the original data frame <code>df1</code></strong></p>
<p>But the <strong>original</strong> dataframe <code>df1</code> hasn't changed at all!</p>
