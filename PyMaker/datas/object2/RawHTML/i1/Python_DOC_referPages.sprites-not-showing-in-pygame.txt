<p>I had a friend look over the code and he said there is a problem with the <strong>init</strong> under the player class but aside from that I really do not understand where the problem within the code is. </p>
<p>The window is calling properly and I'm getting the background as black but the sprite simply will not load. </p>
<p>I'm working with <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/12/game-python-add-a-player" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> tutorial here to get the sprites to show up. I already have the movement among other parts setup the only thing that doesn't seem to be working is the code revolving around the sprites.</p>
<p>Any help here would be great.</p>

<p>You do <code>world.fill(BLACK)</code> immediately for <code>pygame.display.flip()</code>.<br/>
<a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.fill" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>world.fill(BLACK)</code></a> fills the entire window surface in black and covers everything which was drawn before. <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/display.html#pygame.display.flip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pygame.display.flip()</code></a> updates the window. This causes that the window is appears completely black.</p>
<p>Change the order of the instructions to solve the issue:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>world.fill(BLACK) 
player_list.draw(world)
# world.fill(BLACK)      &lt;---- delete
pygame.display.flip()
</code></pre>
