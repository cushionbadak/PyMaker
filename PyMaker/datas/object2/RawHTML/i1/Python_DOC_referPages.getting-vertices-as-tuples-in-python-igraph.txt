<blockquote>
<p>The individual edges can be accessed by indexing the edge sequence object. It can be used as an iterable as well, or even in a list comprehension:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code># for a graph g
g = Graph.Full(3)

# Get the edges as a list of tuples
edges = [edge.tuple for edge in g.es]
print(edges)
# [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)]
</code></pre>
