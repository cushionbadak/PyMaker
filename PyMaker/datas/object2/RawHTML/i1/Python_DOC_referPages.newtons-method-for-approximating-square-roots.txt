<p>I'm trying to program a function to compute Newton's method. Expect I keep getting an error in my code. 
This is the prompt that I was given to write a code for
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ffYpy.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ffYpy.png"/></a></p>
<p>And this is my code that I have written down</p>
<pre><code>import math

def newton(x):
   tolerance = 0.000001
   estimate = 1.0
   while True:
        estimate = (estimate + x / estimate) / 2
        difference = abs(x - estimate ** 2)
        if difference &lt;= tolerance:
            break
   return estimate

def main():
   while True:
       x = input("Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: ")
       if x == '':
           break
       x = float(x)
       print("The program's estimate is", newton(x))
       print("Python's estimate is     ", math.sqrt(x))
main()
</code></pre>
<p>And it seems to be working but I keep getting this error when I run checks on Cengage
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cxwRe.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cxwRe.png"/></a></p>
<p>I'm not really sure what it means because my code seems to be running just fine. Can anyone help explain this?</p>

<p>The issue seems to occur when the input is blank. A potential workaround, assuming you would only want positive numbers as input, would be to set a negative number (or anything else of your choice), like -1 for example, as an exit condition:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>x = input("Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: ")
if not x:
    break
x = float(x)
</code></pre>
<p>This should avoid the <code>EOFError</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Edit</h3>
<p>If you want to use a blank input (hitting the return line) to break out of the loop, you can try this alternative syntax:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>x = input("Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: ")
if not x:
    break
x = float(x)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>not x</code> checks if <code>x</code> is blank. It is also more <em>pythonic</em> than <code>x == ""</code>. Additional methods to detect a blank input are in this post as well: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26226489/how-do-you-get-python-to-detect-for-no-input">How do you get Python to detect for no input</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you replace the print statements with this format: <code>print("The program's estimate is " + str(newton(x)))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now the error read as this Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit:             Traceback (most recent call last):        File "newton.py", line 20, in &lt;module&gt;        main()     File "newton.py", line 15, in main.      x = float(input("Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: "))   ValueError: could not convert string to float:</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How did you come to the conclusion that it's due to blank input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kerwei In the test output, when a blank line is entered as input, the program encounters the EOF error. It works fine in other cases</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ABusyProgrammer I ran the script locally on the py36 environment and it seems fine</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kerwei Same here, I'm running it on the py37 environment and it works, but apparently its not running on Cengage</span>
