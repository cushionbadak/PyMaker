<p>I have a python dict that I am trying to work out the frequency of which a value is listed.</p>
<p>I cannot import any additional classes so effectively need to write it from scratch.
So I have a dict() of</p>
<pre><code>1: Dog, 2: Cat, 3: Dog, 4: Elephant
</code></pre>
<p>And I want to return something like:-</p>
<pre><code>2: Dog, 1: Cat, 1:Elephant
</code></pre>
<p>This is what I have so far but I cannot work out how to get a count to work. I keep getting</p>
<pre><code>0: Dog, 0: Cat, 0: Elephant
</code></pre>
<p>This is what I have so far, could someonle please tell me where I am going wrong?</p>
<p>It's obviously something to do with my count statement (this is just something that I found online but it clearly doesn't work.</p>
<p>I create a empty dict and then add values (animals) to it along with a corresponding key. I then need to go through all the values in all the keys to return the frequency.</p>
<p>The input is a dict() object that contains the values listed of 1: Dog, 2: Cat, 3: Dog, 4: Elephant</p>
<pre><code>def frequency(self):  

    result = set()
    for i in self.items:
        result.add((self.count(i), self.items[i]))
    return sorted(result)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>suppose your dictionary is named <code>d</code> and you want a count of the values:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter
d = {1: "dog", 2: "cat", 3: "dog", 4: "elephant"}
counts = Counter(d.values())
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can use the <code>counts</code> Counter:</p>
<pre><code>counts['dog'] # 2
counts['elephant'] # 1
counts['fish'] # 0
</code></pre>
<p>If you must use custom code and classes for this instead of the standard library, I think your error is here:</p>
<pre><code>result.add((self.count(i), self.items[i]))
</code></pre>
<p>What you may want is:</p>
<pre><code>animal_name = self.items[i] #?
result.add((self.count(animal_name), animal_name))
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise you may want to share with us what is in <code>self.items</code>...</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>d = {1:"Dog",2:"Cat", 3:"Dog", 4:"Elephant"}
count = {}
for v in d.values():
    if(not(v in count)):
        count[v] = 0
    count[v] += 1
print(count)
</code></pre>
<p>{'Dog': 2, 'Cat': 1, 'Elephant': 1}</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What are you counting from? A list of names? What's the input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are passing <code>self</code> to Frequency, so are you using a class here? What's the rest of the code look like?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The input is a list of names. I've updated the question a bit to see if that helps.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you but I can't import anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bob24 see update. If you don't share the class code it can be pretty hard to help you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's understood Reut. I shall ensure that my next post is clearer. However your code has worked a treat (although I'm not sure how). Excellent work, thank you. It's taken me about 2 hours of trying before I asked the question online. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the <code>if</code> condition can be written more simply as <code>if v not in count:</code></span>
