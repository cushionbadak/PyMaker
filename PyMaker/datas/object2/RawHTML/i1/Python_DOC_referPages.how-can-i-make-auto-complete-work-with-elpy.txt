<p>I am currently trying to install the ELPY package for Emacs, which is a Python development mode.</p>
<p>I am following the instructions on the Github page, but am having issues.</p>
<p>When I evaluate the following expressions</p>
<pre><code>(package-initialize)
(elpy-enable) 
</code></pre>
<p>I see the following in the minibuffer:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5zFL0.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5zFL0.png"/></a></p>
<p>After that, auto-complete does not work in the mode, although I do see a "Python" item in the top Emacs menu when I am in an <code>*.py</code> file. This may be some other that does that.</p>
<p>Could someone tell me how to make auto-complete work with ELPY? </p>
<p>It appears that the mode is working, except for auto-complete. I expected something like this to happen, but it does not.</p>

<p>I find elpy-config helpful. Try M-x elpy-config</p>
<p>Then install any python packages that it says are missing. Missing jedi can cause company to not work. You can install jedi from the window that elpy-config brings up.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Well, I am not seeing any auto-complete. For example, I expected something like this <a href="https://files.realpython.com/media/emacs-elpy-basic.5b8849610482.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">files.realpython.com/media/emacs-elpy-basic.5b8849610482.png</a> The commands seem to be available via <code>M-x</code> and the ones I check work. I suppose that the thing works, except for auto-complete.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edited the question to reflect what you really want to know, according to your comment. Thx.</span>
