<p>Python newbie here.I wrote this function to only return even numbers as a list but I am failing at doing this. Can you please help? This is my initial function which works fine but results are not coming out as a list:</p>
<pre><code>def myfunc (*args):
    for num in args:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            print (num)
</code></pre>
<p>When you call the function for example with the following arguments:</p>
<pre><code>myfunc(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
</code></pre>
<p>I am getting:</p>
<pre><code>2
4
6
8
10
</code></pre>
<p>but I need those to be in a list, what am I missing? This doesn't work either:</p>
<pre><code>list = []
def myfunc (*args):
    for num in args:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            print (list[num])
</code></pre>
<p>Much appreciated!</p>

<p>Your function is not returning anything. You may want to get the elements by</p>
<pre><code>def myfunc (*args):
    for num in args:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            yield num
</code></pre>
<p>Or create a temporary list:</p>
<pre><code>def myfunc (*args):
    lst = []
    for num in args:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            lst.append(num)
    return lst
</code></pre>
<p>You can check your returned value in REPL:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; type(print(num)) # print() returns None
NoneType
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Explanation: In short, <code>yield</code> returns an element per time the function is iterated - and only returns an element once. So the function is also called a "generator". There is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do">an excellent post about <code>yield</code></a>. I cannot explain better than it.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Don't use <code>list</code> as variable name, <code>list</code> is a builtin method.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You are never adding the values to the list, e.g. <code>l.append(num)</code>. Note: don't use <code>list</code> as a variable name it hides python's <code>list</code> type.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I completely forgot that "list" was a reserved keyword as well as using the  append method to add to a list...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is not gonna work: <code>print (list[num])</code> :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you are right, fixed it : - )</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Much appreciated! Worked.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">quick question, how did know that the return was supposed to line up with for and not if? Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It needs to line up with <code>for</code> since the <code>return</code> should happen only after the loop is completed. If it were lined up with <code>if</code> it would only make one pass though the loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You may want to explain how <code>yield num</code> actually works. Remember, he/she is a newbie. (sorry for being annoying :P)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note: <code>list</code> is not a reserved keyword or you wouldn't be able to hide it with a variable, it is a builtin.</span>
