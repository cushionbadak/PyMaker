<p>I prepared the data set. 
My data set info:</p>
<pre><code>200x200 px RGB images
Jpg files
Class num 4
</code></pre>
<p>How do I load and train the my data set? How do I augment, separate, etc, just like cifar100 data?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Did you try loading it to your google drive, and then mounting google drive on colab? </p>
<p>Upload your data onto your google drive.
To mount your drive on colab, run the following in your colab notebook:</p>
<pre><code>from google.colab import drive
drive.mount("/content/gdrive", force_remount=True)
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can use the data as you would use it in your local machine. the path to data would look like: <code>/content/gdrive/My\ Drive/...</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you give some more information about the dataset? How much is its size and what are the number of images?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">200x200 px images, number 2000</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes Ä± did. But I couldn't convert it to the proper shape for the cnn.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your question is unclear. I don't see any relation between reshaping the data and google colab. You can write the code that you want in a python file as you do for your own computer. For file read and write, use path from google drive. Then, upload that python code to your google drive. then mount drive on google colab. run your file using : <code>!python /content/gdrive/My\ Drive/..../code.py</code> (path to your file) from the google google colab notebook.</span>
