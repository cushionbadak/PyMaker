<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a python script abc.py. Inside a shell script file, I call it <code>./abc.py</code></p>
<p>Inside abc.py, at the top, I have <code>#!/usr/bin/python</code></p>
<p><code>test -x abc.py &amp;&amp; echo true || echo false</code> return true</p>
<p>On executing the shell script, it says <code>./abc.py: Command not found.</code></p>
<p>It works if I call it as <code>python ./abc.py</code> instead of just <code>./abc.py</code></p>
<p>The issue is only with this abc.py file that I created today. The older python scripts in the same directory with different purpose and names work without any issue.</p>
<p>I have referred the correct path of the file BTW. What could be the issue?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In <code>tcsh</code>, this happens when the interpreter is invalid:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat foo
#!/invalid

$ tcsh -c './foo'
./foo: Command not found.

$ bash -c './foo'
bash: ./foo: /invalid: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p>This could be for several reasons. Perhaps your path is wrong for your system:</p>
<pre><code>% type python
python is /usr/local/bin/python
</code></pre>
<p>in this case the script needs to start with <code>#!/usr/local/bin/python</code> instead. </p>
<p>Alternatively, the script could have Windows line endings (carriage returns):</p>
<pre><code>$ cat -v foo
#!/usr/bin/python^M
...^M
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, save it with Unix line endings instead.</p>

<p>Trying to replicate your setup as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>File: <code>asdf.py</code></p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
print("Hello World")
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>File: <code>asdf.sh</code></p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
if [ -x asdf.py ]; then ./asdf.py ; else echo "Arrrrgh. File does not exist or does not have executable permisions"; fi
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now I save the files in the same directory, e.g. the Desktop, make them executable and run the <code>shell</code> script from the terminal.</p>
<pre><code>usr@cmptr $ chmod +x asdf.{py,sh}
usr@cmptr $ ls -la asdf.{py,sh}
-rwxr-xr-x 1 usr usr 613 Mar 15 22:22 asdf.py
-rwxr-xr-x 1 usr usr  56 Mar 15 22:14 asdf.sh
usr@cmptr $ ./asdf.sh
Hello World
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, maybe I have misunderstood your setup but this should work just fine.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@thatotherguy Sorry....typo....I actually had a proper file name. Just to post it as a question here on SO...I edited it to abc.py.. Have Changed it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please avoid editing output before posting it. Instead, change your code/example so that it outputs something you can post, and then copy-paste it directly (ie. edit-&gt;run-&gt;post instead of run-&gt;edit-&gt;post). It seems like it shouldn't matter, but see <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/359146/why-should-i-post-complete-errors-why-isnt-the-message-itself-enough">this meta question</a> for all the various tiny details that can make all the difference.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This time you're checking for <code>abc.PY</code> but you're running <code>abc.py</code>. Please create a new example in a new file that you're comfortable posting in its entirety. If the problem <i>is</i> with your filename, then you're asking an impossible question because you hid the source of the problem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try changing your first line to this: #!/usr/bin/env python     .By default its 3, if not then specify like pyhton2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">type doesn't exist. I did 'which python'...It returns that exact path I have listed. Moreover the older python scripts with the same header work. Only the newer one doesn't seem to work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3219492 Do <code>cat -v yourfile</code> and see if the line ends with <code>^M</code>. If it does, resave your file with Unix line endings instead of DOS ones.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks...can you please add the comment as an answer...I will accept it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Probably because I was using Sublime text editor from Windows to create the python script on remote system</span>
