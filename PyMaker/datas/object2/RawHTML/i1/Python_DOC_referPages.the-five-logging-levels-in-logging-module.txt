<p>I read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">logging — Logging facility for Python — Python 3.7.3rc1 documentation</a> and find there are 6 kinds of log level are defined</p>
<pre><code>| Level      | Numeric value |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| `CRITICAL` | 50            |
| `ERROR`    | 40            |
| `WARNING`  | 30            |
| `INFO`     | 20            |
| `DEBUG`    | 10            |
| `NOTSET`   | 0             |

<p>Upon referring to linux <code>syslog</code> ,8 kinds are definded</p>
<p><a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syslog.2.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">syslog(2) - Linux manual page</a></p>
<pre><code>The log level
       Every printk() message has its own log level.  If the log level is
       not explicitly specified as part of the message, it defaults to
       default_message_loglevel.  The conventional meaning of the log level
       is as follows:

       Kernel constant   Level value   Meaning
       KERN_EMERG                       0        System is unusable
       KERN_ALERT                        1        Action must be taken immediately
       KERN_CRIT                           2        Critical conditions
       KERN_ERR                             3        Error conditions
       KERN_WARNING                 4        Warning conditions
       KERN_NOTICE                      5        Normal but significant condition
       KERN_INFO                           6        Informational
       KERN_DEBUG                      7        Debug-level messages

       The kernel printk() routine will print a message on the console only
       if it has a log level less than the value of console_loglevel.

<p>Additionally, SSH defined 8 kinds as well</p>
<p>SSH LogLevel </p>

<pre><code>  LogLevel
         Gives the verbosity level that is used when logging messages from
         sshd(8).  The possible values are: 
         QUIET,
         FATAL, 
         ERROR, 
         INFO,
         VERBOSE,
         DEBUG, 
         DEBUG1, 
         DEBUG2, 
         and DEBUG3.  The default is INFO.
         DEBUG and DEBUG1 are equivalent.  DEBUG2 and DEBUG3 each specify
         higher levels of debugging output.  Logging with a DEBUG level
         violates the privacy of users and is not recommended.

<p>Where does the definitions of the five kinds logging level originate?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You'll notice that the <code>logging</code> module lets you define additional levels if you need to, and that the missing ones are rather specific to the domains of the tools whose documentation you are referring to.</p>
<p>"Quiet" is identical to disabling <code>logging</code> entirely and a "fatal" error would presumably be one where your Python program has to terminate. If you want additional debugging levels in a particular application of yours, go ahead and define them - though a better approach might be to just use <code>logging.DEBUG</code> for everything, and instead selectively enable or disable debug-level <code>logging</code> for individual submodules in your system.</p>
