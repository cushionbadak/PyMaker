<p>I wrote some code for converting an image to hex in the client side, and then the hex values are send to server. On the server side, this hex will be converted to binary and the binary values are written to a file. But I am not getting the same image. The resulting image is not visible at all.</p>
<p><strong>client side:</strong></p>
<pre><code>with open('1.jpg',"rb") as f:

    contents = f.read()

    contentss = binascii.hexlify(contents)

    s.send(contentss)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>server side</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>data = c.recv(1024)

binary = binascii.unhexlify(data)

f = open('1server.jpg',"wb")

f.write(binary)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>If I am printing the "<strong>binary</strong>" using "print binary", then i am getting output as   ÿØÿà</p>
<p>what is happening here? please help.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Changing 1024(length of receiving data) with the length of sent data will resolve this issue.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">If your image is bigger than 1024 you'll need to read from the socket more than once.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It worked! When I used a large value instead of 1024, I got the same image. Thank you..</span>
