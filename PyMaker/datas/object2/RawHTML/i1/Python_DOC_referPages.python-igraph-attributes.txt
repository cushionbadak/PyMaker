<p>I am looking into converting some code from Python NetworkX to Python-IGraph. When adding nodes and edges to a graph, NetworkX very easily allows you to do:
<code>g.add_node(a[0], n=a[1])</code> where a[0] is the node label and a[1] is the value of the attribute "n". How can we add attributes to a node and similarly to an edge, when creating them with Python-IGraph? Thank you!</p>

<p>Welcome to Stack Overflow! What you're looking for is here (<a href="https://igraph.org/python/doc/igraph.Graph-class.html#add_edge" rel="nofollow noreferrer">edges</a> and <a href="https://igraph.org/python/doc/igraph.Graph-class.html#add_vertex" rel="nofollow noreferrer">vertices</a>).  Here's the overview:</p>
<p>To add an edge or vertex with an attribute:</p>
<p><code>g.add_edge(source, target, some_attribute=some_value)</code></p>
<p><code>g.add_vertex(name, some_attribute=some_value)</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is exactly what I wanted; thanks so much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What if we wanted to add multiple edges with attributes? This doesn't work: <code>g.add_edges([(0,1,n=2),(0,2,n=1),(1,3,n=3),(2,3,n=5),(5,4,n=2),(5,6,n=3),(6,4,n=1)])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah I don't think it works like that</span>
