<p>My code is above.</p>
<p>Whenever I run it the normal program doesn't do anything (I've tried replacing the last three <code>wn</code>'s with <code>turtle</code>).</p>
<p>But when I close the window another one pops up (Only when last three are turtle) and I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>     ================================
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>I'm not really sure what to do here, all that error stuff is confusing to me and I don't understand, I appreciate all the help I can get, thank you.</p>

<p>The problem is on line 34. When you call <code>turtle.mainloop()</code>, the program enters an infinite loop; none of the code on lines below it will execute, including your event listeners.</p>
<pre><code># ... unchanged code ...

player.speed(0)
player.penup()
turtle.mainloop()  # &lt;--- infinite loop! remove this line.

# code below this line is not executed
playerspeed = 15

# ... unchanged code ...
</code></pre>
<p>Remove this line and you'll see your handlers firing (add debug prints if you're not sure). Your second <code>turtle.mainloop()</code> call on the last line will correctly run the window.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Let me tell you your first mistake: on line 13 where you say <code>for x in range(4):</code>
the indent did not apply there. you have to indent when you have loops, otherwise you will get an error. </p>
<p>This is what I got when I copied your code and removed the <code>turtle.mainloop()</code>:

<p>Also, the <code>turtle.mainloop()</code> part doesn't do anything except keep it in an infinite loop. </p>
<p>If you absolutely want it there, the put it at the end. </p>
