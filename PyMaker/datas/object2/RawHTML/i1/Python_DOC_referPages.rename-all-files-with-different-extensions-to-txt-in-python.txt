<p>I am trying to rename all files in a folder based on the extension. I want all files to be in <code>.txt</code> format. Files in the folder can be of different extension but I am trying to have them all renamed to <code>.txt</code>.</p>

<pre><code>allFiles = 'Path where the files are located'
for filename in glob.iglob(os.path.join(allFiles, '*.0000')):
    os.rename(filename, filename[:-5] + '.txt')

<p>Not sure why you want it for, but this should do:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.rename(x, x.replace(filename.split(".")[1], 'txt')) for x in os.listdir(folder)

<span class="comment-copy">I am curious why you would rename <i>any</i> file extension to .txt? It won't make them text files. (Is it some kind of prank?)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What determine the file type is it's contents not its name. Windows  trust on extension and spread this idea but the file is what it contents not how is named</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should include the full stack trace about where this error actually occurs.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Rather than that <code>newlist</code> code, it's much simpler to instead use glob() method: <code>for f in Path(".").glob("*.0000"):</code>.</span>
