<p>I am doing challenges and this come up: we've started organising the files to try and make sense of them, but they're all locked with a numerical three-digit passcode. See if you can write a script to get into this example file alien-zip-2092.zip and read the text file inside which we think is named whatever the zip is (so in this case alien-zip-2092.txt). Oh, by the way, files should be extracted to the /tmp/ directory.</p>
<p><strong>Extract the file to the /tmp/ directory to get the flag. Make sure to break out of the loop when you hit the correct password, otherwise you will override the correct file with a blank one with the same name.</strong></p>
<pre><code>import zipfile as zip
filename = "file alien-zip-2092.zip"
zip.filename.extractall(psw=111)
</code></pre>
<p>this is what i did but did not work I thing there is another way.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should use the <code>zipfile</code> module like this:</p>
<pre><code>from zipfile import ZipFile
ZipFile('alien-zip-2092.zip').extractall(path='/tmp', pwd='111')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import zipfile
Z = zipfile.ZipFile("alien-zip-2092.zip")
PASS = bytes("111", 'utf-8')
Z.extractall(pwd=PASS)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>zip.filename.extractall(psw="111")</code> is already better. Password is a string, not a number</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're not likely to get any good answers with this post as it is currently written; it <i>looks like</i> the question you are asking is, "how do I beat this coding challenge?", and that in turn might be perceived as cheating. To get better help, you'll want to ask a more focused question about the problem you're having; see the site help page on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">How To Ask</a>. In particular, if you can, say something here about what isn't working (cryptic error message? file isn't readable? don't know how to detect when the extraction succeeds/fails?).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">syntax error cant take two argument line 2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see. Can you try <code>path</code> as a keyword argument instead? I've updated my answer accordingly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks worked!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">doesn't work  forget the code I wrote and focus more on the question because I think my doesn't make any sense</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What does "doesn't work" mean? It works correctly under Python 3.6. What error do you get?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">error says PASS = bytes("111", 'utf-8') TypeError: str() takes at most 1 argument (2 given)</span>
