<p>I am trying to import the <code>fancyimpute</code> package for imputation in dealing with missing values. However, the above error occurred when I try to do so. I tried running <code>pip3 install fancyimpute</code> in cmd but it keeps giving me this error: </p>
<pre><code>Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow (from fancyimpute) (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for tensorflow (from fancyimpute) 
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to upgrade pip but it seems it is already upgraded. I am not sure whether is it because the package <code>tensorflow</code> is not being installed which causes this error. However, when I tried to install tensorflow in cmd it does not work as well. Any help is much appreciated. </p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I am using Python 3.7 version and not using Anaconda.</p>

<p>Since you installed a 32-bit Python and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/33635450/5821988">Tensorflow supports only 64-bit Python</a>, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a 64-bit system, install a 64-bit version Python</li>
