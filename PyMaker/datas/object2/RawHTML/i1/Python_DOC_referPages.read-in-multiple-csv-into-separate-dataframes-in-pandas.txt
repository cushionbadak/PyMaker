<p>I have a long list of csv files that I want to read as dataframes and name them by their file name. For example, I want to read in the file status.csv and assign its dataframe the name <code>status</code>. Is there a way I can efficiently do this using Pandas?</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42934137/read-multiple-csvs-into-multiple-dataframes-in-pandas">this</a>, I still have to write the name of each csv in my loop. I want to avoid that. </p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://medium.com/@kadek/elegantly-reading-multiple-csvs-into-pandas-e1a76843b688" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a>, that allows me to read multiple csv into one dataframe instead of many. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can list all csv under a directory using <code>os.listdir(dirname)</code> and combine it with <code>os.path.basename</code> to parse the file name.</p>
<pre><code>import os

# current directory csv files
csvs = [x for x in os.listdir('.') if x.endswith('.csv')]
# stats.csv -&gt; stats
fns = [os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(x))[0] for x in csvs]

d = {}
for i in range(len(fns)):
    d[fns[i]] = pd.read_csv(csvs[i])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you could create a dictionary of <code>DataFrames</code>:</p>
<pre><code>d = {}  # dictionary that will hold them 

for file_name in list_of_csvs:  # loop over files

   # read csv into a dataframe and add it to dict with file_name as it key
   d[file_name] = pd.read_csv(file_name)

<span class="comment-copy">You can get all csv under current directory using <code>os.listdir(".")</code>, combined with <code>os.path.basename</code> to parse file name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you open to using <code>dask</code>?  You could read in all the separate dataframes and have them contained in one data structure, i.e., a dask dataframe, partitioned by their original file name.
