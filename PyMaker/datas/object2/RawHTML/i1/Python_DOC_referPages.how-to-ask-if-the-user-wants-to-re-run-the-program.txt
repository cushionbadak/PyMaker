<p>I have no idea how to ask users if they want to restart the program again and enter with a new file. I want to ask if the user wants to re-run the program or just terminate it. What's the easiest way to do that? The program is below:</p>
<pre><code>import nltk

data_folder = Path(input("type the path you would like to use: "))
file_to_open = data_folder / input("insert the file you would like to   use with its extension: ")

    words = word_tokenize(f.read().lower())
with open ('Fr-dictionary2.txt') as fr:
    dic = word_tokenize(fr.read().lower())

<span class="comment-copy">but I want to repeat the whole program, do I have to use def () for each part of the program and then call each def() defined if the user's answer is yes?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, you can make one function, maybe called something like <code>def main()</code> and call it once at the bottom of the script and at the end ask if the user wants to try again, just like in the example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does that mean that my program will be under this main def() function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Everything that you want to have <i>repeated</i>. That could be the whole program.</span>
