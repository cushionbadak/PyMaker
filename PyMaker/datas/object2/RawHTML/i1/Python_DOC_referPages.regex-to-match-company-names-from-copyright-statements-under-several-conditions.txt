<p>What I know of regex is only very basic stuff and at the moment not enough to come up with a good solution fast.</p>
<p>From what it seems to me, at least for these examples, the requirements to correctly capture the company name are the following:</p>
<pre><code>If there's a '©' or 'Copyright' in the sentence:
    After '©' or 'Copyright' - look for a year, e.g. '2019', or a year range, e.g. '1995 - 2018' or '2003-2019' (spaces are to catch as well]):
        If there's a dot somewhere after this year/year range, capture  the text until the dot. E.g. in 'Copyright © 1978-2019 Berkshire Hathaway Inc.' capture 'Berkshire Hathaway Inc'
        If there's no dot but there's the sentence 'All rights reserved', capture from the year/year range until there and also ignore any possible non-alphanumeric characters that precede it, such as spaces and commas. E.g. from '© 2019 Rediker Software, All Rights Reserved' capture 'Rediker Software'
        If there's no dot nor the sentence 'All rights reserved', capture from the year/year range until the end. E.g. from '© 2019 Verizon' Capture 'Verizon'
</code></pre>
<p>Any advice on a good regex for this? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You may consider a regex like</p>
<pre><code>(?i)(?:©(?:\s*Copyright)?|Copyright(?:\s*©)?)\s*\d+(?:\s*-\s*\d+)?\s*(.*?(?=\W*All\s+rights\s+reserved)|[^.]*(?=\.)|.*)
</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="https://regex101.com/r/maBHY5/7" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regex demo</a>. Use a case insensitive modifier, <code>re.I</code> with it.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>(?:©(?:\s*Copyright)?|Copyright(?:\s*©)?)</code> - either

<ul>
<li><code>©(?:\s*Copyright)?</code> -  <code>©</code> char followed with an optional substring of  0+ whitespaces  and then <code>Copyright</code> </li>
<li><code>|</code> - or</li>
<li><code>Copyright(?:\s*©)?</code> - <code>Copyright</code> followed with an optional substring of 0+ whitespaces and <code>©</code> char</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>\s*</code> - 0+ whitespaces</li>
<li><code>\d+</code> - 1+ digits (use <code>\d{4}</code> if the years always contain 4 digits)</li>
<li><code>(?:\s*-\s*\d+)?</code> - an optional sequence of a <code>-</code> enclosed with 0+ whitespaces and then 1+ digits (use <code>\d{4}</code> if the years always contain 4 digits)</li>
<li><code>\s*</code> - 0+ whitespaces</li>
<li><code>(.*?(?=\W*All\s+rights\s+reserved)|[^.]*(?=\.)|.*)</code> - <strong>Capturing group 1</strong>: any of the alternatives:

<ul>
<li><code>.*?(?=\W*All\s+rights\s+reserved)</code> - any 0+ chars other than line break chars, s few as possible, up to the 0+ non-word chars followed with <code>All rights reserved</code> string</li>
<li><code>[^.]*(?=\.)</code> - any 0+ chars other than <code>.</code> as many as possible up to <code>.</code> not including <code>.</code></li>
<li><code>.*</code> - the rest of the line</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">@TimBiegeleisen: OP asking for it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot! Maybe I wasn't clear enough in my question but I only want to keep the company name from the sentence, and remove everything else. For example in "Copyright © 2019 Apple Inc" I only want to keep "Apple Inc" and in "© 2019 Quid, Inc" I only want to keep "Quid, Inc". How would I change it to achieve that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FilipeAleixo Wrap what you need with capturing parentheses, see my updated answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FilipeAleixo I think something can be still improved. Let me think</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah yeah. In Rediker Software it's still getting ", All rights reserved"</span>
