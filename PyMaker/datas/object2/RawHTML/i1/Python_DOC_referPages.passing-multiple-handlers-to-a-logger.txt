<p>I have a logging .yaml config file (parital):</p>
<pre><code>handlers:
  console:
    class: logging.StreamHandler
    stream: ext://sys.stderr
    formatter: basic
  console_file: 
    class: logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler
    filename: bvbot_general.log
    maxBytes: 20000000
    backupCount: 3
    encoding: utf-8
    formatter: basic

loggers:
  general:
    handlers: [console]
    level: DEBUG
    propagate: False
  general_file:
    handlers: [console_file]
    level: DEBUG
    propagate: True

root:
  handlers: [console]
  level: INFO
</code></pre>
<p>Individually the loggers 'general' and 'general_file' work as expected. But, if I add the 'console_file' handler to logger 'general', I only get output to console and not also to file as anticipated:</p>
<pre><code>loggers:
  general:
    handlers: [console, console_file]
    level: DEBUG
    propagate: False
</code></pre>

<p>How do get your logger? Works fine for me with following code:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import logging.config

import yaml

# Loading from logging.yaml
# ...

logger = logging.getLogger('general')
logger.info('hello')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I  was modifying the .yaml in my package as opposed to the one located in my home folder, which takes presidence :( I'll prob remove this question..</span>
