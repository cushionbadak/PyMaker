<p>I have two Python files, file 1 and file 2 that does two separate things. I want to run them together. I am using VS2017</p>
<p>The pseudo code for file 1 is:</p>
<pre><code>Class A:
   foo1():
    .
    .
   foo2();
    if variable&lt;30;
        #do this
    else;
      process = subprocess.Popen('py file2.py' ,shell=True,stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None, close_fds=True)

    #rest of the code for foo2()

if __name__ == "__main__":   
  A.foo2();
</code></pre>
<p>I also wanted to pass a variable to the second file. I am looking into something like </p>
<pre><code>variable = input("enter variable)
cmd = ['py file2.py', variable]
subprocess.Popen(cmd ,shell=True,stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None, close_fds=True)
</code></pre>
<p>I am getting an error saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'"py subproleap.py"' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  operable program or batch file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Even if I do pass the variable how do I get the file2.py to read it? </p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. I am a beginner in python.    </p>
<p>EDIT1:
Why I use subprocess is that I want the file2.py to run in the background,once the condition is met, while the main process runs in the side. </p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4789837/how-to-terminate-a-python-subprocess-launched-with-shell-true">This</a> may answer your question (you are using the <code>shell=True</code> param)</p>
<p>But wouldn't it be easier to import <code>file2</code> as a module in <code>file1</code>? (if you're not already familiar with importing, you can refer to <a href="https://chrisyeh96.github.io/2017/08/08/definitive-guide-python-imports.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this guide</a>)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you please elaborate?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Linking to another question is not a good answer; unfortunately, that cancels out the +1 I would give for the <code>import</code> suggestion.</span>
