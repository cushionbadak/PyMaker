<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>Don't</strong> save your mp3 files where your <code>template</code> folder exists. save user uploaded content to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/#std:setting-MEDIA_ROOT" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MEDIA_ROOT</a> and save static contents (like css, js and not user content images) in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/#static-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">STATIC_ROOT</a>.   </p>
<p><strong>Don't serve static and media files with django codes</strong>. it is bad practice to server static content with django (you have to use something like Nginx for handle static files =&gt; see <a href="https://gist.github.com/asmallteapot/2038673" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> and <a href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/Django_and_nginx.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> for instance). </p>
<p>if you are insisting to use django for serving static files, In end of your <code>views.py</code> related function add these code and return the mp3 file like this:</p>
<pre><code>def your_view_function(request):
    # your other codes ...
    file = open("/path/to/your/song.mp3", "rb").read() 
    response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=filename.mp3' 
    return HttpResponse(file, mimetype="audio/mpeg") 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why would you save an audio file in a templates directory?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what should I do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The first paragraph was good. The second is wrong. You should not be invoking Django code to serve static files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanielRoseman I know this is bad practice. I update my answer is that better now ? thanks for your help.</span>
