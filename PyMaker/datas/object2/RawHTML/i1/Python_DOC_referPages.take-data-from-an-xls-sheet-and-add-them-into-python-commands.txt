<p>I've been asked to create a Python script to automate a server deployment for 80 retail stores.</p>
<p>As part of this script, I have a secondary script that I call to change multiple values in 9 XML files, however, the values are unique for each store, so this script needs to be changed each time, but after I am gone, this is going to be done by semi /  non-technical people, so we don't want them to change the Python scripts directly for fear of breaking them.</p>
<p>This in mind, I would like to have these people input the store details into an XLS sheet, and a python file read this sheet and put the data it finds into the existing python script with the data to be changed.
The file will be 2 columns, with the required data in the 2nd one.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this is a long explanation, but that is the gist of it. I'm using python 2.6. Does anyone have a clue about how I can do this? Or which language might be better for this. I also know Bash and Javascript.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
