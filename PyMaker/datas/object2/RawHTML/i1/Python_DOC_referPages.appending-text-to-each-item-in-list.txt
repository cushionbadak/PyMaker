<p>I would like to add the word days to appear after each item in my list (each item is a numpy.int64) such that each item appears followed by the word days (e.g 6 days).</p>
<p>This is what I have tried so far</p>
<pre><code>medians =  closing_deals.groupby(['origin'])['days_to_close'].median().values
median_labels = [m + 'days' for m in medians]
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my data</p>
<pre><code>array([ 9, 11,  7, 27, 13, 42, 35, 10,  9, 23, 17])

<p>This is the error message I am receiving</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can't concatenate int with string using <code>+</code>, but you can use string formatting to get the output you are looking for. For example:</p>
<pre><code>medians = [9, 11, 7, 27, 13, 42, 35, 10, 9, 23, 17]
labels = [f'{m} days' for m in medians]
print(labels)
# ['9 days', '11 days', '7 days', '27 days', '13 days', '42 days', '35 days', '10 days', '9 days', '23 days', '17 days']

# For Python 3 versions before 3.6, use '{} days'.format(m) instead of the f string
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@Austin Sorry forgot to add, this is my error message "TypeError: ufunc 'add' did not contain a loop with signature matching types dtype('&lt;U21') dtype('&lt;U21') dtype('&lt;U21')"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're trying to add an integer and a string.  The error message says that you haven't defined any such vectorized function.  Try <code>str(m) + 'days'</code>.
