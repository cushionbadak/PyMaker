<p>I came across a function named <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.any.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">any</a> with <code>numpy</code> and I could not understand its usage in some context which is given as folllows:</p>
<pre><code>if np.subtract(original.shape, duplicate.shape).any():
   # Do something
else:
   # Carry on with the usual tasks
</code></pre>
<p>Could someone help me understand what is happening here? What is being checked? The documentation says, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tests whether any array element along a given axis evaluates to True.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it being checked for equality? To understand this better, how could I rewrite the <code>any</code> call?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>np.any(x)</code> checks if any of the elements in <code>x</code> is true. In your case, it checks if the arrays <code>original</code> and <code>duplicate</code> have at least a different dimension.</p>
<p>You could rewrite this as:</p>
<pre><code>res = False
for so, sd in zip(original.shape, duplicate.shape):
    if so != sd:
        res = True

if res:
    # Do something
else:
   # Carry on with the usual tasks
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's being checked for "True"ness.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy

print(numpy.any([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
print(numpy.any([0, 0, 0, 0, 1]))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>any</code> method checks if at least on element in the given data is evaluated as <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>In python the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">following things are evaluated <code>False</code></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>None</code></li>
<li><code>False</code></li>
<li>any numeric zero</li>
<li>empty strings, sets, lists, dictionaries ...</li>
<li>anything that has a <code>__len__</code> method which returns 0 or a <code>__bool__</code> method that returns <code>False</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else is evaluated <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>If the data checked by the <code>any</code> method contains at least one item that does not meet these requirements, it returns <code>True</code> else <code>False</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">iterate over the array, check if any element is <code>True</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Shilo in the context of numpy ndarray objects, that isn't true, and the <code>&lt;=0</code> is not true in python generally.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga oh, you're totally right.. Only 0 is going to evaluate to False when checking an int. Updating comment.  If something evaluates to True that means that value is not None,False or == 0. the <code>any</code> function checks items in the array for the above</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is this the same as <code>if original.shape != duplicate.shape:</code>?  I can't think of a combination of shapes where the test would be different.</span>
