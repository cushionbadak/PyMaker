<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm creating a web applcation in Python and I only want the user to be able to enter a weekday that is older than today's date. I've had a look at isoweekday() for example but don't know how to integrate it into a flask form. The form currently looks like this:</p>
<p><code>appointment_date = DateField('Appointment Date', format='%Y-%m-%d', validators=[DataRequired()])</code></p>
<p>Thanks</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you just want a weekday, you should put a <code>select</code> or a <code>textbox</code>, not a <code>date picker</code>.</p>
<p>If you put a <code>select</code>, you can disable the days before today so you don't even need a validation</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the answer, what would I need to change in the code to do this? Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use something like this: <code>SelectField(u'Field name', choices = myChoices, validators = [Required()])</code>. Take a look at <a href="https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/stable/fields.html#wtforms.fields.SelectField" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">but how would I set this so that the number of days in the month is correct? Eg not having 31 in every month?</span>
