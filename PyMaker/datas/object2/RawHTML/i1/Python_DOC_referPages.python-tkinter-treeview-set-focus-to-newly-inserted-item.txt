<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am inserting a new item with eg:</p>
<pre><code># Insert new item as child of current item
tree.insert(current_node_iid, 1, text="New note")
</code></pre>
<p>And I can set focus on an item with:</p>
<pre><code># Must select and then focus using the iid of an item
tree.selection_set("I001")
tree.focus("I001")
</code></pre>
<p>BUT if I insert a new item, and I let Python set the index of the new item, then I do not know this new index, and so I cannot set focus on the new item.</p>
<p>I could of course specify the iid of the new item, but then I would have to check if the iid has already been used by another item, which I dont know how to do.</p>
<p>How do I set focus on a new item?</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks ahead of time.</p>

<p>Just define a variable for your <code>tree.insert</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>a = tree.insert(current_node_iid, 1, text="New note")
print (a)
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code>I001
</code></pre>
