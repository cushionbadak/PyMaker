<p>I'm trying to read a file into a list using Python. But when I do that the list appears with blank lines after each entry. The source file doesn't have that!</p>
<p>My code:</p>
<pre><code>aws_env_list="../../../source_files/aws_environments/aws_environments_all.txt"
    with open(aws_env_list, 'r') as aws_envs:
        for line in aws_envs:
        print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>Each line prints out with a blank line after each entry:</p>
<pre><code>company-lab

company-bill

company-stage

company-dlab

company-nonprod

company-prod

company-eng-cis
</code></pre>
<p>The source file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>company-lab
company-bill
company-stage
company-dlab
company-nonprod
company-prod
company-eng-cis
</code></pre>
<p>How do I get rid of the blank line after each entry?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your file has a new line character at the end of each line like:</p>
<pre><code>company-lab\n
company-bill\n
company-stage\n
company-dlab\n
company-nonprod\n
company-prod\n
company-eng-cis # not here though this has an EOF (end-of-file) character.
</code></pre>
<p>So your call to <code>print(line)</code> is including these in the print! You can avoid this like:</p>
<pre><code>aws_env_list="../../../source_files/aws_environments/aws_environments_all.txt"
with open(aws_env_list, 'r') as aws_envs:
    for line in aws_envs.readlines():
        print(line.strip()) # just strip the \n away!
</code></pre>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to compute with just the text and not the newline character you can strip it away like this:</p>
<pre><code>aws_env_list="../../../source_files/aws_environments/aws_environments_all.txt"
with open(aws_env_list, 'r') as aws_envs:
    for line in aws_envs.readlines(): 
        line = line.strip() # You can strip it here and reassign it to the same variable
        # Now all your previous code with the variable 'line' will work as expected
        print(line) # no need to strip again
        do_computations(line) # you can pass it to functions without worry
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you iterate over a file line-by-line using:</p>
<pre><code>for line in aws_envs:
</code></pre>
<p>The value of <code>line</code> includes the end-of-line character...and the <code>print</code> command, by default, <em>adds</em> an end-of-line character to your output.  You can suppress that by setting the <code>end</code> parameter to an empty value.  Compare:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print('one');print('two')
one
two
</code></pre>
<p>Vs:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print('one', end='');print('two')
onetwo
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The file contains newlines (<code>'\n'</code>) but doesn't remove them when you loop over it. The print function also prints a newline at the end. So you either use <code>print(line, end='')</code> to remove the new line from the print function or use <code>line=line.strip()</code> to remove the newline from the line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! That worked perfectly. However my real goal is to iterate over the list of AWS environments list. And run ec2 commands using boto. Will the newline at the end of each line cause a problem with that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bluethundr I updated my post! Let me know if I was unclear</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah that looks great! I will give it a try. Thank you.</span>
