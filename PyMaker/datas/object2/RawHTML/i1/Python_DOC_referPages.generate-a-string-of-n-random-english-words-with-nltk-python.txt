<p>Is there a way to generate a string of N random English words using NLTK/Python? </p>
<p>I am aware of NLTK's ability to generate sentences based on input text and a grammar, but I don't need to generate sentences based on any sort of grammar - I just need to randomly select N words from a given dictionary/vocabulary, and concatenate them into a string. I am also aware of ability to generate random strings of characters or how to use NLTK to generate "English-looking" nonsense words using n-grams, but I need the words to be actual English words from some dictionary file.</p>
<p>I tried doing this:</p>
<pre><code>from nltk.corpus import words
from random import sample

n = 100
rand_words = ' '.join(sample(words, n))
</code></pre>
<p>But <code>words</code> is not an iterable so I can't use it this way. What is the correct way to create a random string of English words using NLTK's builtin dictionaries?</p>

<p>you just need to use the <code>words()</code> function <a href="http://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html#fig-text-corpus-structure" rel="nofollow noreferrer">corpus-structure</a></p>
<pre><code>rand_words = ' '.join(sample(words<b>.words()</b>, n))
</code></pre>
