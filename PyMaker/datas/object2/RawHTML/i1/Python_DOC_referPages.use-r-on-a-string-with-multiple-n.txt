<p>I have a String with multiple \n in it to get it in a square form f.ex. for a matrix, a map etc. </p>
<p>If I want to override this with </p>
<p><code>sys.stdout.write("\r %s" % TheString)
 sys.stdout.flush()</code></p>
<p>it jumps to the beginning of the last row, overrides it and prints the new string underneath.
But I want it to jump all the way up to the first row and override the entire output.
I tried it with multiple \r (times number of rows) but it didn't work. Is there an other possibility?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>IIUC it's not easily possible as pointed by @Boldewyn  but you may clear the screen from the previous outputs before issuing a new <code>sys.stdout.write</code> using <code>os.system("clear")</code> (in UNIX-like systems):</p>
<pre><code>import os
import sys

sys.stdout.write("This")
sys.stdout.write("Will")
sys.stdout.write("Not")
sys.stdout.write("Show")

# After this command all output before will be cleared
os.system("clear")
sys.stdout.write("\r %s" % "Blablablabla")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Only if you go the extra mile and take over the whole screen, e.g., with <a href="http://php.net/manual/book.ncurses.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ncurses</code></a>. Otherwise youâ€™re always confined to the last line, i.e., the line that is currently getting printed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What would you consider "the first row" exactly? First line of output of your script?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SzymonMaszke yes if I output   ***** \n ***** \n ***** \n ***** \n  I would like to jump to the first row of * and override all rows</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you ! That works</span>
