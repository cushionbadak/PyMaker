<p>I am learning python,and I am confused about how the index of an array woks in python.
 Following is my code</p>
<pre><code>test_var = "hello how are you"

print(test_var[-1], ",", test_var.find('t'))
</code></pre>
<p>The output of this program is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>u , -1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I understand that negative indexing is allowed in python unlike java and it most probably works in cyclic manner so that <code>-1</code> indicates the last character.</p>
<p>But when it comes to <code>find</code> method and it does not match any character <code>'t'</code> it again gives <code>-1</code>. So does it imply that <code>-1</code> is like the null value in python?
And it does <em>not</em> mean that <code>find</code> has returned the position of the last character?</p>
<p><strong>Is it just me or would it be less confusing if an unsuccessful <code>find</code> would return <code>None</code>?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For this example, if you index some element for an iterable (list, tuple, set or string) with negative integers, the elements start from the right to left with -1, something like this:</p>
<pre><code>  0    1    2    3  
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
  -4  -3   -2   -1
</code></pre>
<p>For the <code>find</code> function, this return -1 when it doesn't find an element, else return the index</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>-1</code> returned from <code>find</code> versus the <code>-1</code> used in indexing have completely different meanings (or semantics, you might say). The former means "item x wasn't found", the latter means "the last item in the list". These definitions are supposedly well-defined in Python documentation. If an item was found in a list, <code>find</code> will return a positive integer. Guaranteed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In your example -1 -&gt; d , so if find returns -1 should i not mean it is returning position of d ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was referring to the <code>find</code> of your example, if I write <code>list.find('d')</code> in the list of my example, it return 3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes exactly so [-1] is u but while returning index it is 3</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>find</code> function return positive index, work with it...if it return -1, is because it didn't find an element</span>
