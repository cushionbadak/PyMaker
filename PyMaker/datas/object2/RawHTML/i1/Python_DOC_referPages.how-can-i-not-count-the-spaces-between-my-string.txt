<p>So I have, p.e, this string: ' I love python  ' and I want to convert all the spaces to '_'. My problem is that I also need to delete the outside spaces so I dont finish with the result: '_I_love_python__' and more like this 'I_love_python'
I searched and found out that I can develop it with a single line of code <code>mystring.strip().replace(" ", "_")</code> which is unfortunaly is sintax that I cant apply in my essay.
So what I landed with was this:</p>
<pre><code>frase= str(input('Introduza: '))

aux=''


for car in frase:
    if car==' ':
        car='_'
        aux+=car
    else:
        aux+=car



print(aux)
</code></pre>
<p>My problem now is on deleting those outside spaces. What I thought about was runing another for i in in the start and another on the final of the string and to stop until they found a non space caracter. But unfortunaly I havent been able to do that...</p>
<p>Apreciate all the help you can suply!</p>

<p>I came up with following solution:</p>
<p>You iterate over the string, but instead of replacing the space with underscore as soon as it appears, you store the amount of spaces encountered. Then, once a non-space-character is reached, you add the amount of spaces found to the string. So if the string ends with lots of spaces, it will never reach a non-space-character and therefore never add the underscores. </p>
<p>For cutting off the spaces at the beginning, I just added a condition to add the underscores being: "Have I encountered a non-space-character before?"</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>text = "   I love   python    e  "

out = ""

string_started = False
underscores_to_add = 0
for c in text:
    if c == " ":
        underscores_to_add += 1
    else:
        if string_started:
            out += "_" * underscores_to_add
        underscores_to_add = 0
        string_started = True
        out += c

print(out)  # prints "I_love___python____e"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the following trick to remove leading and trailing spaces in your string:</p>
<pre><code>s = ' I love python   '

ind1 = min(len(s) if c == ' ' else n for n, c in enumerate(s))
ind2 = max(0 if c == ' ' else n for n, c in enumerate(s))

s = ''.join('_' if c == ' ' else c for c in s[ind1:ind2 + 1])

print('*', s, '*', sep='')
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>*I_love_python*
</code></pre>

<h3>If you are not allowed to use strip() method</h3>
<pre><code>def find(text):
    for i, s in enumerate(text):
        if s !=  " ":
            break
    return i

text = "   I love   python    e  "
text[find(text):len(text)-find(text[::-1])].replace(" ","_")

texts = ["   I love   python    e  ","I love   python    e"," I love   python    e","I love   python    e ", "I love   python    e"]
for text in texts:
    print (text[find(text):len(text)-find(text[::-1])].replace(" ","_"))
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<p><code>
I_love___python____e

I_love___python____e
I_love___python____e

<ul>
<li>Given a string <code>find</code> will find the first non space character in the string</li>
<li>Use <code>find</code> to find the first nonspace character and the last nonspace character</li>
<li>Get the substring using above found indices</li>
<li>Replace all spaces with _ in the above substring</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>aux = frase.strip().replace(" ", "_")</code> You have to strip the outside spaces <i>first</i>, then replace what are left with <code>_</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@chepner, OP says he can't use that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The reason given for not using that makes no sense.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you allowed to use regex?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can we get more details about what you're allowed to use? Can you do <code>frase = frase.strip()</code> to get rid of the outside spaces?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much! From all the submitions yours contains vocabulary which I know and use. Once again thank you for spending some time with my problem! Cheers m8!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Curious to know why it is down voted and what my mistake is :) It will  help me in my future answers :)</span>
