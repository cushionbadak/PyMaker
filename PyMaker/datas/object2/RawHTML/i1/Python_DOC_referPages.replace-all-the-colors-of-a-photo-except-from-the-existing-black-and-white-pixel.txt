<p>I'm a beginner in python and i would like the way to change all of the pixels of a photo to white, except the pixels that white or black that were already in the photo. I tried to use PIL but I couldn't find it.
Thanks!</p>

<p>So basically you want to change all pixels to white except black, right? If so, then below work (note: it expect <code>cv2</code>lib is installed on your machine)</p>
<pre><code>import cv2
import numpy as np

img = cv2.imread('my_img.jpeg')
img[img != 0] = 255 # change everything to white where pixel is not black
cv2.imwrite('my_img2.jpeg', img)
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming you have access to matplotlib and are willing to use it:</p>
<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg

# read the image pixels and saves them as a numpy array
image = mpimg.imread('&lt;your image&gt;')

# see original image (just for testing)
plt.imshow(image)
plt.show()

# loop through all pixels, and replace those that are not strict white or black with white
for x in range(image.shape[0]):
    for y in range(image.shape[1]):
        if (image[x,y]!=0).all() and (image[x,y]!=1).all():
            image[x,y] = [1,1,1]  

# see modified image (to make sure this is what you need)
plt.imshow(image)
plt.show()

# save image
mpimg.imsave('&lt;new name&gt;',image)
</code></pre>
<p>You can probably vectorize this, but I find this more readable, depends on your preformance requirements.
Also, make sure the input is in [0,1] format. If it is in [0,255] modify the above <code>1</code>s with <code>255</code>s.</p>
<p>Edit: this solution works for RGB, with no alpha. If you have an alpha, you might need to modify, depending on your requirements.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you use matplotlib?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, this its partly what I wanted to do. I wanted to change all the pixels that were neither black or white. So, if the pixel color is different to black or white, change the color. I tried your code with     img[img != 0 and != 255] = 177 but it shows an error with the and. I was also wondeering if I could instead of changing them to a fix color (such as 177 in this example), if I could turn them transparent. Thank you so much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In that case you can go with bitwise <code>&amp;</code>, like <code>img[(img != 0) &amp; (img != 255)] = 177</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's what i wanted. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It worked perfectly yesterday but today it displays this error. What can I do?    TypeError: 'NoneType' object does not support item assignment</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Make sure <code>img</code> path that you are reading exist.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much for your help! :)</span>
