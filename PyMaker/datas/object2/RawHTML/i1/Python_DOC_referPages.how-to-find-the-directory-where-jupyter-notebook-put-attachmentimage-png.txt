<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7M2F3.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7M2F3.png"/></a></p>
<p>how to find the directory where the file 'image.png' was stored?</p>
<p>I am using Python3 kernel.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>the 'image.png' is NOT a real file, so it won't be stored outside the notebook file separately.
when you paste the screenshot, jupyter embed this png inside the notebook.</p>

<p>By default, jupyter notebooks store created files in the base directory where the process was started. When you examine the notebook server in your browser, this is where the server's file system is based.</p>
<p>Alternately, you could do something like</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import os
os.getcwd()
</code></pre>
<p>to see where it thinks its current working directory is. (I'm assuming you are using a python kernel. If you're using a different kernel, then you could do the equivalent command).</p>
