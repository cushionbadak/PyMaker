<p>I have some code using something called railway cipher (if you don't know what it is google it). Whenever I enter: Encrypt (2, "This is a test.") I want it to enter: hsi  etTi sats.</p>
<p>However, my code makes it print it in reverse: Ti sats.hsi  et.</p>
<p>Do you know how I can fix it.</p>
<p><strong><em>My code:</em></strong></p>
<pre><code>def Encrypt(numRails, plainText):
    cipherText = ""
    railDict = {}
    rail = 0

    for rail in range(numRails):
        railDict["rail"+str(rail)] = ""
        rail += 1

    for i in range(len(plainText)):
        mod = i%numRails
        railDict["rail" + str(mod)] += plainText[i]

    for i in range(numRails):
        cipherText += railDict["rail" + str(i)]

    print (cipherText)

<p>You're supposed to go back and forth over the rails when assigning, but you're just going in one direction and then going back to the beginning by using <code>i % numRails</code>.</p>
<p>There's no need to use a dictionary for the rails. Just use a list indexed by the rail number.</p>
<pre><code>def Encrypt(numRails, plainText):
    rails = [""] * numRails
    rail = 0
    direction = 1

    for c in plainText:
        rails[rail] += c
        rail += direction
        # check if we need to change directions
        if direction == 1 and rail &gt;= numRails:
            direction = -1
            rail = numRails - 2
        elif direction == -1 and rail &lt; 0:
            direction = 1
            rail = 1

    cipherText = "".join(rails)

    print (cipherText)

<span class="comment-copy">Is this a working code? numRails is used even before assigned any value. Hence my question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">telling us to go google it isnt going to help you get your question answered ... see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">According to Wikipedia, you're supposed to go back and forth through the rails. If you just use <code>i % numRails</code>, you're just going in one direction.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why use a dictionary instead of a list indexed by <code>rail</code>?</span>
