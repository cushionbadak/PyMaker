<p>I have a very large dataset : <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption</a></p>
<p>It contains around 2.5M rows.
The Pandas dataframe index is a timestamp and then it has several columns.</p>
<p>I want to filter the dataset so I only see, for instance, 9AM (09:00:00) rows only for all years (around 1400 rows aprox -&gt;365*4)</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cATWI.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Pandas dataframe looks like this</a></p>
<p>I have tried this:</p>
<p><code>dataset.groupby(dataset.index.hour == '09:00:00')</code></p>
<p>But it doesn't work. I have also tried without sucess this:</p>
<p><code>dataset['09:00:00']</code></p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Your two attempts are close! It should be possible to select desired rows using a boolean mask as follows:</p>
<pre><code>dataset[dataset.index.hour == 9]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi @marc, when you say ("But it doesn't work") what exactly do you get back? An empty dataframe? Some of the results you want, but not all of them? More results than you expected? A Mix?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi LeoRochael, I was getting an error message. Peter has solved the problem. The mistake was using <code>==09:00:00</code> instead of using <code>== 9</code>. Thanks for your help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Peter, this works now.  Thank you so much</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Marc great to hear - you're welcome!</span>
