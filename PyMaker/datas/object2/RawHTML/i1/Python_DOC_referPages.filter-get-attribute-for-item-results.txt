<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Currently I'm using get_attribute to get all the instances of data-id on the page as soon as they load. But what I'm trying to figure out is how I could filter out some of these results. Particularly the ones with certain values for their data-type attribute. Is there anyway I could do this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ids = [item.get_attribute('data-id') for item in WebDriverWait(driver,30).until(EC.presence_of_all_elements_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, "[data-id]")))]</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could add a if condition to your list comprehension :</p>
<pre><code>if item.get_attribute('data-type') == "yourValue"
</code></pre>
<p>It would then look like this:</p>
<pre><code>els = WebDriverWait(driver,30).until(EC.presence_of_all_elements_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, "[data-id]")))
ids = [item.get_attribute('data-id') 
       for item in els if item.get_attribute('data-type') == "yourValue"]
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT:<br/>
The value of item.get_attribute('data-type') is not "Knife" but "Knife ". (space at the end)</p>
<p>Solution1: Remove the whitespaces using strip():</p>
<pre><code>if item.get_attribute('data-type').strip() == "Knife"
</code></pre>
<p>Solution2: use in</p>
<pre><code> if "Knife" in item.get_attribute('data-type')
</code></pre>
<p>Solution3: add a space!</p>
<pre><code>if item.get_attribute('data-type') == "Knife "
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT2:
If you want to match multiple values use:</p>
<pre><code>accepted_type = ("Knife", "Knife2",...)
if item.get_attribute('data-type').strip() in accepted_type
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hmm seemed like it would work but for some reason when I go to print the results I'm getting [].</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That would mean your condition is never met, can you share the html code you are trying to achieve this on?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Posted my script. Maybe that will give you better context.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Next time, don't post your script as an answer but edit your question! I have edited my answer with my finding</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh my. I guess I should have pulled my Element inspect over more cause it went onto a new line and I didn't see the space. Smh. Thank you. Could I add multiple values to that like a list?</span>
