<p>I have to execute a python script which is costantly in while loop, this is script2 </p>
<pre><code>while True:
#do something
 time.sleep(30)
</code></pre>
<p>Now I have script1 which does all the calculations and then I need to execute the script2. I have tried execfile but it didn't work and I had a lot of issues.
I don't know how to use subprocess module either.
Can someone help me ?</p>

<p>Python's <code>import</code> statement runs the code which it imports to create all the functions and classes that are defined within.
Python also allows you to do this with your own files.
try this:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    from file_to_execute import *
    time.sleep(30)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>With <code>subprocess</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
while True:
    subprocess.call(["python", "/path/to/script2.py"])
    time.sleep(30)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why does it matter if the script is constantly in a loop? Executing a script always works the same way, no matter what that script does. Am I missing something?</span>
