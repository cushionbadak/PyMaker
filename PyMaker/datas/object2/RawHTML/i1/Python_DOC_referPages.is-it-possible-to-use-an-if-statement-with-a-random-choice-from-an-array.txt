<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I dont know if this is possible and any help would be appreciated. I want to use an if statement but i want it to be random i find this hard to explain so here is what i mean. The line draws every time, when i want it to be random. So if cat is randomly chose it would create that line. Any way to fix this if possible?</p>
<p>code:</p>
<pre><code>easy = ["cat","bed","sofa","cow","sheep"]
random.choice(easy)
if random.choice(easy) == "cat":
   canvas.create_line(200, 150, 200, 250,fill="white")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>welcome to Stackoverlfow. @Arn-Fey is right, a code sample should be correct and run as you post it here. As this seems to be your first post, I'll give a try to see if I understood your question nevertheless:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import random

easy = ["cat","bed","sofa","cow","sheep"]
if random.choice(easy) == "cat":
    print('create_line')
    # canvas.create_line(200, 150, 200, 250,fill="white")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The only thing wrong with this code is the indentation, so we can't help you. We need a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's nothing stopping you. You need to fix the indentation under your <code>if</code> check, and you can drop the line of just <code>random.choice(easy)</code> because it doesn't do anything useful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is this really your code? it shouldn't run with that indentation.</span>
