<p>I imported this library to my django project: <a href="https://github.com/percipient/django-allauth-2fa/blob/master/allauth_2fa/views.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/percipient/django-allauth-2fa/blob/master/allauth_2fa/views.py</a>.</p>
<p>I keep getting this error:</p>
<pre><code>TemplateDoesNotExist at /setup/
base.html
In template C:\Users\Davide\lib\site-packages\allauth_2fa\templates\allauth_2fa\setup.html, error at line 1

1   {% extends 'base.html' %}
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know why it's showing that error, because i created my own <strong>setup.html</strong> at <strong>project/templates</strong> and it looks like this instead:</p>
<pre><code>**{% extends 'main/header.html' %}**
{% load i18n %}

{% block content %}

//
</code></pre>
<p>My <strong>urls.py</strong> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>from allauth_2fa import views as allauth_2fa_views
app_name = "project"

urlpatterns = [

    path("setup/", allauth_2fa_views.TwoFactorSetup.as_view(), name="setup"),
    // Other urls
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your base.html write:</p>
<pre><code>{% include 'main/header.html' %}
</code></pre>
<p>and don't forget to write at the top in the template (setup.html)</p>
<pre><code>{% extends 'base.html' %}
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem is that i don't know where that base.html comes from. I only have a setup.html but not a base.html</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Check the first line of your setup.html, it seems like that's the line of code you have :  {% extends 'base.html' %}</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I will still get the error, the problem is that my setup.html and the file where the error is, are two different files</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you need to give us more information, like what folder or directory did you create in your templates folder. Are you using the setup.html as a Master Page or base.html ? Where have you saved the header.html ? ..... etc.  Only if you give me a little more information i will be able to help you.  Thank you !</span>
