<p>I am running my Python script using Pycharm on Mac.
The script is reading, processing and plotting some data.</p>
<p>When I place a debug point(often shortly after I plotted some charts), I encountered "python quit unexpectedly". My debugger logged:
"called Tcl_FindHashEntry on deleted table"</p>
<p>Would you please help? I want the program to stop at the debug point, instead of quitting.</p>

<p>Your error looks like its coming from the backend of MatPlotLib. Here is an <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/7743" rel="nofollow noreferrer">open bug</a> which references the same error. The bug may or may not be what you are experiencing, but has to do with window sizing and multiple screens. </p>
<p>As troubleshooting: </p>
<ol>
<li>If multiple monitors or a dock are in use, try removing them from the equation. </li>
<li>Use Windows to examine breakpoint. (Bug appears Mac-specific.) </li>
