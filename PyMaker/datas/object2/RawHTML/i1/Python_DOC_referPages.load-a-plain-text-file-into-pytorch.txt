<p>I have two separate files, one is a text file, with each line being a single text. The other file contains the class label of that corresponding line. How do I load this into PyTorch and carry out further tokenization, embedding, etc? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What have you tried already? What you described is still not very PyTorch related, you can make a pre-processing script that loads all the sentences into single data structured, e.g.: a list of (text, label) tuple.You can also already split your data into training and hold-out set in this step. You can then dump all this into .csv files.</p>
<p>Then, one way to do it is in 3 steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the class <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/utils/data/dataset.html#Dataset" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dataset</a> - to load efficiently your data, reading the produced .csv files;</li>
<li>Have another like <strong>Vocabulary</strong> that keeps a mapping from tokens to ids and vice-verse;</li>
<li>Something like a <strong>Vectorizer</strong>, that converts your sentences into vectors, either one-hot-encondings or embeddings;</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you can use this to produce a vector representation of your sentences a pass it to a neural network.</p>
<p>Look into this notebook to understand all this in more detail:</p>
