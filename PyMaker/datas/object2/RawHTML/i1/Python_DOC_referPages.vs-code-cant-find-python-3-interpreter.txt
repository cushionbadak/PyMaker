<p>I am installing Python 3.7.2 for the first time, and I'm using the VS Code python extension.</p>
<p>When I run <code>python -V</code> I get <code>Python 2.7.10</code> which is not correct!</p>
<p>When I select the <code>usr/local/bin/python3</code> interpreter in VS Code I get this error when running a script:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bash: /Users/erik/Work/Python/usr/local/bin/python3: No such file or directory</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But when I look in <code>usr/local/bin</code> I can see that Python3 is there. I'm not sure why VS Code pastes the work directory in front of <code>usr/local/bin</code> ?</p>
<p>My first thought was that Python3 should be in the PATH variable so I ran the included <code>Update Shell Profile</code> command, which gives this feedback: </p>
<pre><code>This script will update your shell profile when 
the 'bin' directory of python is not early enough
of the PATH of your shell. 

All right, you're a python lover already
</code></pre>
<p>Now, after rebooting VS Code I get a new option for selecting an interpreter:</p>
<p><code>/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3</code></p>
<p>Is that different from the Python in <code>usr/local/bin</code> ? When I select it, I get this error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The script isort is installed in '/Users/erik/Library/Python/3.7/bin' which is not on PATH.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also get this sideways related error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are using pip version 18.1. You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, when following these instructions I get yet another error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bash: pip: command not found</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All in all, this process and the official documentation seem less than user-friendly? Apparently I'm required to dig deep through my mac's system files in the terminal before even writing one line of code.</p>
<p>Am I missing an essential step here?</p>

<p>I suggest that you use virtual environment for your project
first</p>
<p><code>pip install virtualenv</code></p>
<p>open cmd in your project directory that <strong>you open in VS-Code</strong> (it's important that vs-code sees this virtualenv folder that we will create)</p>
<p><code>mkvirtualenv my_env</code></p>
<p>and it will activate it automatically. if not run</p>
<p><code>my_env/bin/Scripts/activate or my_env/Scripts/activate</code></p>
<p>Then go open vs-code then <strong>select my_env for python interpreter</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Well, if you want to change your default Python version for the whole system, it might break some applications that are depending on Python 2. </p>
<p>You can alias the commands by adding this line to your <code>~/.bash_profile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ alias python='python3'
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>python</code> command will now refer to <code>python3</code>. </p>
<p>If you want to execute the original Python (which refers to <code>python2</code>), you can escape the alias (so <code>\python</code> will launch <code>python2</code> without touching the alias).</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Btw.</strong></p>
<pre><code>$ unlink /usr/local/bin/python
$ ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3.7 /usr/local/bin/python
</code></pre>
<p>could also be a workaround for you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How did you install Python (from <a href="https://www.python.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python.org</a>? did you build it from source? or are you using the version that comes with your OS)? Have you tried to set the Python path manually by adding <code>"python.pythonPath": "/usr/local/bin/python3"</code> to your <code>settings.json</code>? If that don't work, use the path that <code>which python3</code> outputs and add that one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can try opening up your .bashrc and add the path that it says is missing. As for pip, you can probably get it to run with pip2 or pip3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How did you run python?  Try right clicking when cursor is over the editor window, Select  "run Python file in Terminal".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Joey ah, that's where the <code>Library/Frameworks/</code> path in VS Code suddenly comes from! (apparently VS Code found that path automatically). BUT, is this correct? Shouldn't this be <code>usr/local/bin/</code> ???</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bashrc hmm, I have the idea that I'm adding paths all over my system. There is a .bash file, a .profile file, a .bash_profile file, and now a .bashrc file? Which should I use?</span>
