<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to use <code>==</code> to match against multiple results.</p>
<p>Here is my line in question:</p>
<pre><code>if string1.lower().rstrip() == "remove from list" or "del from list":
    do something
else:
    do something else
</code></pre>
<p>I want to match exactly "remove from list" exactly, or pass on to a different function, or match "del from list" exactly or pass on to a different function.</p>
<p>to add to the example, the 'pass on to different function I mentioned would be...</p>
<p><code>if string1.lower().rstrip() == "remove from list me" or "del from list me"</code></p>
<p>so it is important to match exacty which is why im using == instead of an alternative like 'in'</p>
<p>I also want to be able to expand whatever method works here to be able to match 4, 5, 6 strings as needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use either <code>in</code> with a list of the strings you want to match, it's <code>True</code> iff the string is equal to one of the strings in the list:</p>
<pre><code>if string1.lower().rstrip() in ["remove from list", "del from list"]:
</code></pre>
<p>Or use <code>==</code> twice:</p>
<pre><code>if string1.lower().rstrip() == "remove from list" or string1.lower().rstrip() == "del from list"]:
</code></pre>
<p>This, <code>string1.lower().rstrip() == "remove from list" or "del from list"</code>, will always evaluate to <code>True</code>, the <code>else</code> will never be reached, because the Boolean of a non-empty string is <code>True</code>, so it's equivalent to <code>string1.lower().rstrip() == "remove from list" or True</code>, which it always <code>True</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">would using...  if string1.lower().rstrip() in ["remove from list", "del from list"]: show as true if string1 was just remove?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ProgD No, it will be True only if <code>string1.lower().rstrip()</code> is exactly equal to one of the strings in the list <code>["remove from list", "del from list"]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead of a list, use <code>in</code> keyword with tuple <code>if string1.lower().rstrip() in ("remove from list", "del from list")</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok thanks very much, that is the only reason I wasn't using 'in'. Thanks for clarifying, sometimes I overthink and become blind to the obvious lol</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ProgD the <code>in</code> you were thinking about is this, <code>string1.lower().rstrip() in "remove from list"</code>, it's when both operands are strings, <code>str in str</code>.</span>
