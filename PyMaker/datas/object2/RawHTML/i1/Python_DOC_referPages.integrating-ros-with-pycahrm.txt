<p>I wanted to run ROS in PyCharm, but could not find that .desktop file as mentioned <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/IDEs#PyCharm_.28community_edition.29" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> in which changes should be made. Moreover, I want to use the same environment that is created for <code>PyTorch</code>, do not want to change the interpreter. Can someone help me out with this? </p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>You could add a virtual environment with the following instructions, then you should add ROS distpackages (<code>roslib</code>) on it with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/24206781/3702377">this instruction</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>File</em> &gt; <em>Settings</em> (or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> as shortcut)&gt; <em>Project: </em> &gt; <em>Project interpreter</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>In the project interpreter dropdown list, you can specify <em>ROS Python</em> interpreter by selecting the appropriate from the list.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>ROS distpackages path that you need: <code>/opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/distpackages</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your reply. But by changing the interpretter I will loose my PyTorch environment which I created, Moreover I am using Python 3.6 for PyTorch and ROS is having Python 2.7, Will that be a problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should gather all repositories such as <code>rospkg</code>, <code>pytorch</code> and <code>python3</code> on an environment and use this path.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the answer I will try that if I feel any difficulty I will get back to you.</span>
