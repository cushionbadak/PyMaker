<p>I know there are some similar questions on here but I haven't been able to find a solution that works for me. I have the following curl request that works from Command Prompt: </p>
<pre><code>curl -G -d api_token=[TOKEN1] -d access_token=[TOKEN2] https://api.indiegogo.com/2/accounts/[PAGE_ID]/contributions.json
</code></pre>
<p>But when I translate it into the following python code, it returns a 404 error.</p>
<pre><code> data = {
  'api_token':'[TOKEN1]',
  'access_token':'[TOKEN2]'
 }

response = requests.post('https://api.indiegogo.com/2/accounts/[ID]/contributions.json', data=data)
</code></pre>
<p>I think it might have something to do with the headers, but I have played around with it and can't figure out how to make it work. Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>As per <a href="http://developer.indiegogo.com/docs/campaign-contributions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">API documentation</a>, you need to pass <code>api_token</code> and <code>access_token</code> as query string to api using <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#passing-parameters-in-urls" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>params</code></a> parameter.</p>
<pre><code>data = {
  'api_token':'[TOKEN1]',
  'access_token':'[TOKEN2]'
 }

response = requests.get('https://api.indiegogo.com/2/accounts/[ID]/contributions.json', params=data)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Vivek, but this did not solve the problem. I am still getting a 404 error. Any other ideas?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually this did fix it, but I also needed to change to a requests.get.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah updated answer based on that, 404 means either <code>ID</code> you're passing is wrong or call you're doing is not possible</span>
