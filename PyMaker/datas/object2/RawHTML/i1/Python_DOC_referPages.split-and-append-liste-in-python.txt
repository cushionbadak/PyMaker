<p>Ok so here is what I am trying to do. I have a List A which has the folowing elements. I want to modify this list A such that every element in A shall be preceded with its character count. for example, a1 becomes 02a1 and aa1 becomes 03aa1 so on and so forth.</p>
<pre><code>A = "a1,b1,c1,a2,b2,c2,aa1,ab1,ac1" 
A = A.split(',')
A.append('bb1')
print(A)
for evry_element in A:
   q = [len(evry_element)]
   for ev_el in evry_element:
       q.append(ord(ev_el))
   print(q)    
</code></pre>
<p>This code is working for me but the result I get is this:</p>
<pre><code>['a1', 'b1', 'c1', 'a2', 'b2', 'c2', 'aa1', 'ab1', 'ac1', 'bb1']
[2, 97]
[2, 97, 49]
[2, 98]
[2, 98, 49]
[2, 99]
[2, 99, 49]
[2, 97]
[2, 97, 50]
[2, 98]
[2, 98, 50]
[2, 99]
[2, 99, 50]
[3, 97]
[3, 97, 97]
[3, 97, 97, 49]
[3, 97]
[3, 97, 98]
[3, 97, 98, 49]
[3, 97]
[3, 97, 99]
[3, 97, 99, 49]
[3, 98]
[3, 98, 98]
[3, 97, 99, 49]
</code></pre>
<p>But I want the result to be in a single string like this:</p>
<pre><code>A_new = [2, 97, 49,2, 98, 49,2, 99, 49,2, 97, 50,2, 98, 50,2, 99, 50,3, 97, 97, 49,3, 97, 98, 49,3, 97, 99, 49,3, 97, 99, 49]
</code></pre>
<p>What Should I do?
I hope did my best in explaining what I want to do.</p>

<p>I think this is what you're trying to achieve:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>A = "a1,b1,c1,a2,b2,c2,aa1,ab1,ac1" 
A = A.split(',')
A.append('bb1')
print(A)
q = []
for evry_element in A:
   q.append('0' + str(len(evry_element)) + evry_element)
print(q)
</code></pre>
<p>Though I'm not sure why you decided to append <code>bb1</code>. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Howdy! Please see the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> definition in the Help Center -- a good question involving code shows us an example we can run to see your <i>exact</i> problem, with no unrelated errors (so you should be using real Python syntax, not pseudocode).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you wish to do if the string is longer than 99 characters?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's hard to tell what your desired output is. Is that... a list with one single massively long string inside?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, is there any chance of any of these strings containing non-ascii characters? If so, you should encode the strings to bytes <i>before</i> getting their length.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aran-Fey Yes, thats exactly what I want. i want to make a list with one single massively long string and then convert it into bytearray.</span>
