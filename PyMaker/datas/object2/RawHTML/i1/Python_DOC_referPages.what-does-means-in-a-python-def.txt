<p>This might be a very stupid question but I can't understand what the three dots stands for in a python <code>def</code>. I was trying to comprehend the cost of the <code>in</code> operator in a <code>deque</code> object (from the <code>collections</code> module), so I navigated through the code and here's what I found:</p>

<p>I thought they mean the method will use the "upper" definition when called, but if I navigate to the overridden method I can't find nothing if not an abstract method in the <code>Container</code> class.. so I still don't get how the <code>in</code> operator works on a <code>deque</code> object.</p>

<p>You are looking at a .pyi stub file. Referring to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41734836/what-does-i-represent-in-python-pyi-extension">this post</a>, a stub file, as the name suggests, is only meant to describe the interface and not the implementation inside. Hence, <code>...</code> in a Python def really means that this file is just a def and you cannot find the implementation here. </p>
<p>Regarding your question about the cost of <code>in</code> operator in <code>deque</code>, refer to <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity</a></p>
<p>It mentions <code>deque</code> is represented internally as a doubly-linked list, and also mentions that <code>in</code> operator for a <code>list</code> has O(n) complexity. I don't think it being a doubly-linked list changes the time complexity, as you would still need to go through each element, i.e., O(n).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@RegisterSole There's nothing about <code>...</code> in that question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is your question?  The meaning of '...' in .pyi files or the performance of <code>spam in mydeque</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Barmar Based on the answer there, a .pyi file describes the interface of the module <b>without</b> any implementation. Hence, <code>...</code> really means ... in ordinary text. That is, the part of the text is deliberately omitted as it is irrelevant.</span>
