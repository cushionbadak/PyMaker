<p>I'm working with binary classification on a very imbalanced dataset and when I export my decision tree to graphviz using <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.export_graphviz.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">export_graphviz</a> and setting <code>filled</code> to <code>True</code> all the nodes of tree are filled with the same color. Is there a way to make the color vary with higher probabilities of belonging to the alternative class?</p>

<h1>Option 1: Modify dot output</h1>
<p>Would it be a possibility to (maybe automatically) modify the dot output? Once you can identify the nodes in question, you could add (or adapt) the fillcolor attribute for those nodes.</p>
<h1>Option 2: configuration in sklearn</h1>
<p>I do not know details about sklearn. But from the page you linked, many settings sound interesting, especially these:</p>
<ul>
<li>impurity</li>
<li>label</li>
<li>class_names</li>
</ul>
