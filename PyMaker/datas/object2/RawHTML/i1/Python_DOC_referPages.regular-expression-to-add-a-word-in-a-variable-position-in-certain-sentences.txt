<p>I have an embarrassingly rookie question, but I think I'm stuck and can't think straight. </p>
<p>I want a regular expression pattern that will add the word <code>'old'</code> after the word <code>'year'</code> or <code>'years'</code>, only if the word <code>'child'</code> or <code>'children'</code> is also present in the sentence (a pattern I detected in my data). </p>
<p>So:</p>
<p><em>'Especially in children who are one year or up to twelve years old, for seven years.'</em></p>
<p>will have 'old' added after the fist 'year', but not an extra one added after the second old, and also not after the two final words:</p>
<p><em>'Especially in children who are one year <strong>old</strong> or up tp twelve years old, for seven years.'</em></p>
<p>My patterns so far have managed to all be wrong, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code>if 'child' or 'children' in i.split() and 'old' or 'olds' not in  i.split(): 
    i=re.sub(r'year' ,'year old',i)
</code></pre>
<p>Any ideas? Thanks :)</p>

<pre><code>import re
i = 'Especially in children who are one year or up to twelve years old, for seven years.'
if re.search(r'(\bchild\b)|(\bchildren\b)',i):
    re.sub('(years{0,1}) (?!old)',r'\1 old ',i)
</code></pre>
<p>Which gives:</p>
<pre><code>'Especially in children who are one year old or up to twelve years old, for seven years.'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Same i solution i thought. +1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see.. Much simpler than I thought, as usual. Great, many thanks, I'll play around with it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On side note:- it's better to use <code>?</code> instead of <code>{0,1}</code>, and the <code>(\bchild\b)|(\bchildren\b)</code> can be reduced to <code>\b(?:child(?:ren)?)\b</code></span>
