<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm writing a calculator, in Python, to calculate all 4 operations, (Add, Sub, Mul, and Div); I need to create a function that would return results of the 4 operations in a dictionary: result = all(n1,n2), for example all(4,2); this is to return something like this: result["add":6, "sub":2, "mul":8, "div": 2]; to print as: 4 + 2 = 6, 4 - 2 = 2, 4 * 2 = 8, 4 / 2 = 2
Thanks.</p>

<p>I do not think you want a "dictionary". Dictionaries can only have 1 key and 1 definition. However if you use pandas and a data-frame you can store all of these.</p>
