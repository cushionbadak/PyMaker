<p>I'm trying to retrieve emails via a python script. I was looking to see if there's a way to retrieve them and display into an HTML inbox page. I know that I could just log onto my email and see my inbox, but I still want to see if I can retrieve my emails and render it in readable form.</p>

<p>Assuming you're trying to retrieve your Gmail inbox, Google's Gmail API is perfect for that use case.</p>
<p>First of all, here's the setup instructions for Python:
<a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python</a></p>
<p>Once you've got your Gmail project set up (including signing up and getting an API key), you can retrieve an inbox from the <code>Users.messages</code> data. The example Gmail uses in the first link (quickstart) retrieves Users.labels, so it should be a pretty basic modification to retrieve Users.messages using the same syntax.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Gmail has a REST API which you could use to easily retrieve JSON data using a simple HTTP request. See here:
<a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/v1/reference/</a></p>
<p>Note: if you're going the HTTP request route, then you might as well use JQuery (Javascript library) to execute an HTTP request using the <code>$.get()</code> and/or <code>$.post()</code> methods.</p>
