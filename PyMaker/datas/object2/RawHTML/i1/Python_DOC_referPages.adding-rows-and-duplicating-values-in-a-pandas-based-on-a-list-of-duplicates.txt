<p>So here's my daily challenge :</p>
<p>I have an Excel file containing a list of streets, and some of those streets will be doubled (or tripled) based on their road type. For instance :</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/by2pS.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="Example of duplicates" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/by2pS.png"/></a></p>
<p>In another Excel file, I have the street names (without duplicates) and their mean distances between features such as this :</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F1MEK.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F1MEK.png"/></a></p>
<p>Both Excel files have been converted to pandas dataframes as so :</p>
<pre><code>duplicates_df = pd.DataFrame()
duplicates_df['Street_names'] = street_names


dist_df=pd.DataFrame()
dist_df['Street_names'] = names_dist_values
dist_df['Mean_Dist'] = dist_values
dist_df['STD'] = std_values
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to find a way to append the values of mean distance and STD many times in the duplicates_df whenever a street has more than one occurence, but I am struggling with the proper syntax. This is probably an easy fix, but I've never done this before.</p>
<p>The desired output would be : </p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F0iAQ.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/F0iAQ.png"/></a></p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
