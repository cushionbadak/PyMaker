<p>I am totally new to tkinter and I am trying to dispaly multiple images that the user can scroll to see them all here my best try:</p>
<pre><code>from Tkinter import *
import os
from PIL import ImageTk, Image

n = 128
path = "/media/mark/B37B-0280/img5/test/mm"
images = []
photos = []
cas = []
root = Tk()
frame = Frame(root)
frame.grid(row=0)
names = [name for name in os.listdir(path)]
images = [Image.open(path + "/" + name).resize((n, n)) for name in names]
photos = [ImageTk.PhotoImage(image) for image in images]
canvas = Canvas(frame, bg="yellow", width=n*len(names), height=n*len(names))
canvas.grid(row=0, sticky="news")
cas = [Canvas(canvas, width=n, height=n) for p in photos]

i = 0
for c, im in zip(cas, photos):
    c.create_image(n/2, n/2, image=im)
    c.grid(row=i)
    i += 1
vsb = Scrollbar(frame, orient="vertical", command=canvas.yview)
vsb.grid(row=0, column=1, sticky='ns')
canvas.configure(yscrollcommand=vsb.set)
root.mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>as you see there is a scroll bar but not working, what is wrong? how to fix it?</p>
<p>The images are displayed properly but the scrolling is not working</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As explained in the answer to and comments on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54222125/canvas-bbox-method-returns-none-although-widgets-exist-inside">this question</a>, widgets that are placed inside a canvas are not automatically canvas items. For this, a <code>canvas.create_window</code>command needs to be used, as explained <a href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm#Tkinter.Canvas.create_window-method" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. I will edit my code at the end of this answer to make it work as intended.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When adding a <code>Scrollbar</code>to a <code>Canvas</code>in tkinter, it can be necessary to pass an additional argument called <code>scrollregion</code> - the Canvas has to "know" which part of it's coordinate system you want to scroll to. So adding </p>
<pre><code>canvas.config(scrollregion=canvas.bbox(ALL))
</code></pre>
<p>should make it work as intended.
<code>canvas.bbox</code>specifies a region (<a href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/pythondoc-tkinter-canvas.htm#Tkinter.Canvas.bbox-method" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bounding box</a>) of the canvas, <code>ALL</code> simply specifies the bounding box for all items. </p>
<p>Apart from that, just a few general hints: you can remove the </p>
<pre><code>images = []
photos = []
cas = []
</code></pre>
<p>part in your code, because you define these lists later anyway. Also, even creating these lists isn't necessary (at least with how your code is structured right now, if you need to do something with them later it can of course be useful), you can put all of that inside one loop (Code not tested!) <strong>now edited</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>from Tkinter import *
import os
from PIL import ImageTk, Image

n = 128
path = "/media/mark/B37B-0280/img5/test/mm"
root = Tk()
frame = Frame(root, width=n*number, height=n*number).grid(row=0)

number = len(os.listdir(path))
canvas = Canvas(frame, bg="yellow", width=n*number, height=n*number)

i = 0
for name in os.listdir(path):
    image = Image.open(path + "/" + name).resize((n, n))
    photo = ImageTk.PhotoImage(image)
    c = Canvas(canvas, width=n, height=n)
    c.create_image(n/2, n/2, image=photo)
    canvas.create_window(0, n*i, window=c)
    i += 1

vsb = Scrollbar(frame, orient=VERTICAL)
vsb.pack(side=RIGHT, fill=Y)
vsb.config(command=canvas.yview)
canvas.config(width=n * number, height=n * number)
canvas.config(yscrollcommand=vsb.set, scrollregion=canvas.bbox(ALL))
canvas.pack(side=LEFT,expand=True,fill=BOTH)

<span class="comment-copy">What exactly isn't working? are the images displayed properly, and just the scrolling doesn`t work, or what's your specific problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Flob yes the images are displayed properly but the scrolling does not work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did an edit on my answer, it should work now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">all what I get now is gray window with scrollbar but no images that is weird</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I had to change  Canvas(canvas, w=n, h=n) to  Canvas(canvas, width=n, height=n) but not showing the images now any idea?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">right, sorry. Edited it accordingly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you use all of your original code, and just add <code>canvas.config(scrollregion=canvas.bbox(ALL))</code>, does it work? i didn't get to test my answer yet, so it could be that i slipped an error into the code...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried your code after you edited it still no images appear in the window and all I got is gray window and scrollbar with nothing else. I noticed that bbox is returning none.</span>
