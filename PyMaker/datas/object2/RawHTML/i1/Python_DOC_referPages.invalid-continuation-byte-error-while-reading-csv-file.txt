<p>I'm trying to read a csv file using python on jupyter notebook using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>data = pandas.read_csv("/Users/noha/Desktop/SongCSV.csv")
</code></pre>
<p>however, I keep getting this error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xed in position 5: invalid continuation byte</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't understand why this is happening.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you mention the encoding it will be solve:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('/Users/noha/Desktop/SongCSV.csv', encoding='utf-8')

</code></pre>
<p>If face any problem comment below</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">There's invalid encoding in the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you post csv file too ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your CSV file is not UTF-8. What program did you create it with? If it was a program like Excel on Windows, CP-1252 is a reasonable encoding to try. But fundamentally you need to know the encoding before you can read <i>any</i> text file, whether CSV or anything else.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please, see this: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54455487/python-failure-on-output-redirect-pipe/54455794#54455794" title="python failure on output redirect pipe">stackoverflow.com/questions/54455487/â€¦</a> I think it may be useful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The error message indicates that it's already using the <code>utf-8</code> codec.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then has to check its encoding system.. does your csv file opensource? Then I can find out the solutions by test it on my pc</span>
