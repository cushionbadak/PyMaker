<p>I just spent a lot of time trying to follow the basics of using fabric to establish a connection to a remote machine. I'm using a raspberry pi 3, it has python 2.7 installed on it, and fabric 1.13.1. I can successfully run a hello world function using a fabfile, but can't actually write a python script that establishes a connection to a remote machine, whether in the live python debugger or in a standalone python file. I dont even try to establish the connection. I just try to import Connection from fabric. Example:</p>
<pre><code>from fabric import Connection
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>import fabric
c = fabric.Connection("192.168.0.1")
</code></pre>
<p>This always results in the error:</p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Connection'
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what to do. When I look inside the directory of the fabric source, there is nothing named Connection. What am I doing wrong here?</p>
<p>Note: I am following the tutorial at: <a href="http://www.fabfile.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.fabfile.org/</a></p>

<p>You are using Fabric v.1.X, in which the API is not OO, and the <code>fabric</code> module doesn't even have a <code>Connection</code> attribute.</p>
<p>In order to benefit from the <code>Connection</code> attribute, you have to use fabric v2.X, which is the version documented in fabfile.org</p>
<p>However, this version is not compatible with Python 2.X</p>
<p>If you really need to stick with Python 2.X, you have to use the <code>env</code> dictionary</p>
<pre><code>from fabric.api import env

env.hosts = ['192.168.0.1']

# Your remaining code here
</code></pre>
<p>For more info, please refer to Fabric 1.13 docs <a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.13/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>
