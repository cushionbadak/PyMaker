<p>I'm trying to have the output of Platforms for A321 and Days less than or equal to 14 to print out the following 'Mods Applicable' but it's not ouputting that Platforms AND the Days. </p>

<p>Try using "&amp;" instead of "and":</p>
<pre><code>df = pd.DataFrame({'Platform': ['A123', 'A321', 'A321', 'B123'],
                   'Days': [10, 13, 20, 5]})

df.loc[(df['Platform'] == 'A321') &amp; (df['Days'] &lt;= 14), 'Mods Applicable'] = 'CFM56 9th Stage Duct'

print(df)

      Platform  Days       Mods Applicable
    0     A123    10                   NaN
    1     A321    13  CFM56 9th Stage Duct
    2     A321    20                   NaN
    3     B123     5                   NaN

<p>I can reproduce the same error by using "and" instead of "&amp;":</p>

<p>This is because comparing a <code>Series</code> to a value also returns a <code>Series</code>. Which means that the results of <code>(df['Platform'] == 'A321')</code> and <code>(df['Days'] &lt;= 14)</code> are <code>Series</code> of <code>true/false</code> values and it doesn't resolve to a single true or false by default. So you can't <code>and</code> it!</p>
<p>You can replace the <code>and</code> with <code>&amp;</code>. So it would become:</p>
<pre><code>df.loc[(df['Platform'] == 'A321') &amp; (df['Days'] &lt;= 14), 'Mods Applicable'] = 'CFM56 9th Stage Duct'

<span class="comment-copy">There is nothing wrong with the code as far as I can see. It won't print/output anything unless you ask it to. There is no context here to work with; what exactly is the issue?</span>
