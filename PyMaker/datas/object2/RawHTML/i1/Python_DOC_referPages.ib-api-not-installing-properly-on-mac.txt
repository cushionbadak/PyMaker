<p>So I'm trying to use the IB API wrapper from <a href="https://github.com/erdewit/ib_insync" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> and I try running the first line   </p>
<pre><code>from ib_insync import * 
</code></pre>
<p>but am getting the following error:</p>
<p><code>Traceback (most recent call last):</code>
<code>File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ib_insync/__init__.py", line 10, in &lt;module&gt;</code>
<code>import ibapi</code>
<code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ibapi'</code></p>
<p><code>During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:</code></p>
<p><code>Traceback (most recent call last):</code>
<code>File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;</code>
<code>File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ib_insync/__init__.py", line 13, in &lt;module&gt;</code>
<code>'IB API from http://interactivebrokers.github.io is required')</code>
<code>RuntimeError: IB API from http://interactivebrokers.github.io is required</code></p>
<p>but I've downloaded the IB API from the IB <a href="http://interactivebrokers.github.io/#" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github</a> (had to use The Unarchiver to unzip) and saved it on my desktop. As far as I can tell there's no pip3 command I can use to install it so I'm not sure what else I can do to install the IB API. I've allowed ticked all the boxes for the API in TWS. I'm not sure why it's not installing properly? </p>
<p>It seems to be the same issue found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48485442/encounter-error-ib-api-required-when-ib-api-is-installed">here</a> but mine is for macosx. I've tried running the commands from README.md and they don't work. It just says no such directory exists. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Installing the a python module as a wheel is optional- its also possible to just include the path to the module in the PYTHONPATH environment variable. But if you're using the commands from the READ.ME to build and install a wheel, make sure you're in the pythonclient folder and then run: </p>
<p>python3 setup.py bdist_wheel<br/>
  python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade dist/ibapi-9.75.1-py3-none-any.whl</p>
<p>Thats for the current API Latest version as of March 2019 which is 975.1</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The possible error is your install path is not in <code>sys.path</code>. Try adding it before importing</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks. How would I go about doing that?</span>
