<p>I have script1.py which does some calculations and sends some emails and script2.py (is used to do some updated in a Mysql DB) which is in an infinite loop until some things are satisfied.</p>
<p>At the end of the calculations made on script1, I need to execute script2.py and to do this I am using <code>subprocess.Popen(["python", "script2.py"])</code> now when debugging this, I see that it goes inside script2 and it works but when the execution of script1 ends I see that the script2.py stops its execution.</p>
<p>Is there another module used to do this kind of things, because it's not working properly ? </p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I need to execute script1.py in order to execute script2.py but when using subprocess.Popen() the script1 waits for the script2 to terminate the execution. I need a way to execute script2 and let it run and terminate script1</p>

<p>After adding in <code>process.wait()</code> to script_1.py:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess

process.wait()
print("CONTROLLER TERMINATED")

<span class="comment-copy">You need to specifically wait until the command run with <code>popen</code> has completed. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28284715/python-subprocess-popen-wait-for-completion">this</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why dont you <code>import script2</code> and call it directly?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think this is the same as the one referenced by +FlyingTeller, this one seems more appropriate but it depends what Script2 is doing: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27624850/launch-a-completely-independent-process" title="launch a completely independent process">stackoverflow.com/questions/27624850/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FlyingTeller I need to start an independent process and subprocess does not do that</span>
