<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are rows of text data like the following:</p>
<pre><code>10/6/17, 19:49 - Alice: Where are you?
10/6/17, 19:48 - John: Coming
10/6/17, 19:54 - Alice: I'm downstairs. Call at
246735435
</code></pre>
<p>What is the regex to extract just the date and time of each row.
For instance I need to match "10/6/17, 19:49" for the first row and in the last row "246735435" should not be matched.</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>

<p>This is a very good question, as RegEx is hard to understand. Here it is: </p>
<p><code>(\d{1,2})/(\d{1,2})/(\d{2})</code></p>
<p>This can be split up into 2 groups: </p>
<p>1) \d{1,2} -- catch 1-2 digits</p>
<p>2) \d{2} -- catch 2 digits</p>
<p>Then there is a / in between them, for date formatting. Note that you now have: </p>
<ul>
<li>Group 1 = month</li>
<li>Group 2 = day</li>
<li>Group 3 = year</li>
</ul>
<p>A good resource for learning/testing RegEx is <a href="http://regexr.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RegExr</a>, where you can test your expressions with cheatsheets/references on the side</p>
