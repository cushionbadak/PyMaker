<p>I am looking for a way to solve the problem below in Python,php or javascript.</p>
<p>I would like to know what approach / algorithm / ML Model 
to use to get me on track 
and being able get these pink edges detected and then mesure distances.</p>
<p>is Canny edge detection a good approach ?
or ultrametric contour map ?</p>
<p>I have no clue right now.</p>
<p>Here is an illustration of what i'm trying to achieve</p>

<p>Looklike <strong>OpenCV</strong> contour detecttion is the Way to go.</p>
<p>doesn't look so bad as a starting point :</p>

<p>using this a first step</p>
<pre><code>ret,thresh1 = cv2.threshold(img,220,255,cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
ret,thresh2 = cv2.threshold(img,220,255,cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)
</code></pre>
