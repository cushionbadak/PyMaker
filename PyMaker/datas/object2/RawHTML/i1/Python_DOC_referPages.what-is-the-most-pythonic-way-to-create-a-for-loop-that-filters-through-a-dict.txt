<p>I am looking to search for and then append an item through a dictionary (named: songs) that contains a list of tracks. However, this dictionary has multiple levels and indices. Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>artists = []

for i in range(len(songs['tracks'])):
     artist.append(songs['tracks'][i]['artists'][0]['name'])
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a more pythonic way of writing this code? I feel as though using 
<code>in range(len(songs['tracks']))</code> is not the best way to achieve this, but it does the job.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One solution equivalent to your code may be</p>
<pre><code>artists = [track['artists'][0]['name'] for track in songs['tracks']]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First of all, what you're doing there is actually a "map" operation (transforming the items of one array into another array/list), not a "filter" operation (removing certain items that match a condition from an array/list).</p>
<p>Second, you shouldn't be looping over a range. This is a <code>for in</code> loop, not a traditional <code>for</code> loop, so there's no index. Instead, each iteration contains the item in the list/array.</p>
<pre><code>artists = []
for track in songs['tracks']:
    artists.append(track['artists'][0]['name'])
</code></pre>
<p>You can turn this into a one liner using <a href="https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Comprehensions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehensions</a>. They take the common premise of iterating over a list to create a new list, possibly transforming the results and possibly filtering the results. The syntax they use is:</p>
<pre><code>result = [ &lt;transformation&gt; for item in items if &lt;condition&gt; ]
</code></pre>
<p>In your case you don't have an explicit need for a condition since you're simply mapping one set of array values to another, like this:</p>
<pre><code>artists = [ track[artists][0]['name'] for track in songs['tracks'] ]
</code></pre>
<p>However, if you were filtering, that if condition would be what you'd use. For example</p>
<pre><code>artists_with_long_songs = [ track[artists][0]['name'] for track in songs['tracks'] if track['length'] &gt; 600 ]
</code></pre>
