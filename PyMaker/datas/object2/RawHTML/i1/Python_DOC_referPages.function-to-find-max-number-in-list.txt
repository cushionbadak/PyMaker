<p>I am trying to create a function which finds the max number in a list (without using the max() command)</p>
<p>however my function doesn't work for negative numbers I don't think? how do I fix this? thanks! for example in my second print test it prints  0 instead of -3. </p>
<pre><code>def my_max(data):
    """finds max number in list"""
    maximum = 0 
    for num in data:
        if num &gt; maximum:
            maximum = num
    return maximum 
print(my_max([11, 99, 3, -6]))
print(my_max([-3, -5, -9, -10]))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You have 2 solutions to that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting a ridiculously big negative number as initial maximum like <code>-10000000</code> (won't work in any case and is ugly) or <code>-math.inf</code> (will work in any case but is still ugly)</li>
<li><p>Putting the first item of your list as initial maximum (<code>data[0]</code>) (will work in any case).</p>
<p>Explanation for this 2nd solution : If the first item of your list is the biggest one, the condition will always resolve to <code>False</code> and this inital maximum will be returned, or, it'll replace it by an other bigger item in the list and finally return the biggest.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is because you are initializing you maximum variable with an arbitrary value (zero) that is already larger than -3.    Try initializing it with the first element in the list maximum = data[0]</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One of the more obscure number types in Python is <code>math.inf</code> -- infinity. This can be produced by:</p>
<p><code>from math import inf</code>, and then using <code>inf</code> or <code>-inf</code> (negative infinity), </p>
<p><strong>or</strong> </p>
<p><code>float("inf")</code> for positive infinity, and <code>float ("-inf")</code> for negative infinity</p>
</div>
