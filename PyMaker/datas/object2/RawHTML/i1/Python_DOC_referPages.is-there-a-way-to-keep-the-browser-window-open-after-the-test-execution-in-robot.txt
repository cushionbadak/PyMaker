<p>I am looking to keep the browser window open even after test execution. 
I would like to keep it open indefinitely. 
As of now , as a work around I am just using "Sleep" to keep the window from closing. </p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you !</p>

<p>Simple - do not call <code>Close Browser</code> at the end.</p>

<p>Ideally, the <em>WebDriver</em> service should stop once your script ends due to <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/py/selenium/webdriver/common/service.py#L174" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this code</a>.</p>
<p>However if you want <em>Chrome</em> and <em>ChromeDriver</em> to stay open afterwards, you can add the <em>experimental option</em> <strong><code>detach</code></strong>  when initializing the chromedriver.</p>
<p>Not sure about the <em>RobotFramework</em> syntax, but through <em>Selenium-Python</em> client you can:</p>
<pre><code>from selenium import webdriver

options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_experimental_option("detach", True)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=options, executable_path=r'C:\WebDrivers\chromedriver.exe')
driver.get('https://www.google.com/')
</code></pre>

<p>In a previous Stack Overflow question about connecting to the Chrome remote-debugging-port I provided <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53324533/6152737">an example for connecting</a> to a running chrome instance using it's Dev Port. </p>
<p>This will functionally do what you want and as such may be an alternative to no closing as suggested by @Todor and @Bryan. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">@Prune I think the dup  target <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42044315/how-to-keep-chrome-browser-window-open-after-selenium-script-finishes-on-python">discussion</a> was about <i>re-use the same window</i> while this specific question is about <i>keep the window from closing</i>, both of them seems to be different. Can you have a re-look please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks; I clicked on the wrong duplicate. This question <i>has</i> been handled many times.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> that closes the browser after it's finished. I'm willing to bet you're telling it to close.</span>
