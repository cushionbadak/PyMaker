<p>like i said i really don't understand what this error means and when i look it up it kind of confuses me because the code is not as simple as mine. i have somewhat of an idea what it means but if someone can help explain it to me that would be awesome. Im pretty sure it has to do with the last three lines and how p4 is not in the Point class but like i said im not sure. Thank you for your time.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The error message you're seeing means that you're expecting the p4 object to have the .dist method but the p4 object is a string object. I think what is confusing you is that p1, p2, and p3 are Point objects (so they have the .dist method) but when you execute the .midpt method to intantiate the p4 variable, the method is returning a string. It returns "(1.5,2.0)" vs Point(1.5,2.0). So if you want your code to work you should change the calc variable in the .midpt method to something like this:</p>
<p>calc = Point((x1+x2)/2), ((y1+y2)/2))</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It means <code>p4</code> is a string, not an object as you expect.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">p4 = p1.midpt(p3) The method returns a str. This is not a Point and has no dist(...) method.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes that worked and thank you for explaining it. ive been trying to figure out how to solve it for a while now.</span>
