<p>i have multiple csv files (n) with fixed headers and 100 rows, and i'm trying to calculate the average (or other things such as Min or Max) of all [i][j] elements of these tables and store it in one final csv table. I tried genfromtxt but it did not workout. Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
from numpy import genfromtxt


a=genfromtxt('C:\\Users\\my_pc\\Desktop\\a1.csv',delimiter=';' , skip_header=1, dtype=None, encoding='utf_8')
b=genfromtxt('C:\\Users\\my_pc\\Desktop\\a2.csv',delimiter=';' , skip_header=1, dtype=None, encoding='utf_8')
c=genfromtxt('C:\\Users\\my_pc\\Desktop\\a3.csv', delimiter=';' , skip_header=1, dtype=None, encoding='utf_8')

#average
d = (a + b+ c) /3
print(d)
</code></pre>
<p>which i get this error :</p>

<p>How can i do this ? and also please tell me, whether <code>genfromtxt</code> parameter is right or not?) </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
df=pd.read_csv("a1.csv")
for i in range(2,21):
       filename="a"+str(i)+".csv"
       df+=pd.read_csv(filename)
df=df/20
</code></pre>
<p>This should do the trick..</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you showed the content of your csv files as text (what they are) instead of through a spreadsheet image, we could try to reproduce... Remember, a csv file is a <b>text</b> file!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Serge Ballesta this spreadsheet something that i randomly generated in excel and saved it as csv. But it represent the exact format of my data</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is not the question. I can copy paste from a csv presented as text, but not from an image. It is much easier to help when the question contains a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Justice_Lords makes no difference as long as it wokrs better. but please remember that the final result should be in a data frame, so i can use it for further calculations. tnx</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One more question, how should i put this in a for loop, because i have 20 data sets , could you help me with that as well?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SaeidHedayati Can you try now?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry for the late respond. I tried it  but i just keep getting this error <code>TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'float' and 'str'</code> .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SaeidHedayati You have to post full code so that I can help you. But I think it would be better if you post another question with sample datasets. Maybe try to load the data individually and check for its <b>type</b>. I think this problem has something to do type conversion. Try to convert "str" to "float" before adding.</span>
