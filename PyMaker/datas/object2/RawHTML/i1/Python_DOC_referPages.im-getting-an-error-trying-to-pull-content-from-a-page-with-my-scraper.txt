<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The issue is, the class of the HTML that I'm trying to pull from has a dash in it. Python is unable to read that dash correctly, so it's not able to pull the data that I need. </p>
<p>How do I write it so that Python can correctly read the dash and pull my data?</p>
<pre><code>print(page_content.bid-price)  # Here's the dash "bid-price"
time.sleep(2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Presumably you're seeing something like:</p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: 'Xxx' object has no attribute 'bid'
</code></pre>
<p>That's because <code>bid-price</code> isn't a valid <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">identifier</a>, so the code is being interpreted as a subtraction:</p>
<pre><code>page_content.bid - price
</code></pre>
<p>When you have an attribute with a name that isn't a valid identifier, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>getattr</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>print(getattr(page_content, "bid-price"))
</code></pre>
</div>
