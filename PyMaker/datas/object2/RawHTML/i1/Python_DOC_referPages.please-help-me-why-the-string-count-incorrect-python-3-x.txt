<p>I have an exercise that find how many time a sub string appear in a main string.</p>
<p>2 inputs are main string and sub string.</p>
<p>I used string.count() but with the main string "abcdcdc" and sub string "cdc", the result only 1 why you can see the sub string "cdc" appeared twice time "ab<strong>cdc</strong>dc" &amp; "abcd<strong>cdc</strong>".</p>
<p>So that I would like to know why my code provided incorrect result.
Does the string.count() on calculate one time for each apperance?
Hereunder is my code:</p>
<pre><code> strs=str(input())
 sub_str=str(input())

print(strs.count(sub_str))
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>count() only counts non-overlapping substrings.</p>

<p>From the documentation here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.count</code></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the number of <strong>non-overlapping</strong> occurrences of substring</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two occurrences in your example overlap. The number of non-overlapping occurrences is one.</p>
