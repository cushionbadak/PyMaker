<p>I wrote my code in the python 3.7 interpreter in pycharm, but I don't know how can I verify it can be interpreted by 3.6x?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Write good tests and run them in 3.6. There is no automated way to confirm some change in the language wasn't introduced in 3.7. You can read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html" rel="noreferrer">the What's New in Python 3.7</a> page to try to make sure you're not using a new in 3.7 feature/behavior that didn't exist in 3.6, but there is no 100% automated solution here; you'll have to write the tests yourself.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try changing your project's interpreter then running your code on different versions.</p>
<p>You'll have to install both 3.6 and 3.7 on your env first, though.<br/>
Then select which interpreter to use from Pycharm.</p>
<p><em>Note: I don't have Python3.6 on my env but it's the same idea.</em>

<blockquote>
<p>In PyCharm you are not limited to using just any single Python
  interpreter. You are able to implement several and in doing so choose
  which interpreter you wish to use for any specific project.</p>
<p>PyCharm supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Python interpreters (see the Supported versions)</li>
<li>Other Python implementations (IronPython, PyPy, Jython, CPython)</li>
<li>Virtualenv Environments: Virtualenv, Pipenv, and Conda.</li>
<li>Remote Python interpreters ( SSH, Vagrant, WSL (only for Windows)).<br/>
<strong>Supported only in PyCharm Professional</strong>.</li>
<li>Docker-based interpreters (Docker, Docker Compose).<br/>
<strong>Supported only in PyCharm Professional</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">can ipython notebook confirm that too?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tsubaki: I have no idea what you mean by that. ipython notebook is just a way of running Python code. It can be installed over different versions of Python. If it's based on 3.6, it will run 3.6 compatible code; base it on 3.7, it'll run 3.7 compatible code.</span>
