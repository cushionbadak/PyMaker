<p>I am trying to install python 3.6.5 from source and link it to openssl. This is my shell script:</p>
<pre><code># new openssl install
curl https://github.com/openssl/openssl/archive/OpenSSL_1_1_1a.zip | tar xz &amp;&amp; cd OpenSSL_1_1_1a &amp;&amp; ./config shared --prefix=/usr/local/ enable-weak-ssl-ciphers &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

# Python install script
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib/"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib/"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include/openssl"
apt-get update
apt-get install build-essential checkinstall -y
apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev -y
cd /home/web/
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/Python-3.6.5.tgz | tar xzf Python-3.6.5.tgz &amp;&amp; cd Python-3.6.5 
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/ 
make install
</code></pre>
<p>When I try to run it from the Downloads using: <code>~/Downloads$ sudo bash custom_python.sh</code> </p>
<p>I get:</p>
<pre><code>tar: Child returned status 2
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now

<p>What is causing it? How to  solve it? 
I can open the python url provided in the wget normally from the browser. </p>

<p>As another user has commented, <code>wget</code> does not write the data to stdout by default. There are two ways to fix your script:</p>
<pre><code>wget -O- https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/Python-3.6.5.tgz | tar xzf Python-3.6.5.tgz &amp;&amp; cd Python-3.6.5
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, you're making Wget output to <code>stdout</code>. However, I generally don't like this method. It is not a good idea to pipe things directly over the network. There are multiple safety and reliability issues. </p>
<p>Instead, you should do this:</p>
<pre><code>wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.5/Python-3.6.5.tgz &amp;&amp; tar xzf Python-3.6.5.tgz &amp;&amp; cd Python-3.6.5
</code></pre>
<p>In the ideal scenario, you also check the signatures / checksums on the file you've downloaded to be sure that you don't have a corrupt archive</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Unlike <code>curl</code>, <code>wget</code> doesn't write the downloaded bytes to stdout by default. I think you want <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and not <code>|</code> between <code>wget</code> and <code>tar</code>?</span>
