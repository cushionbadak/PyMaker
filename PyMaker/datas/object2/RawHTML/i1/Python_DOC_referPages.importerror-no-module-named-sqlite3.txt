<p>The python version on server is 3.5.3 and i have sqlite version 3.13.0 installed
i am currently running code on remote server and i cant use sudo command since its restricted for remote users. is there any thing i can do without sudo command to solve this problem?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you have installed on server, is not a python module, but the <code>sqlite3</code> utility. If you have <code>pip3</code> installed, you can run <code>pip3 install pysqlite3</code> from user, so it will install the module <code>sqlite3</code> in your home directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I Solved this issue by commenting out 
import sqlite3 in the panlex_lite.py file present inside nltk library folder and also commented out sqlite3 connection string present inside this file and the code works now. This solution will only work if you are intented to use nltk only but not sqlite3</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Did the sqlite3 was installed after compiling python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no idea . i recently got the remote access. the resource is placed somewhere else i have no idea how the python was installed. can you describe the exact issue so i can request administrators</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I meet similar problem when I install python from source on machine where there is no headers for sqlite (even when sqlite as tool was installed). After instalin needed package I need to reinstall python (recompile).</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>python3 -m pip install --user -U pysqlite3</code></span>
