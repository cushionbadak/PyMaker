<p>I was ask to post this as a seperate question in another post.
Does a pip install always install with the compiler for the current python version in mind? For example, this <a href="https://jurajtomori.wordpress.com/2018/11/28/nuke-tip-installing-numpy-for-nuke-python-on-windows/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">blog post</a> explained that the module numpy uses c compiled code, which has to be compiled against the same compiler of the python installation.</p>
<p>For example:
<strong>System Python</strong>:
Python 2.7.13 (default, Aug 21 2017, 11:46:40) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32</p>
<p><strong>Nuke Python</strong>:
Python 2.7.13 (default, Aug 21 2017, 11:46:40) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32</p>
<p>v. 1900 -&gt; tells us which compiler was used, numpy and other packages has to be compiled against that identical version</p>

<p>Pip prioritises the version on your PATH. Pip3 and Pip are used to differentiate between the two versions. </p>

<p><code>pip install</code> never installs a compiler. You have to have the compiler before running <code>pip install</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers</a> to learn what version of VC you need to install for different versions of Python.</p>
<p>It would be much simpler to install a precompiled wheel. Said numpy has <a href="https://pypi.org/project/numpy/#files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a lot of precompiled wheels</a>. Currently there are binary wheels for Python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 on MacOS 64 bits, Linux 32 and 64 bits, Windows 32 and 64 bits. Just type <code>pip install numpy</code> and your <code>pip</code> automatically determines what platform it's being ran on and download and install the proper wheel.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Python is not a compiled language. Are you talking about the interpreter?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It depends on how you have installed pip. While installing pip if you have used python2.7 then pip will install packages corresponding to the said version of python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added some sample information.</span>
