<p>I'm using Django and Python 3.7.  I have created a YAML file with seed data for my db ...</p>
<pre><code>./myapp/fixtures/seed_data.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>How do I run this without generating a new migration for it, as is specified here -- <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25960850/loading-initial-data-with-django-1-7-and-data-migrations">Loading initial data with Django 1.7 and data migrations</a> ?  I think theoretically there may be times when I add data to the file and my need to re-run it so it would be a little cumbersome to generate a new migration every time.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Migrations will only run once, as you already correctly noticed :)  </p>
<p>However, you can always manually run a <code>./manage.py loaddata &lt;fixture&gt;</code>. Don't know if that's what you're looking for.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Ah yes that "loaddata" was what I was missing!  Thx</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welcome. But you still might've a problem when you're loading the same data twice. Django doesn't have any "magic" to prevent this (of course).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe its because I have "pk"s in my yaml file, but running this multiple times doens't seem to result in any errors so I think I might be good.</span>
