<p>Hello I am trying to create password reset view in Django. I have set up the mail backend and urls and templates. Everything looks fine but when I try to send mail to reset password Django is sending multiple emails. For example 7 or 11 password reset email at the same time. How can I make it just one email for each time. </p>
<p>Thanks a lot</p>
<p>This is What I did:</p>
<p>setting.py:</p>
<pre><code>EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = "my_email"
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "my_password"
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
</code></pre>
<p>urls.py</p>
<pre><code>path('password-reset/',
     auth_views.PasswordResetView.as_view(template_name='accounts/password_reset.html'),
     name='password_reset'),
path('password-reset/done/',
     auth_views.PasswordResetDoneView.as_view(template_name='accounts/password_reset_done.html'),
     name='password_reset_done'),
path('password-set-confirm/&lt;uidb64&gt;/&lt;token&gt;/',
     auth_views.PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view(template_name='accounts/password_reset_confirm.html'),
     name='password_reset_confirm'),
path('password-set-complete/',
     auth_views.PasswordResetCompleteView.as_view(template_name='accounts/password_reset_complete.html'),
     name='password_reset_complete'),
</code></pre>
<p>Also, I set the templates for each view.</p>

<p>It sometimes helps to check the Django source code itself, so always dive into that if you don't understand what's happening.</p>
<p>If you look at <code>PasswordResetForm</code>'s <code>save()</code> method in <code>django.contrib.auth.forms</code>, you'll see that it loops through <code>self.get_users(email)</code> and then sends one (and only one) email for each <code>user</code>. </p>
<p>So the only way multiple emails can be sent is if there are multiple users with the same <code>email</code>.</p>

<p>I don't think their is any setting for the same you may be end up calling same URL multiple time might be a logic issue.
 Try to use debug mode or with the help of print statements.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to SO. You need to show us a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> so we can understand what you're doing and where things go wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Paste your code in the question using code formatting. Also the settings are probably not relevant here. You need to show the password reset view (and maybe the form) that handles the submission of the password reset form.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did not solve wht but it sending multiple emails to my email for password resetting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I click the reset password it is waiting a while and it is sending many email to target email account. Then it is going to password-reset-done page</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That should not happen. Check in your admin console if there are multiple users with the same email in your backend (that's possible if you didn't specify email to be unique). Or check <code>User.objects.filter(email="theemail@example.com").count()</code> in your console</span>
