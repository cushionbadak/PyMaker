<p>When getting values from a dictionary, I have seen people use two methods:</p>
<p><code>dict.get(key)</code></p>
<p><code>dict.get(key, {})</code></p>
<p>They seem to do the same thing.  What is the difference, and which is the more standard method?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The second parameter to <code>dict.get</code> is optional: it's what's returned if the key isn't found. If you don't supply it, it will return <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'a':1, 'b':2}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.get('c')
None
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.get('c', {})
{}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>get(key[, default])
  Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this method never raises a KeyError.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The typical way to look things up in a dictionary is <code>d[key]</code>, which will raise <code>KeyError</code> when the key is not present.</p>
<p>When you don't want to search for documentation, you can do:</p>
<pre><code>d = {}
help(d.get)
</code></pre>
<p>which will display the docstring for the the <code>get</code> method for dictionary <code>d</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">First method returns None if the key is not present, whereas the second method returns an empty dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Run both on an empty dictionary and you will see.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The latter is usually seen when you want to also call .get on the result again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"They seem to do the same thing" -- how so? 30 seconds of experimentation in the shell falsifies that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note the optional <code>value</code> argument in <code>dict.get()</code>: "Value to be returned if the key is not found. The default value is None." You can also pass in <code>'abcde'</code>, <code>5</code>, or a function call if you so desire</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you @Draconis.  I was using ipython, and it was masking the None returned.  This makes sense.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't know about the help() function.  Thank you @Eric Wilson!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">With <code>ipython</code> the help functionality is built in even nicer -- <code>d.get?</code></span>
