<p>I am aware of how to plot a line graph on top of scatter plot of the same data but is there a way to bring the line graph forward so it sits on top of the markers rather than behind?</p>
<p>Example code:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

x=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])

plt.errorbar(x,y,xerr=0.1,yerr=0.1, fmt="x",markersize=5, color = "orange")
plt.plot(x,y)
</code></pre>
<p>This code outputs a scatter graph with a line graph behind it. When you increase the number of data points it becomes harder to see the line behind them all. Other than decreasing the marker size can I bring the line on top of all the points?</p>

<p>I think you are intending to draw things at different levels of z-order on the screen. This is done like such:</p>
<pre><code>plt.plot(x,y, zorder=10)
</code></pre>
<p>Note 10 is arbitrarily large and this will likely plot on top of your legend too, so you may need to adjust it!</p>

<p>You can use the option <code>barsabove=True</code>. This places the error bars above the markers and the line is displayed on the top of error bars and markers. To highlight this effect, I am using a thick error bar. As you can see, the blue line lies above the error bars and markers. Use <code>barsabove=False</code> (default value) to see the difference.</p>
<pre><code>x=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])
y=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])

plt.errorbar(x,y,xerr=0.1,yerr=0.1, linewidth=10, fmt="x",markersize=5, color = "orange", barsabove=True)
plt.plot(x,y)
</code></pre>
