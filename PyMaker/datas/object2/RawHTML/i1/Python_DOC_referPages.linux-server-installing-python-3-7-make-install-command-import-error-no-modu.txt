<p>I want to install Python 3.7 on my Linux hosting server along with Django. I installed Python by running below command lines:</p>
<pre><code>$ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.2/Python-3.7.2.tgz
$ tar xvzf Python-3.7.2.tgz
$ cd Python-3.7.2
$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
$ make
$ make install
</code></pre>
<p>It is the line 6 where issue came up. After I run <code>make install</code> Here, python successfully installs and then gives an error:</p>
<pre><code>     from _ctypes import Union, Structure, Array
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_ctypes'
make: *** [install] Error 1
</code></pre>
<p>The command <code>make install</code> should have installed pip and setuptools. <strong>But it did not.</strong> But still I moved on to my next step, which was to set environment path that I did with below lines:</p>
<pre><code>$cd $home
$ vi .bash_profile
# Python 3 Adding below line in above file
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
$ source ~/.bash_profile
</code></pre>
<p>I again tried to install pip manually by downloading tgz file from online, extracting it on server and running the program, but it game same error:</p>
<pre><code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_ctypes'
</code></pre>
<p>I went into Lib file of Python installation to see if ctypes module is there or not, and there it was laughing straight at my face!</p>
<p>I have Linux shared server on Godaddy. I went all over internet and found below suggestions but not sure how to go about it:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install libffi (<strong><em>how?</em></strong>), then rebuild Python</p></li>
<li><p>Install yum then libffi, then go about installing pip</p></li>
<li><p>Install python in a different location <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29317734/issue-with-installing-python-in-linux-centos">by providing a prefix</a> during the install.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I am not sure how to work on these suggestions. Please help me resolve this with some step by step suggestion. Please ask for any more information you want.</p>

<p>I just had a talk with my hosting provider. They told me that I can only have custom Python version installed on server if I purchase VPS. They do not give facility to install python in shared hosting provider. Seems this is the answer to my question!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Contacted GoDaddy, Hostgator, and Bluehost. Nobody has Python 3.x on their server. And they do not have option that can allow customers to install newer versions. They have 2.6 only, not even 2.7.</span>
