<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I wrote a Django project which includes some apps. I made a base.html in my users app but I will use of the base.html from my articles app.
I used <code>{% extends 'base.html' %}</code> in general and I tried: </p>
<pre><code>{% extends 'articles:base.html' %} or {% extends 'articles/base.html' %}
</code></pre>
<p>and in myproject/settings.py</p>
<pre><code>TEMPLATES = [
    ...
    'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
    ...
]
</code></pre>
<p>but they did not work.</p>
<p>I would be glad if someone help me. </p>

<p>If your template is located <code>users/templates/base.html</code>, then you would use <code>{% extends 'base.html' %}</code>. However Django's app template loader stops as soon as it finds a match, so will use <code>users/templates/base.html</code> if <code>users</code> is above <code>articles</code> in your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> setting.</p>
<p>For that reason, Django recommends that you create subdirectories inside the app's templates directory. Then save your templates as <code>users/templates/users/base.html</code> and <code>articles/templates/articles/base.html</code>. Now, you can use <code>{% extends 'articles/base.html' %}</code> and <code>{% extends 'users/base.html' %}</code>, and your template names won't clash with each other.</p>
