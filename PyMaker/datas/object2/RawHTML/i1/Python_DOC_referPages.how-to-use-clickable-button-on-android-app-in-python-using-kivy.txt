<p>I'm new here but used to read a lot from this forum so I hope you could help me.</p>
<p>I want to create an app on Android as simple as possible (just for a test and future design) using python, so I choose Kivy to do it for now. This app would just have a button and give the weather of a specific location by pressing a button named on this location.
I succeeded to run it on windows with my cmd but when I open my app using Kivy Launcher on my phone the app crashes before I could do anything. Can someone tell me why ? :o (other examples apps works on my phone with Kivy Launcher)</p>
<p>Here is my code :</p>
<pre><code>import kivy
kivy.require('1.10.1') # replace with your current kivy version !

from kivy.app import App
from kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout
from kivy.uix.button import Button
from kivy.uix.popup import Popup
from kivy.uix.label import Label
import requests

class Main (GridLayout):
    def __init__ (self, **kwargs):
        super (Main, self). __init__(**kwargs)
        self.cols = 2
        self.paris = Button(text='Paris', font_size=40, on_press=lambda a:get_meteo(ville = "Paris"))
        self.add_widget(self.paris)
        self.rio = Button(text='Rio de Janeiro', font_size=40, on_press=lambda a:get_meteo(ville = "Rio de Janeiro, BR"))
        self.add_widget(self.rio)

def get_meteo(ville):   # Obtention de la météo d'une ville.
        print("confirmed")
        meteo = requests.get("http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + ville + ",fr&amp;appid=myID").json()
        print (meteo)

class MeteoApp(App):
    icon = 'icon.png'
    def build(self):
        return Main()

MeteoApp().run()
</code></pre>

<p>Try to use python-for-android tool to build APK and use your application without Kivy launcher. Also, you may try to use Android Debugger Bridge for Linux - adb (eg. for Ubuntu you can install it by <code>sudo apt install adb</code>) to sort out what is the reason of your problem. </p>
<p>The way how you can check it with built APK:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect your device in Developers mode to PC where you made your APK
and where adb is installed. You should do it via usb-cable.</li>
<li>Connect adb to device. More details are here: <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb</a></li>
<li>Remove from your device previous broken version of your APK.</li>
<li>Run command in Terminal: <code>adb install -r yourAppName.apk</code>. You may use your broken version. It should take some time, but you
should get <code>success</code> message in Terminal as a result. This step
mostly is needed to be sure that adb is connected to device
properly.</li>
<li>Run your APK on device. It will crash.</li>
<li>Run command in Terminal on PC: <code>adb logcat | grep python</code> or <code>adb logcat | grep kivy</code>. Or just <code>adb logcat</code> to get full output.</li>
<li>You will get logs from your device and see it in Terminal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps, your problem is closely connected with this: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55130751/kivy-application-does-not-work-on-android/55280549#55280549">Kivy application does not work on Android</a>
and can be solved by installing the freshest version of python-for-android from their github Master branch.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think that kivy launcher uses kivy 1.9.1, so you must change your <code>kivy.require</code> line...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried but that didnt work better... thanks for the try :)</span>
