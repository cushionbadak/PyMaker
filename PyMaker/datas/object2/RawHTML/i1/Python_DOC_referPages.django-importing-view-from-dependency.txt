<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to use <a href="https://github.com/percipient/django-allauth-2fa" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this library</a> since i want to add 2FA Auth to my project. In order to integrate the module in my project, i need to import their views to my <strong>urls.py</strong> file, right?</p>
<p>I tried to import <strong>SetupView</strong>, but i'm getting this error: <code>module 'allauth_2fa.views' has no attribute 'homepage'</code>. Here is what i understood: it looks like if i import a view from the dependency, it will only read those views from the dependency <strong>but not</strong> my own views declared on <strong>views.py</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>from django.urls import path
from . import views
from django.conf.urls import url, include

from django.conf.urls import url

from allauth_2fa import views

app_name = "main"

urlpatterns = [

    path("setup/", views.TwoFactorSetup.as_view(), name="setup"),

    path("", views.homepage, name="homepage"),
    path("register/", views.register, name="register"),
    path("logout/", views.logout_request, name="logout"),
    path("login/", views.login_request, name="login"),

]
</code></pre>
<p>Extra: <strong>SetupView</strong> will generate the page required to enable the 2FA authentication, that's why i need it. Later i will also import the other views required to have my two factor authentication fully running</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>At first you imported</p>
<pre><code>from . import views
</code></pre>
<p>And then:</p>
<pre><code>from allauth_2fa import views
</code></pre>
<p>And after that you tried to do:</p>
<pre><code>path("", views.homepage, name="homepage"),
</code></pre>
<p>And views is allauth_2fa.views not from your project</p>
<p>So you just need to do like this:</p>
<pre><code>from allauth_2fa import views as allauth_2fa_views
</code></pre>
<p>And then use it when you need</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer! I tried to change my import to the last line added, but i got this error again: module 'main.views' has no attribute 'TwoFactorSetup'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">TwoFactorSetup is from your project?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if no just use allauth_2fa_views.TwoFactorSetup instead of views.TwoFactorSetup</span>
<span class="comment-copy">TwoFactorSetup is the view i'm trying to import from the allauth_2fa module</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should use views when you want to use views from your project and use allauth_2fa_views when you want views from allauth_2fa</span>
