<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>My question is similar to this one: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19377969/combine-two-columns-of-text-in-dataframe-in-pandas-python">Combine two columns of text in dataframe in pandas/python</a> </p>
<p>However, I want to combine multiple columns, some of which are text and some are non-text. Moreover, I would like to do it in a loop, row by row because I need to preprocess the resulting text</p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<pre><code> for i in range(len(df)):
      text = df.loc[i, text_cols].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(str(x)))
</code></pre>
<p><code>text_cols</code> is a parameter.</p>
<p>But it seems the result is not a text but an array of chars...</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>:
It seems the following solution works:</p>
<pre><code>  text = ''
  for col in text_cols:
    text += ' ' + str(df.loc[i,col])
</code></pre>
<p>I wonder if there is a more fancy solution for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>iterrows:</code></p>
<pre><code>for index, row in df.iterrows():
    "Pre-process your data here"
    "To process particular row you can do this"
    row["column_name to process"]


</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you show some sample data? I have posted a answer where you can iterate row by row and do the pre processing. But I will need to have a look at your df to help you. Please post df.head() here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the labels of columns is a parameter <code>text_cols</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added an update to my question, your solution is too general</span>
