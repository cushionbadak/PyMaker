<p>CentOS 7 already has Python2.7.5 stock installed. I am doing an online course that requires Python3.x installed. So these are the following steps i took to install Python3.7.3.rc1 :</p>
<pre><code>$cd /usr/src
$sudo wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/Python-3.7.3rc1.tgz
$sudo tar xzf Python-3.7.3rc1.tgz
$cd Python-3.7.3rc1
$sudo ./configure --enable-optimizations
$sudo make altinstall
$sudo rm /usr/src/Python-3.7.3rc1.tgz
$python3.7 --version
Python 3.7.3rc1
</code></pre>
<p>I followed these steps religiously from this link : <a href="https://tecadmin.net/install-python-3-7-on-centos/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://tecadmin.net/install-python-3-7-on-centos/</a></p>
<p>During my course i was required to install pyperclip using pip.
So i did :</p>
<pre><code>$python3.7 -m pip install pyperclip
/usr/local/bin/python3.7: No module named pip
</code></pre>
<p>Please suggest a method to install pip for Python3.7.3rc1.</p>

<p>You should have taken the default available python3, that is the python3.6 package in centos7
that would have been easier to setup rather than compile an unsupported version.
Suggest you install the supported python3 package in centos</p>
<p><strong>Try doing yum install python36 from repository</strong></p>
<pre><code>sudo yum install -y https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update yum package</strong></p>
<pre><code> sudo yum update
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Install python36 along with pip</strong></p>
<pre><code>sudo yum install -y python36u python36u-libs python36u-devel python36u-pip
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Below steps are for python3.7</strong>, 
suggest avoiding unsupported packages.
Alternate Steps for pip setup for Centos
You need to install pip for python3.7 series 
Step 1: First install the EPEL Repository</p>
<pre><code>sudo yum install epel-release
</code></pre>
<p>Step 2: Installing pip </p>
<pre><code>python37 -m pip
</code></pre>
<p>Step 3: Verify if pip was installed properly
pip --version</p>
<p>If the command not found error shows up, try</p>
<pre><code>python37 -m ensurepip
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried running the <code>pip</code> command directly, without <code>python</code> before it? Like: <code>pip install pyperclip</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, but the problem is that running pip directly uses Python2.7.5. So importing pyperclip in Python3.7.3rc1 gives error <code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyperclip'</code> but works fine for Python2.7.5.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see. How about running <code>pip3</code>? Does it show something to you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, <code>bash: pip3: command not found...</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Think you've done a lot of work for a beginner unnecessarily. Try installing the python36 package that's the default supported python3.x series in centos 7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think that the Step 2 installs pip but instead calls out pip. Nevertheless i did   it and it gives the same error <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.7: No module named pip </code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Avoid python3.7 and go for python3.6 that comes with centos7. You are doing the task which tends to be difficult even for experienced programmers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. Installing Python3.6 worked liked a charm with pip.</span>
