<p>So I have this code and immediately after the code is completed I want to clear the screen and run another code automatically, please how do I do this?</p>
<pre><code>def load():
    n("Loading")
    for load in range(1,4):
        n(".")
        time.sleep(1)


load()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To clear the output of the script use following on Windows:</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.system('cls')
</code></pre>
<p>Or this for Linux/MacOS</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.system('clear')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Take a look at this: <a href="http://introtopython.org/terminal_apps.html#Clearing-the-screen" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Introduction to python</a></p>
<pre><code>import os

# Show a simple message.
print("I like climbing mountains.")

# Clear the screen.
os.system('clear')
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, you will see no "I like climbing mountains." because as soon as the message is displayed the terminal will be cleared.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The command to clear the terminal screen is different on Windows. The command <code>os.system('cls')</code> should work.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Something like this will work</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.system('cls')
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">all the stuff there doesn't work all it does is print 100 new lines or doesn't work at all, does it work in python 3.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Curris How about you then write a better question where you explain that you are working with python 3.7 and want the clear the idle window instead of the screen?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>for x in range(1, 4):         n('.')         time.sleep(1)     print('\n' * 100)</code> just moves down 100 line or you can change how many you want (tested in python3.7)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that code is only working in command prompt not in python-idle</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i am using python shell and it doesn't work i do not know y</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide the screenshot?</span>
