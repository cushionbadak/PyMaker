<p>I have the bellow list of tuples in python:</p>
<pre><code>[(('A', 'B'), 4), (('B', 'C'), 4), (('C', 'D'), 4)]
</code></pre>
<p>And I want to extract the Information as shown bellow:</p>
<pre><code>[('A', 'B', 4), ('B', 'C', 4), ('C', 'D', 4)]
</code></pre>
<p>How can I bring it to this form by extracting the inner tuple?</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://codeyarns.com/2012/04/26/unpack-operator-in-python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">unpack operator</a> (prefix <code>*</code>) to spread out an iterable:</p>
<pre><code>tuples = [(('A', 'B'), 4), (('B', 'C'), 4), (('C', 'D'), 4)]
result = [(*t[0], t[1]) for t in tuples]
result # [('A', 'B', 4), ('B', 'C', 4), ('C', 'D', 4)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">General comment - add some text, so it looks more like an answer. In particular naming the unpacking operator may be useful for future readers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kabanus rather than trying to answer as quickly as possible to increase your rep, you both could be looking for an appropriate duplicate, which almost certainly exists ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Chris_Rands I don't see how think quick answers would be a problem, specially if they do solve the problem.</span>
