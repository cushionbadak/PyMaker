<p>Before I've installed python 3.6 and update all (conda update --all) my Jupyter Notebook just stopped to works. When I launch it, just an empty browser page appears. I tried all solutions that I found, but they don't work. I have deleted %USERBLABLA%, clear cache and cookies, uninstall and install it again and it still doesn't work. Browser console prints this errors:</p>
<pre><code>Refused to execute script from '&lt;URL&gt;' because its MIME type ('text/plain') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled

Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined

<p>You should check the version of Notebook on Anaconda Navigator. 
If it's 5.7.6 then you should downgrade the notebook's version to 5.7.4 by using the Anaconda Navigator.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thiscan  often be fixed by a deep reload in the browser (Ctrl+F5 on most systems).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nope, I've already tried</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried a different browser? Or a reboot :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. Even uninatall and install again, but when I update all, its just stop working.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks you man, you really helped! I just did everything that I found and only your tip worked. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@demo Jupyter lab won't work as well with 5.7.6. 5.7.4 is ok with JupyterLab 0.35.2 or 0.35.3</span>
