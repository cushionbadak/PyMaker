<p>I am a Chinese programmer with poor English. I have a problem. </p>
<p>I'm a novice. How can I get the output in Python 2 in Python 3 environment? I want to know the difference between their opening binary files. I hope to get a reply. Thank you.</p>

<p>Following is happening here: </p>
<p>Python 2 doesn't have a type to represent raw bytes. Instead, these bytes are represented by a string, and when printing, it tries to output the bytes as characters. If a character isn't ASCII though, it results in weird characters with question-mark icons etc.</p>
<p>In Python 3, a bytes type was introduced. Opening a file as binary in Python 3 will return a bytes type. When printing the bytes type, all bytes that can't be represented by ASCII properly are escaped as something between <code>\x00</code> and <code>\xFF</code> (hexadecimal).</p>
<p>So the difference is that Python 3 has the capability to store and print raw bytes, while Python 2 doesn't.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't think there's much difference. But printing a binary file doesn't generally make sense.</span>
