<p>I have Gui with Pyqt5.  I have a few QLineEdit in my Gui, and when you click the button it submits the value of those variables. It's working fine. I also have a function which clears all the LineEdits. It's working fine too. </p>
<p>But I want that when I press Submit the variables get submitted and then cleared. Can I run a function in another function without writing it new (because then I would have to change both everytime). </p>
<p>My button is like this: </p>
<pre><code>submitButton = QPushButton("Text", self) 
submitButton.triggered.connect(self.submit)
</code></pre>
<p>To achieve this can I just do it like that? </p>
<pre><code>submitButton = QPushButton("Text", self) 
submitButton.triggered.connect(self.submit, self.clear)
</code></pre>
<p>PS: If there is a typo in my code don't worry cause my code in general is fine. I just wrote it down on my phone. </p>

<p>You can connect it like this :</p>
<pre><code>submitButton = QPushButton("Text", self) 
submitButton.clicked.connect(self.submit)
submitButton.clicked.connect(self.clear)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I would, instead of making one button call 2 methods make this button call 1 method that does 2 things.</p>
<pre><code>   def do_thing(button):
      button.submit()
      button.clear()

   submitButton = QPushButton("Text", self) 
   submitButton.triggered.connect(do_thing(self))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I couldn't understand why you don't create a new function to include the two functions. What it "because then I would have to change both everytime" means  ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you don't gat an error : AttributeError: 'QPushButton' object has no attribute 'triggered'?</span>
