<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i have a folder of gray-scale images from 0 to 9 and they are around 2400, i need to load them in python so as to have all Zeors together as an array , then Ones together as an array, etc...
i used below code to load one image as an array but i don`t know how to load all images and group each number together.
i thought about iteration through the folder.</p>
<p>Do anyone know how to do it or is there any other idea?</p>
<pre><code>import imageio

im = imageio.imread('Train/1.jpg')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do it in the following manner:</p>
<pre><code>import imageio
for i in range(9):
    im = imageio.imread('Train/'+str(i)+'.jpg')
</code></pre>
<p>You can also create a 3D variable whose third dimension is equal to the number of files to read the complete data in a single 3D array.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Please provide more information on your folder structure. Are all images in one folder containing only images?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes except one txt file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And how do the files zero, one, zwo etc. differ from each other? How can we determine in which group a given file belongs?</span>
