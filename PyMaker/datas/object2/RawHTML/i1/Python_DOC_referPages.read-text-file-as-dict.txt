<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>b</code> and <code>d</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have answered this, please check. I have placed data into a dictionary and also created a string text as you have mentioned (which is not actually a <code>dict</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. That's simple and easy.  I was struggling with converting the values to a list. so list(map) does that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. But this prints the values with comma separated which is not my desired  output</span>
