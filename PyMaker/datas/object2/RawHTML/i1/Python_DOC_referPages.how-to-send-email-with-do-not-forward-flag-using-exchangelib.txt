<p>In short, it's really tricky to do if you are not using a Microsoft-supplied library. You have to build a binary message with all sorts of magic variables and send that as a custom extended property. <em>Plus</em> you have to implement the client-side encryption needed by EWS rights management.</p>
<p>AFAIK, no-one has attempted a Python solution yet, and probably no-one here is going to provide you with a full solution due to the amount of work involved.</p>
