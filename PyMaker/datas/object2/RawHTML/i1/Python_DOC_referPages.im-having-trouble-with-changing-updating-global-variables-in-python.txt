<p>So I was having trouble understanding the basics of global variable as I am a beginner in python. I wanted to try to change a global variable but unfortunate it didn't work. Could any of you explain and help my fix my problem. Thanks!!</p>
<pre><code>global x
x = 10
def NEWX():
     print (x)
     x = x + 5
     print (x)
print (x)
NEWX()
print(x)

#this displays 10 10 15 10
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this refactor:</p>
<pre><code>x = 10


def new_x():
    global x
    print(x)
    x = x + 5
    print (x)


print(x)
new_x()
print(x)

# prints 10 10 15 15
</code></pre>
<p>I was unable to run your original code, it complained about <code>x</code> being undefined in the function. Within the scope of the function, <code>x</code> is unknown. It's known at the higher scope, but not in your function. That's why the <code>global x</code> statement needs to be in the function - to let python know to use the <code>x</code> from the outer scope.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>x = 10

def NEWX():
     global x
     print (x)
     x = x + 5
     print (x)

print (x)
NEWX()
print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Global variable rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>global</em> keyword outside a function has no effect</li>
<li>Variable outside a function is global by default</li>
<li><em>global</em> keyword is needed to read and write global variable within a function</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your code, you are first printing the value of x. The function <code>NEWX():</code> is then called which prints x, then adds 5 onto x and prints the new value. After the function is called, x is printed again. </p>
<p>To understand what is happening, check out this example that contains the fix:</p>
<pre><code> x = 10

def NEWX():
    print (x)
    global x
    x = x + 5
    print (x)
print (x)
NEWX()
print(x)
</code></pre>
