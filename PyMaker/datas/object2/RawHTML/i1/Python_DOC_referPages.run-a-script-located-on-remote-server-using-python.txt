<p>I have a python script located on a remote server with SSH enabled. That script displays a lot of debug messages displayed while executing. I want to trigger this script using another python script which is on my local system and depending on the  output of the earlier script, I want to proceed further. While doing all this, I want the display messages on the remote server to be displayed on my local system as well. Basically, I want to view whatever output is thrown by the remote script during the course of the script, on my local system. I am able to trigger the script using paramiko but I am neither able to check whether the script on the remote server is running nor am I able to view it's output. Is there any way to do it? Already tried conn.recv(65535) but to no avail.</p>

<p>In my experience I found python fabric module easier than using paramiko. If you want to execute local script on remote machine using fabric. You just need to upload them using <code>put()</code> and then call <code>run()</code> api. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why make this more complicated than it should be? Stat the terminal on the client, ssh into the server, stat the script and redirect both its stdout and stderr to a file. In the separate tab/window of your terminal follow the progress of the script using <code>tail -f /path/to/the/file</code>. You want to avoid shelling out from Python whenever possible. You can auto-schedule tasks with a cron job. You should have enough of the access to the server or else it is not very useful. What are your constraints?</span>
