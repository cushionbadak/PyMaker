<p>I wrote a python code where it will take user input and convert it into uppercase to match my positive list and negative list. but it is not considering the negative list properly. I must be wrong on giving a conditional statement it seems. I tried two codes but not working. also, I tried to sum up how many positive feedbacks and negative feedbacks using <code>len(words)</code> but no working at all.</p>
<pre><code> - **code1:**

keyword_list = ['GOOD', 'ADMIRE', 'SUPER', 'BEST', "INCREDIBLE", 'NOT BAD', 'NOT SO BAD', 'KEEP IT UP']
print("Enter your feedback")
user_review = input().upper()
if set(keyword_list).intersection(user_review.split()):
  print ("POSTIVE FEEDBACK")
else:
  print("NEGATIVE FEEDBACK")


- **code2:**

negative_words = ['BAD', 'TERRIBLE','NOT GOOD']
positive_words = ['GOOD', 'ADMIRE', 'SUPER', 'BEST', "INCREDIBLE"]
print("Enter your honest review")
user_review = input().upper()
for review in user_review:
    # split the tweet into words:
    words = review.split()

if set(positive_words).intersection(user_review.split()):
  print ("POSTIVE REVIEW")
elif set(negative_words).intersection(user_review.split()):
  print ("NEGATIVE REVIEW")
else:
  print("MODERATE REVIEW")
</code></pre>

<p>Have you tried to debug this?</p>
<pre><code>set(keyword_list).intersection(['NOT', 'BAD'])
</code></pre>
<p>This is the results of your</p>
<pre><code>set(keyword_list).intersection(user_review.split())
</code></pre>
<p>with <code>NOT BAD</code> as input.</p>
<p>This returns a set with an empty list inside: <code>set([])</code></p>
<p>That's because 'NOT' and 'BAD' are not elements of the set. <code>NOT BAD</code> is. If you split the two word elements it won't work.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can achieve your objective in this way</p>
<pre><code>negative_words = ['BAD', 'TERRIBLE','NOT GOOD']
positive_words = ['GOOD', 'ADMIRE', 'SUPER', 'BEST', "INCREDIBLE"]
user_review = input("Enter your honest review").upper()
if user_review in positive_words:
    print("POSITIVE REVIEW")
elif user_review in negative_words:
    print("NEGATIVE REVIEW")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean when you say that  it isn't considering negative reviews properly? What are you expecting?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@davidlowryduda I mean when I'm trying to give user input as a negative word which is in the list, still it is giving as positive feedback</span>
