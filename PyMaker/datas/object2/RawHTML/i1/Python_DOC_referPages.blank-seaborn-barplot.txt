<p>I am trying to plot a barplot of a pandas df in seaborn however it always appears as white bars which don't show up on white background. Setting to style=darkgrid means I can see them but I want them to be much more prominent and for some reason colour seems to have no effect. Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<pre><code>sns.set(style="darkgrid")
sns.barplot(x="index", y="Frequency", data=explore, orient="v")
</code></pre>

<p>If colour is the issue means, not able to see properly then you can also use the palette property of seaborn to choose different colour palette other than the default one.</p>
