<p>According to my research, the csvreader reads in data that is in a format like this</p>
<pre><code>Name,Date,Job
John,3/14/2019,Doctor
Susan,3/14/2019,Cashier
</code></pre>
<p>However, the data that I have stored is formatted like this</p>
<pre><code>Name,John,Susan,
Date,3/14/2019,3/14/2019
Job,Doctor,Cashier
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a way to get the CSV reader to read it in this way? I am currently doing it without it but its quite tedious when new lines show up between the commas.</p>

<p>I know you are trying to use the csv library, but this is easy with pandas and the transpose operation.</p>
<p>import pandas as pd</p>
<p>df = pd.read_csv('horizontal.csv', index_col=0)</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; df
           John      Susan
Name                      
Date  3/14/2019  3/14/2019
Job      Doctor    Cashier

&gt;&gt;&gt; df.T
Name        Date      Job
John   3/14/2019   Doctor
Susan  3/14/2019  Cashier

<span class="comment-copy">Why dont you store it as a normal csv?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@balderman It's not my data it's the way my company stored it in an excel doc and then when you convert it to a csv file for easy reading it is saved like that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you trying to transpose? Somthing like <code>list(zip(*reader))</code> will work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">csv is easy too: <code>list(zip(*reader))</code></span>
