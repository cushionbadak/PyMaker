<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is my first post on StackOverflow, so if I do anything wrong, please let me know. This game, called Cows and Bulls, is similar to a game called Mastermind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows</a>. Essentially, you have to guess the four digit code without giving any duplicate numbers. The error that I am having is that when I get to the section named "Check code for repeated numbers", if there are duplicates in the randomized code, it will enter an infinite loop at the while statement. Would anyone be able to help me with this?</p>
<pre><code>import random
def main():
    bulls=0 #Correct Number in Correct Position

    repeatedCode=True

    #Check for exactly four digits
    if GUESS &lt;= 1000 or GUESS &gt;= 9999:
        print("Invalid input - Guess must be four digits!")
