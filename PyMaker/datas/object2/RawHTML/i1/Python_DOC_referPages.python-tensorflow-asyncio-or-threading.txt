<p>I am implementing a server for recognizing objects in photos using tensorflow-gpu in "semi-real" time.  It will listen for new photos on a websocket connection, then enqueue it into a list for the detector run when it is free.  Would it be simpler to use asyncio or threading to handle the websocket listener and the recognition queue?</p>

<p>I am not an expert in threading/asyncio but maybe it would be easier to spawn an instance of Kafka and have a piece of code that would listen to a Kafka topic? To this topic you would push images or paths to images if you already store them locally. Moreover, using <code>consumer-groups</code> you would get a load balancing like thing for free as it is a part of Kafka.</p>
