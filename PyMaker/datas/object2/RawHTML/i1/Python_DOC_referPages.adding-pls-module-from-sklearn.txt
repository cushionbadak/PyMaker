<p>I have a little probleme with the sklearn library.
I am trying to import a module named 'pls' and I have en error </p>
<pre><code>ImportError: cannot import name 'pls'
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to do like this post: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10729116/adding-a-module-specifically-pymorph-to-spyder-python-ide">adding-a-module-specifically</a>
but I have no 'pls' file in my 'sklearn' file.</p>
<p>Even after upgraded my sklearn version with <code>pip install -U scikit-learn</code>...
It says it is already up-to-date.</p>
<p>Any idea ? 
Thanks for your help, and pardon my english :P</p>

<p>Python cannot magically know that the <code>pls</code> module you want is inside <code>sklearn</code>. You need to specify it. Also the sklearn version 0.11 is many years old, things have moved since then. With scikt-learn 0.20, the right way is:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>from sklearn.cross_decomposition import PLSRegression

estimator = PLSRegression()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you add the exact import statement you are trying to use to your question (not as a comment though). I also cannot find any reference that a <code>pls</code> module exists in <code>scikit-learn</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is exactly the module you are trying to get?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try installing scipy and numpy ??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Scipy and Numpy already installed and both up-to-date. I want to get this module : <a href="http://ogrisel.github.io/scikit-learn.org/sklearn-tutorial/modules/generated/sklearn.pls.PLSRegression.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sklearn.pls</a></span>
