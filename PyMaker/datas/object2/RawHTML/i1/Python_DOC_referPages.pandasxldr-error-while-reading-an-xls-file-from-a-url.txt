<p>There are 2 possible reasons for this:</p>
<p>1).The file that you've getting from the source url is not as the
   same file format as the file extension says</p>
<p>2).XLS files are encrypted if you explicitly apply a workbook
    password but also if you password protect some of the worksheet
    elements. As such it is possible to have an encrypted XLS file even
    if you don't need a password to open it.</p>
<p>if you have the problem number one the you have a solution open the workbook and save it as the supported format.</p>
<pre><code>file1 = io.open(filename, "r", encoding="utf-8")
data = file1.readlines()
# Creating a workbook object
xldoc = Workbook()
# Adding a sheet to the workbook object
sheet = xldoc.add_sheet("Sheet1", cell_overwrite_ok=True)
# Iterating and saving the data to sheet
for i, row in enumerate(data):
    # Two things are done here
    # Removeing the '\n' which comes while reading the file using io.open
    # Getting the values after splitting using '\t'
    for j, val in enumerate(row.replace('\n', '').split('\t')):
        sheet.write(i, j, val)

# Saving the file as an excel file
xldoc.save('myexcel.xls')
</code></pre>
<p>the file you've downloaded it would be html also.use below code snippet to verify for a one file.</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
df_list = pd.read_html('filename.xlsx')
df = pd.DataFrame(df_list[0])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">can you show the code that you have written to take from the url?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well the code is complicated i am using pandas.read_excel(link)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you open it from a excel viewer the notebook is downloaded as you wished?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i even tried it by downloading a local file but still its giving error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry for the confusion i mean have you open that file from a excel viewer like MS Excel or Open Office? its probably password encrypted</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks man i tried the second one but excel file contains multiple sheets and i am not able to track them</span>
<span class="comment-copy">test for one excel file and see i think you are downloading different formatted file. use the second method and verify.</span>
