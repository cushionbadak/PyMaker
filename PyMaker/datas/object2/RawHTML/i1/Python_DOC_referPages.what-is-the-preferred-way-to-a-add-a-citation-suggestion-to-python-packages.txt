<p>How should developers indicate how users should cite the package, other than on the documentation?</p>
<p>R packages return the preferred citation using <code>citation("pkg")</code>.</p>
<p>I can think of <code>pkg.CITATION</code>, <code>pkg.citation</code> and <code>pkg.__citation__</code>.  Are there others?  If there is no preferred way (which seems to be the case to me as I did not find anything on python.org), what are the pros and cons of each?</p>

<p>Finally I opted for the dunder option.  Only the dunder option (<code>__citation__</code>) makes clear, that this is not a normal variable needed for runtime.</p>
<p>Yes, dunder strings should not be used inflationary because python might use them at a later time.  But if python is going to use <code>__citation__</code>, then it will be for a similar purpose.  Also, I deem the relative costs higher with the other options.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I am not aware of this in Python. I mean there is <code>__name__</code> and <code>__doc__</code> but they are not for that kind of R citation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, in the end it's probably a question of convention.</span>
