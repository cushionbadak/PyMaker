<p>When this function is run I get an unsupported operand error. I have tried putting <code>str()</code> and <code>int()</code> in but it gives other errors such as "not all arguments converted during string formatting".</p>
<p>The full error code is:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>In line 124, you should convert into <code>int</code> to make a subtraction. Then change into <code>str</code> to print:</p>
<pre><code>if Final2 &gt; Final1:
    print("Player 2 won round 1 by " + str(int(Final2) - int(Final1)) + " points")
elif Final1 &gt; Final2:
    print("Player 1 won round 1 by " + str(int(Final1) - int(Final2)) + " points")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>Final1</code> and <code>Final2</code> are both <code>str</code> values, not numbers. You can't subtract strings. Also, <code>Dice == "N" or "n"</code> isn't doing what you think it is.</span>
