<p>I want to run the exe file with command line arguments in Mac terminal</p>
<pre><code>p1.exe -f input.txt
</code></pre>
<p>But im getting error -bash: p1: command not found</p>
<p>I have converted python file p1.py into p1.exe using</p>
<pre><code>pyintsaller p1.py --onefile
</code></pre>
<p>And running the python file with arguments works</p>
<pre><code>python p1.py -f input.txt
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This isn't to do with Python, but is a basic command shell issue. To run an executable from the current directory, you need to use the  <code>./</code> prefix.</p>
<pre><code>./p1.exe -f input.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Note, it's a bit odd to use a .exe extension for a Linux executable.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Note that on Unix like systems (Linux/Unix/Solaris/MacOS). scripts can be run without explicitly invoking interpreter, if two conditions are meet:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>script file starts with this line (or similar): <code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code></p></li>
<li><p>file has executable attribute flag is set</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then you can run script like this:</p>
<pre><code>./p1.py --onefile
</code></pre>
<p><code>./</code> means run thing from local directory. If this is not pressent the it tries to run things located by <code>PATH</code> variable, that is why you can run interpreter <code>python</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">If that <code>.exe</code> is a Windows PE executable, it won't execute on macOS. No Windows executable will (unless you're using an emulation or virtualization layer). You'll need to package into a macOS <code>.app</code> package or build a macOS installer instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its a linux executable</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "Linux executable"? Do you mean an ELF file? I don't think macOS can execute an ELF executable natively either. The native executable file format for modern macOS systems is Mach-O.</span>
