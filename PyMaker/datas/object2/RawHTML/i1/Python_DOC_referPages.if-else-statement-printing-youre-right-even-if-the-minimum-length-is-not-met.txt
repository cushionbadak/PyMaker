<p>I just started python and I'm having some trouble using the if else statement in python. I'm trying to create a program that checks the length of a password. If it matches the minimum length it should print a message saying you're correct, but when it doesn't it should print you're not correct. When I run my code, it only prints out "you're correct" even though the min length is not met. I'm not sure if I have used the if else statement correctly, do I need to use 2 variables to make it work?</p>
<pre><code>MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH = 6 #The length of the password is determined by the variable MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH.
                    #We have assigned the variable with the value of 6.

password = input('Enter your password: ')
password_length = len(password)

if MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH &gt;= 6:
    print("Your password is correct!")
else:
    print("Your not correct!")

print('Number of characters used in password: ', password_length,'and the min length expected is: ',MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You are comparing your constant variable, you should use:</p>
<pre><code>if password_length &gt;= MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH:
    ...
    ...
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The if statement should be</p>
<pre><code>if password_length &gt;= MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH:
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rR9UK.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/rR9UK.png"/></a> The problem was in your if condition. It seems you meant to check if <code>password_lenth</code> was equal or greater than <code>MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH</code> , instead you were checking if <code>MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH &gt;= 6</code> which is checking if MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH was greater than 6. </p>
<p>You can fix it by replacing <code>if MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH &gt;= 6:</code> with this line:</p>
<pre><code>if password_length &gt;= MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH:
</code></pre>
<p>Hope its the solution you were looking for.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you're using <code>MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH</code> not  <code>password_length</code> in your if statement, so it will always test <code>6 &gt;= 6</code>. You meant to do <code>if password_length &gt;= MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH</code></span>
