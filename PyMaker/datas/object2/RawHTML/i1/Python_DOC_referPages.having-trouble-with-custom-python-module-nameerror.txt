<p>I have been using Python for scripting for a while. By one of my larger projects required that I break down my code into modules. I will describe the scenario below.</p>
<p>Currently, I have two modules. Module A and Module B. </p>
<p>Module A is a class which is used to store data about an objects attributes. It also consists of a number of useful functions which help with parsing the data.</p>
<p>Module B is a very simple helper class with a number of parsing functions which are user-defined.</p>
<p>The way things are set up now, the user has to import Module A and B separately and create a list of all the function objects in Module B. This list of functions is added to Module A by passing it as an attribute to the method <strong>A.add_parser()</strong>. This method sets the functions from B as attributes of A using the function name.</p>
<p>Now, all of this works great and I have tested it. The problem is that one of the parsing functions call for the use of the RegEx module <strong>re</strong>. I am getting a </p>
<pre><code>NameError: name 're' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>I separately imported the <strong>re</strong> module and am still getting this error. I am familiar with the  <strong>LEGB</strong> rule and since <strong>re</strong> is present in the <em>global</em> scope, I do not understand why I am getting this error.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated. Thank you!</p>

<p>only need to import the library, before the usage</p>
<p>import re</p>
<p>m = re.search('(?&lt;=abc)def', 'abcdef')</p>
<p>m.group(0)</p>
<p>'def'</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Global is module-global. Did you <code>import re</code> in the module that needs it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This fixed it. Thank you!</span>
