<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to Count "D" (groupby "B" and "C"). And I want as an Output:
If my count is between 4 and 15: True
If my count is not between 4 and 15: False 
But my Code does not work:
df[df['A'] == True].groupby(['B', 'C'])[['D']].count() &gt; 4 &amp; &lt; 15</p>
<p>Can you help me?
Thank you!</p>

<p>I believe you need <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.between.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Series.between</code></a> with <code>inclusive</code> parameter:</p>
<pre><code>s = df[df['A'] == True].groupby(['B', 'C'])['D'].count()

out = s.between(4, 15, inclusive=False)
print (out)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@PythonBeast007 - there is change in my code <code>[['D']]</code> to <code>['D']</code> for return <code>Series</code></span>
