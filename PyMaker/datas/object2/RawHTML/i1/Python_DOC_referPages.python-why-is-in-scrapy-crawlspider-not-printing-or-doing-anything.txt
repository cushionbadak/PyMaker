<p>I'm new to scrapy and cant get it to do anything. Eventually I want to scrape all the html comments from a website by following internal links.</p>
<p>For now I'm just trying to scrape the internal links and add them to a list.</p>
<pre><code>import scrapy
from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider, Rule
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor

    class comment_spider(CrawlSpider):
        name = 'test'
        allowed_domains = ['https://www.andnowuknow.com/']
        start_urls = ["https://www.andnowuknow.com/"]

        rules = (Rule(LinkExtractor(), callback='parse_start_url', follow=True),)

        def parse_start_url(self, response):
            return self.parse_item(response)

        def parse_item(self, response):
            urls = []
            for link in LinkExtractor(allow=(),).extract_links(response):
                urls.append(link)
                print(urls)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm just trying get it to print something at this point, nothing I've tried so far works.</p>
<p>It finishes with an exit code of 0, but won't print so I cant tell whats happening.</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Surely your messages log should give us some hints, but I see your <code>allowed_domains</code> has a URL instead of a domain. You should set it like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>allowed_domains = ["andnowuknow.com"]
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.spiders.Spider.allowed_domains" rel="nofollow noreferrer">(See it in the official documentation)</a></p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is this all your code? Because it seems incomplete. There is a class defined, but do you create an instance of this class?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you required to use scrapy? There is plenty of Q&amp;A about beautifulsoup that also allow access to web page contents...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is my first time using a class, what would be the best way to create an instance?</span>
