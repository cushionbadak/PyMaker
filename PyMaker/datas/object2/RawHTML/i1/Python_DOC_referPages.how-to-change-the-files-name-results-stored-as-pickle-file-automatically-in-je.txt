<p>I'm using python 2.7 and Jenkins latest version.</p>
<p>When Jenkins is triggered, results from python script is stored in pickle files for the future use.</p>
<p>Whenever a build happens, I want to store every build results of a python script in pickle files. I'm able to store the results in pickle files.
How can I save every build's results with different file names so that I can access the files from the python script.</p>
<p>Is it possible to add build_number and job_name as a file name 
or appending/prepending build_number to current file name ?</p>
<p>Later with another python script I should be able to access the current and previous successful build (last 2 successful builds) pickle files to compare the results.</p>
<p>For the solution, Changes in Jenkinsfile or python script or both are welcome.
Thanks.</p>

<p>From a python script you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.rename" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.rename()</code></a> to rename your file. Jenkins sets environment variables for a running job to give you the job name and number. </p>
<p>Combinig the two you can do:</p>
<pre><code>job_name = os.environ.get('JOB_NAME', 'default_name')
build_number = os.environ.get('BUILD_NUMBER', 1)
new_output = "{}_{}.bin".format(job_name, build_number)
os.rename(original_output, new_output)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @handras, As I'm new here, can you please elaborate ? If possible with an example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My answer already has an example, which is a Python code. Have tried runnig it? What part gave you error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey, @handras, result I wanted is.. job_name and build_number should be appended to pickle file that is generated from the script. Later with another python script I should be able to access the current and previous successful build (last 2 successful builds) pickle files to compare the results. Please help with this.</span>
