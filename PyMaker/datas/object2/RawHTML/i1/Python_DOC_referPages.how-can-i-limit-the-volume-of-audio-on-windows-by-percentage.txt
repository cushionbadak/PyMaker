<p>I tried working with decibels but for some reason I can't manage to control it. I understood that decibels are logaritmic and I have no idea how am I supposed to increase/decrease the volume of a process by 1%.</p>
<p>I use <code>pycaw</code> in order to control the audio, yet I noticed that there is no way to change the volume percentage of the <code>IAudioEndpointVolume</code> class. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Is there anyway to change the audio output level of the end point by percentage? Is there any way to convert decibels to percents?</p>

<p>Problem solved with <a href="https://github.com/Paradoxis/Windows-Sound-Manager" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> amazing <code>Windows-Sound-Manager</code> project by Paradoxis.</p>
<p>Note: It's possible to combine this solution with the <code>pycaw</code> library, in order to change the processes` volume level when the endpoint (speaker device) reaches 100%.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><i>"Is there any way to convert decibels to percents?"</i> Yes. But do you want 1% of power, 1% of dB value, 1% of voltage or 1% of something else? Are you sure you know what exactly you want?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Also, what is this question really about? How to set volume in Windows? How to set volume in Python? How to convert dB to ratio? You can't really be asking all of that at once.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zvone I'm trying to set the volume of the main speaker throught Python. I have no idea which 1% I want, could you tell me? I just want to increase the volume of the main speaker by 1% in the Audio Mixer.</span>
