<p>I am completely new to Python and and still in my babysteps at coding and can't get this thing to work.</p>
<p>I am trying to build an auto-clicker as a learning experience, so I use pynput:</p>
<pre><code>from pynput.mouse import Button, Controller
from pynput.keyboard import Listener, KeyCode
</code></pre>
<p>But I get the error:</p>
<pre><code>    from pynput.mouse import Button, Controller
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pynput'
</code></pre>
<p>As troubleshooting I again typed in the cmd "pip install pynput" and got:</p>
<pre><code>Requirement already satisfied: pynput in c:\program files (x86)\python\python37-32\lib\site-packages (1.4)
Requirement already satisfied: six in c:\program files (x86)\python\python37-32\lib\site-packages (from pynput) (1.12.0)
</code></pre>
<p>Just to be sure, I also tried "pip3 install pynput" with the same result. When I am in the IDLE and type in "import pynput", I get no errors. I only have one python version installed.</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas what I am still doing wrong?</p>
<p>If you need any more information, just let me know.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.

<p>You should check the Interpreter the PyCharm uses for your project here:
File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Project: %Project_name% -&gt; Project Interpreter.
It should be same as where you installed pynput.</p>

<p>There might be one of these possibilities to this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The package was not correctly installed. Uninstall it and install it again and see if issue persists.</li>
<li><p>There could be permission issue on the path where the package is installed. Does it have full rw permissions so python can access it? If you are using linux, use  "sudo pip install"</p></li>
<li><p>If you have installed the package inside a virtualenv and running the program outside the virtualenv, the package will not be available.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You probably have multiple python installations and the one used by pycharm is not the one linked with the pip binary.</p>
<p>To solve this issue is it enough to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">install the library using pip as a module</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> understand what python interpreter you are actually using</p>
<pre><code>import sys
print(sys.executable)
</code></pre>
<p>the output is your <code>path_interpreter</code> (something like <code>/Users/xyz/bin/python</code>)</p>
<p><strong>Sept 2:</strong> run pip with that interpreter</p>
<p>from terminal: <code>path_interpreter -m pip install pynput</code></p>
<p>That's it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How are you running your program?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am using Pycharm.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I say "pip3 list" in the cmd I see pynput version 1.4 if that is what you meant.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perfect, you were right. Pynput wasn't installed there and when I fixed it, it worked! Thanks a lot!</span>
