<p>Ok so here is what I am trying to archieve:</p>
<ol>
<li>Call a URL with a list of dynamically filtered search results</li>
<li>Click on the first search result (5/page)</li>
<li><p>Scrape the headlines, paragraphs and images and store them as a json object in a a seperate file e.g.</p>
<p>{<br/>
 "Title": "Headline element of the individual entry",<br/>
"Content" : "Pargraphs and images in DOM order od the individual entry"
<br/>}</p></li>
<li><p>Navigate back to the search results overview page and repeat steps 2 - 3</p></li>
<li>After 5/5 results hav ebeen scraped go to te next page (click pagination link)</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 - 5 until no entry is left</li>
</ol>
<p>To visualize once more what is intedned:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QJPSA.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QJPSA.png"/></a></p>
<p>What I have so far is:</p>
<pre><code>#import libraries
from selenium import webdriver
from bs4 import BeautfifulSoup

#URL
url = "https://URL.com"

#Create a browser session
driver = webdriver.Chrome("PATH TO chromedriver.exe")

driver.get(url)

#click consent btn on destination URL ( overlays rest of the content )
python_consentButton = driver.find_element_by_id('acceptAllCookies')
python_consentButton.click() #click cookie consent btn

#Seleium hands the page source to Beautiful Soup
soup_results_overview = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source, 'lxml')


for link in soup_results_overview.findAll("a", class_="searchResults__detail"):

  #Selenium visits each Search Result Page
  searchResult = driver.find_element_by_class_name('searchResults__detail')
  searchResult.click() #click Search Result

  #Ask Selenium to go back to the search results overview page
  driver.back()

#Tell Selenium to click paginate "next" link 
#probably needs to be in a sourounding for loop?
paginate = driver.find_element_by_class_name('pagination-link-next')
paginate.click() #click paginate next

driver.quit()
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Problem</strong><br/>
The list count resets every time Selenium navigates back to te search results overview page
so it clicks the first entry 5 times, navigates to the next 5 items and stops</p>
<p>This is probably a predestinated case for a recursive approach, not sure.</p>
<p>Any advice on how to tackle this issue is appreciated.</p>

<p>The following set the results count to 20 and calculate the number of results pages. It clicks next until all pages visited. Condition is added to ensure page has loaded. I print the articles just to show you different pages. You can use this structure to create your desired output.</p>

<p>You aren’t using your link variable anywhere in your loop, just telling the driver to find the top link and click it. (When you use the singular find_element selector and there are multiple results selenium just grabs the first one). I think all you need to do is replace these lines </p>
<pre><code> searchResult = driver.find_element_by_class_name('searchResults__detail')
  searchResult.click()
</code></pre>
<p>With </p>
<pre><code>link.click()
</code></pre>
<p>Does that help?</p>
<p>OK.. with regard to the pagination you could use the following strategy since the 'Next' button disappears:</p>
<pre><code>paginate = driver.find_element_by_class_name('pagination-link-next')
while paginate.is_displayed() == true:
    for link in soup_results_overview.findAll("a", class_="searchResults__detail"):

        #Selenium visits each Search Result Page
        searchResult.click() #click Search Result

        #Scrape the form with a function defined elsewhere
        scrape()

        #Ask Selenium to go back to the search results overview page
        driver.back()

    #Click pagination button after executing the for loop finishes on each page
    paginate.click()

<span class="comment-copy">Can you share url?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes actually why not: <a href="https://www.cst.com/solutions#size=5&amp;TemplateName=Application+Article" rel="nofollow noreferrer">cst.com/solutions#size=5&amp;TemplateName=Application+Article</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@derp : Please try my solution.hope this helps.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The answer above is a clear, lean and structured approach that covers everything that was initially requested. OData queryables are rather new to me, quite useful especially in that case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That doesn't work, it returns: TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well that confuses me.  I actually am on mobile right now but I will check it out in a real browser shortly.  In the meantime I have a stupid question: did you confirm the links are found by your soup_results_overview?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now that I think of it why do you need beautiful soup for this? It seems like you could just find the links with selenium and not bother with the whole page source.  Admittedly I’m not familiar with beautifulsoup but it seems like selenium could do the job.</span>
