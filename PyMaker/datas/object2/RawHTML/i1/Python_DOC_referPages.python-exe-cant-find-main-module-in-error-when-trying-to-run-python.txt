<p>Apologies if there's missing information. I'm using python for medical research and am trying to run a program to count the number of blinks via video footage.

<p>Package install instructions were followed from <a href="https://www.learnopencv.com/install-opencv-3-and-dlib-on-windows-python-only/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jHYXt.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Attempt to direct terminal to look at file path</a></p>
<p>As you can see, the error message is</p>
<p>(opencv-env) C:\Users\wmj&gt;python C:\Users\wmj\Documents\Python Scripts\Biometrics\blink_detect-master.py -p -sp.dat
C:\Users\wmj\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\envs\opencv-env\python.exe: can't find '<strong>main</strong>' module in 'C:\Users\wmj\Documents\Python'</p>
<p>The contents of C:\Users\wmj\Documents\Python is just Anaconda3-2018.12-Windows-x86_64</p>
<p><strong>I have searched online and most solutions to this problem seem to be either solved by modifying the .py file or doing something with Pycharm</strong></p>
<p><em>What is the solution to this? I want to be able to run the script as a demonstration to my supervisor</em></p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Try first to cd to the exact location of the package and then run exactly as written in the readme instructions. 
Python has to get the full path of the script you're trying to execute and the script itself has to get the <code>sp.dat</code> file as an argument.</p>
