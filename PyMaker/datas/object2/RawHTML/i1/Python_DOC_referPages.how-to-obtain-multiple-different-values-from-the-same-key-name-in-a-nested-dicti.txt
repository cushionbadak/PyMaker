<p>I have a nested dictionary that is the match list of recent games played. Let's say this dictionary (match list) is stored in the variable <code>m</code>. Here's the contents:</p>
<pre><code>{
"matches": [
    {
        "platformId": "NA1",
        "gameId": 3000208798,
        "champion": 7,
        "queue": 420,
        "season": 13,
        "timestamp": 1552770736282,
        "role": "SOLO",
        "lane": "MID"
    },
    {
        "platformId": "NA1",
        "gameId": 3000221890,
        "champion": 2,
        "queue": 420,
        "season": 13,
        "timestamp": 1552768857241,
        "role": "NONE",
        "lane": "JUNGLE"
    },
    {
        "platformId": "NA1",
        "gameId": 2999711945,
        "champion": 72,

    {

<p>The match list contains 5 matches or games, and I have been trying to write a function that gets all 5 <code>gameId</code>s and returns them in the form of a <code>list</code>. </p>
<p>I tried something like:</p>
<pre><code>def getGameIds():
    gameIds = []
    for "gameId" in m:
        gameIds.append(m.get("gameId"))
    return gameIds
</code></pre>
<p>Thinking that I could loop through each occurrence of the key <code>"gameId"</code>, but I have not had any luck.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try iterating over each entry adding to a new list:</p>
<pre><code>l = [i['gameId'] for i in data['matches']]
# [i.get('gameId') for i in data['matches']] also works
</code></pre>
<p>Should produce list <code>l</code> containing:</p>
<pre><code>[3000208798, 3000221890, 2999711945, 2999696777, 2999691752]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're close, but not quite there. Think about every element you need to access: a dictionary, then a list, then a dictionary. Try this instead:</p>
<pre><code>def getGameIds():
    gameIds = []
    for subdict in m["matches"]:
        gameIds.append(subdict.get("gameId"))
    return gameIds
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>l = [v for k,v in m.items() if k == "matches"]
glist = [i['gameId'] for d in l for i in d]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the response, this worked. I realized I didn't think to reference the second level dictionary, which should have been obvious considering the original dictionary is nested.</span>
