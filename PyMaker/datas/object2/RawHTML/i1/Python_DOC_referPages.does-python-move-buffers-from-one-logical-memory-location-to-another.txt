<p>In simple python CLI script, I created a memory buffer with Byteio and wrote some data there. I call it from the terminal.</p>
<p>Let's say my program is in progress for one hour. </p>
<p><em>Can python interpreter implicitly move my buffer from one logical memory location to another during program execution?</em></p>

<p>No. CPython's garbage collector doesn't do moving or compacting. The reason for that is that it provided direct references to objects to C extensions in the early versions (before 2.0), and move to indirect references or read barriers would break C extension compatibility.</p>
<p>PyPy has a more efficient and advanced moving GC, since it doesn't maintain compatibility with C extensions.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This should not affect your directly, because I think that would be an implementation detail or even an OS decision, not something you as a programmer should need to worry about. Is it just curiosty on your part or are you having some issues with it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm just awfully curious :)))</span>
