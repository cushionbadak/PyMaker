<p>I want to configure Sublime Text 3 to build Python 3, but I don't seem to understand how the builds work. Many tutorials have told me to make a build file containing code such as:</p>
<pre><code>{
    'cmd': ['/usr/bin/python3', '-u', '$file'],
    'file_regex': '^[ ]*File "(â€¦*?)", line ([0-9]*)',
    'selector': 'source.python'
}
</code></pre>
<p>and save it as a file called <code>Python.sublime-build</code> or <code>python3.sublime-build</code> (much of the information I found was conflicting). One tutorial suggested creating a new folder in the ST3 Packages folder called <code>Python</code> and add the build file in there, whilst other tutorials suggested leaving it in the folder called <code>User</code>. </p>
<p>One tutorial explained how I had to change the Environment Variable <code>path</code> on my operating system to get it to work. That didn't seem to help either.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I added a folder <code>Python</code> to <code>Packages</code> (since it wasn't there already) and added in a build file with the name <code>Python.sublime_build</code> which featured only the code I posted above in it. Now when I attempt to run Sublime Text it gives me this error:</p>
<pre><code>Error trying to parse build system:
Expected value in Packages\Python\Python.sublime-build:2:5
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The reason you're getting the error is that you have a Unix-style path to the <code>python</code> executable, when you're running Windows. Change <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> to <code>C:/Python32/python.exe</code> (make sure you use the forward slashes <code>/</code> and not Windows-style back slashes <code>\</code>). Once you make this change, you should be all set.</p>
<p>Also, you need to change the single quotes <code>'</code> to double quotes <code>"</code> like so:</p>
<pre class="lang-json prettyprint-override"><code>{
    "cmd": ["c:/Python32/python.exe", "-u", "$file"],
    "file_regex": "^[ ]*File \"(...*?)\", line ([0-9]*)",
    "selector": "source.python"
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>.sublime-build</code> file needs to be valid <a href="http://json.org">JSON</a>, which requires strings be wrapped in double quotes, not single.</p>

<p><strong>Steps to Make Sublime Text a Python IDE (Windows)</strong></p>
<p>Tested successfully on Sublime Text 3. Assuming Sublime Text and package control are already installed . . .</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Install Python (python.org) and pay attention to where it is installed or choose a simple location like the C drive, agreeing to remove character limit at the end of the installation.</p></li>
<li><p>Install package SublimeREPL (Cntrl + Shift + P, Package Control - Install Package, SublimeREPL, Enter).</p></li>
<li><p>Go to Preferences, Package Settings, SublimeREPL, Settings - User.</p></li>
<li><p>Paste in the following, updating the file path to your python installation folder, as needed. You may customize these and choose whatever syntax you like (last line) but I prefer my output in plain text.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "default_extend_env": {"PATH":"C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\"},
  "repl_view_settings": {
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": false,
  "auto_indent": false,
  "smart_indent": false,
  "spell_check": false,
  "indent_subsequent_lines": false,
  "detect_indentation": false,
  "auto_complete": true,
  "line_numbers": false,
  "gutter": false,
  "syntax": "Packages/Text/Plain text.tmLanguage"
  }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Save and close the file (SublimeREPL.sublime-settings).</p></li>
<li><p>Go to Tools, Build System, New Build System.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace all existing text with the following:</p>
<pre><code>{
"target": "run_existing_window_command", 
"id": "repl_python_run",
"file": "config/Python/Main.sublime-menu"
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Cntrl + S or save as "C:\Users[username]\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\SublimeREPL-python.sublime-build" updating username or path as needed. This should be wherever your settings and builds are stored by Sublime Text.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to Tools, Build System, select SublimeREPL-python.</p></li>
<li><p>All done--now to test. Open or create a simple python file, having a *.py extension and save it wherever desired.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the file is open and selected in Sublime Text. Now, when you press Cntrl + B to build and run it, it will open another tab, titled "<em>REPL</em> [python]", executing and displaying the results of your python code.  </p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you would like to go a step further, I highly recommend making the follow changes, to allow Sublime to reload your executed python in the same window, when you press Cntrl+B (Build), instead of it opening a new tab each time:  </p>
<p>Add the following line in the "repl_python_run" command in (Preferences, Browse Packages) SublimeREPL\config\Python\Main.sublime-menu, right before the "external_id": "python" argument:</p>
<pre><code>"view_id": "*REPL* [python]",
</code></pre>
<p>and then to change the line:</p>
<pre><code>if view.id() == view_id
</code></pre>
<p>into:</p>
<pre><code>if view.name() == view_id
</code></pre>
<p>in SublimeREPL\sublimerepl.py.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are using PyQt, then for normal work, you should add "shell":"true" value, this looks like:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "cmd": ["c:/Python32/python.exe", "-u", "$file"],
  "file_regex": "^[ ]*File \"(...*?)\", line ([0-9]*)",
  "selector": "source.python",
  "shell":"true"
}

<h2>Run Python Files in Sublime Text3</h2>
<p>For Sublime Text 3,
First Install Package Control:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Ctrl + Shift + P, a search bar will open</li>
<li><p>Type Install package and then press enter 
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K59pN.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Click here to see Install Package Search Pic</a></p></li>
<li><p>After the package got installed. It may prompt to restart SublimeText</p></li>
<li>After completing the above step</li>
<li>Just again repeat the 1st and 2nd step, it will open the repositories this time </li>
<li>Search for Python 3 and Hit enter.</li>
<li>There you go.</li>
<li>Just press Ctrl + B in your python file and you'll get the output.

<p>It perfectly worked for me. Hopefully, it helped you too.

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "get sublime text 3 to work with python 3"? I use Sublime 3, downloaded from <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sublimetext.com/3</a>, and it works with python 3 out of the box...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could it be due to the fact that I downloaded the wrong version (x32 when I really needed x64)? Because we downloaded from the same location and I can't get python 3 to work at all. I run a 64-bit Operating System, but I assumed that wouldn't make a difference since many of my other programs are also x32.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Panicking about a downvote isn't going to get this fixed. Explain what you <i>want</i> done (clearly), answer @Moritz's question and explain what you've done thus far (because you've done something, but I'm not sure what). I also suggest removing all of the non-relevant information (I'll give an edit for that).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright, my apologies, I just overreacted since I've received multiple unexplained downvotes on questions I thought were clear tonight. @Moritz, every time I try to build a program with Sublime Text, it builds it using Python 2.7.3, when the build file I created specifies that it should be using Python 3.2.5 (the currently installed version of python 3 on my computer).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What OS, and is that the full error? (I can't help more as I've got to go.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much! This was causing me so much trouble. My apologies again for freaking out before, that was immature.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there's one more difference in the question vs this answer (which solved my problem+thanks); in the question, "..." is a character all on it's own, instead of 3 <code>.</code> characters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why "C:\python35\python.exe" does not work ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@shuboy2014 As I stated in my answer, you need to use forward slashes as path delimiters. After changing that, there's no reason why your path wouldn't work, as long as that is where Python is installed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is not the answer that we deserve..... but the answer that we needed. Thumbs Up!</span>
