<p>I'm new to Python so apologies if this is a basic mistake, I'm trying to write certain information to a txt file (OS is windows). </p>
<p>I want to write "Platform architecture:" as text, and write the output of platform.architecture to a file. Here is my current code:</p>
<pre><code>import.platform
file = open('C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\pc info.txt','w')

file.write('Platform architecture:'),platform.architecture
</code></pre>
<p>When I hit run a file named pc info is generated on my desktop as expected, but in the file only <code>Platform architecture:</code> is produced as text.
It seems <code>file. write platform.architecture()</code> isn't writing any information to the txt file?</p>
<p>Any ideas please?</p>

<pre><code>import.platform
</code></pre>
<p>Should have been:</p>
<pre><code>import platform
</code></pre>
<p>You should have called the <code>platform.architecture()</code> while writing to the file.</p>
<pre><code>file.write('Platform architecture:'),platform.architecture
</code></pre>
<p>Should have been:</p>
<pre><code>file.write('Platform architectue: {}'.format(platform.architecture()))

<p>Using <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-string-formatters-in-python-3" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.format()</code></a>:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The fact that you didn't <i>call</i> the <code>platform.architecture</code> function and that it isn't even <i>inside</i> the parentheses of <code>file.write(...)</code> tells me that you haven't grokked functions yet, and explaining how functions work really isn't what SO is for. It looks to me like you need to spend some time with a programming tutorial.</span>
