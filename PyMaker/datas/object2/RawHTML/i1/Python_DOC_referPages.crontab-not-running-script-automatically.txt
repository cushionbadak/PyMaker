<p>I created a custom python command called <code>expire_lesson.py</code>. In my terminal when I run python3 manage.py expire_lesson, the command successfully executes. I have added a cron job <code>* * * * * cd /Users/james/Desktop/elearning &amp;&amp; python3 manage.py expire_lesson</code> to run the script every minute. The issue is the cron job is not working. I believe it has something to do with the location of my cron job, but am unsure how to find the exact location, or if there is another issue. I would greatly appreciate any help in adding a cron job that runs <code>expire_lesson</code> successfully.</p>
<pre><code>class Command(BaseCommand):

    help = 'Expires old lesson objects'

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        Lesson.objects.filter(lesson_end__lt=timezone.now()).delete()
</code></pre>

<p>try with full path off python3 and then update your crontab line with full python3 path something like...</p>
<p><code>* * * * * cd /Users/james/Desktop/elearning &amp;&amp; /usr/bin/python3 manage.py expire_lesson</code></p>
