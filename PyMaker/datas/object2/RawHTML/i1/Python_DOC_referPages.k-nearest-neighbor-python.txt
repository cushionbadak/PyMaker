<p>I am new to data mining I was trying to implement the KNN Classifier on separate training and testing datasets. all tutorials that I see use train_test_split method to split the data set, whereas I already have the dataset split into Train and Test. How do I assign the target variable? </p>

<p>I am assuming that your <code>test</code> data is labelled (i.e. logically divided into test_X and test_y, and you would use this to test the performance of your model which you have trained on <code>train</code> data.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Load train data into (train_X, train_y) and load test data into (test_X, test_y)</p></li>
<li><p>Train your model with train data</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
knn_clf = KNeighborsClassifier()
knn_clf.fit(train_X, train_y)

<ol start="3">
<li>Predict on test data</li>

<li>Check accuracy of predictions</li>

accuracy = np.mean(test_y == y_pred)
