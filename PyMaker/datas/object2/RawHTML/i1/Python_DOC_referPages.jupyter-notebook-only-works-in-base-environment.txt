<p>Jupyter notebook stopped working as usual suddenly today.</p>
<p>If I launch Jupyter like this then everything works fine in base environment.</p>
<pre><code>activate base
jupyter notebook
</code></pre>
<p>But launching it in any other environment or simply without declaring environment</p>
<pre><code>activate XXX
jupyter notebook
</code></pre>
<p>results as a <code>localhost:8889/tree</code> blank page in browser.</p>
<p>Also there are no errors in Jupyter console.</p>
<p>I have reinstalled Anaconda and Jupyter, restarted PC and used ip 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost, but nothing helps.</p>
<p>What should I do? I really need to get environments back up fast.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Once you activate your conda environment, try to install Jupyter for that environment:</p>
<p><code>conda activate XXX
 conda install -c anaconda jupyter</code></p>
<p>Hope it helps. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A better way is to have one Jupyter with multiple kernels depending on your environment:</p>
<p>So all you need is:</p>
<pre><code>conda activate my_env
(my_env) conda install ipykernel -y
(my_env) python -m ipykernel install --user --name my_env --display-name "My Env"
(my_env) conda deactivate
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can open Jupyter and you will see “My Env” as a possible kernel. ;)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I see that it is necessary after reinstalling Anaconda, but what I don't get is why it stopped working after just closing and reopening Jupyter today. It worked fine for almost a year now. Anyway, it worked and thanks!</span>
