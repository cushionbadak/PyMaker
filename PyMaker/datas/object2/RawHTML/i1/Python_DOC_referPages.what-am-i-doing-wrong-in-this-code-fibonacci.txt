<p>I'm trying to create a program in python where the user would say which number Fibonacci number they would want, and then the program would print it, and the sum of all the numbers below. However, I'm having the problem that it's printing the wrong number, and the wrong sum. Here is my code :</p>
<pre><code>x = 0
y = 1
fib = 0
summen = 0
print("What Fibonaccinumber do you want?")
tall = input("I want number: ")
if tall == 1:
    print(x)
else:
    for count in range(int(tall)):
        fib = x + y
        x = y
        y = fib
        summen = summen + fib
print(fib)
print("The sum of all the fibonaccinumbers up to " + str(fib) + " is " + 
str(summen))
</code></pre>
<p>What have I done wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The user input is a str, you are checking a str with an int here:</p>
<pre><code>if tall == 1
</code></pre>
<p>Just cast it to int here:</p>
<pre><code>if int(tall) == 1
</code></pre>
<p>OR here:</p>
<pre><code>tall = int(input("I want number: "))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I suggest you to have the input immediately as a int like that:
a = int(input("something"))
Besides, it's a better practice to omit the str() in the print function, it transform the numbers automatically, you should also check about fstrings in python and the format strings function...</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>tall == 1</code> will never be true, because <code>tall</code> at that point is an <code>str</code> and <code>1</code> is an <code>int</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree for the immediate formatting as <code>int</code>, but what you said about printing is false.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tye formatting was not presented as part of the solution. Just a better practice than chaining elements... ðŸ˜‰</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yep no problem with that. I was just pointing out that <i>the print function, it transform the numbers automatically</i> is not true. <code>print(sum)</code> sure but not <code>print("sum is" + sum)</code> like OP could be tempted to deduce from your comment.</span>
