<p>When programming something in python I came across this bug where 2 variables that are certainly equal don't count as equal when put through an if <code>X == Y</code>:</p>
<p>Relevant segment of code:</p>
<pre><code> usernameinput = input("Enter your username: ")
    print("Just a sec...")
    passwordinput = hashingAlgorithm2()
    for line in Database:
        IDNumber, Username, Password = line.split(",")
        if Username == usernameinput:
            print(passwordinput)
            print(Password)
            if passwordinput == Password:            (this is the line in question)
                print("Test")
                LoggedIn = True
                ID = IDNumber
    if LoggedIn == False:
        triesLeft = triesLeft - 1
        print("Your username or password is wrong, you have", triesLeft ,"tries left.")
        if triesLeft &lt;= 0:
            The_Correct_Password
</code></pre>
<p>Relevant results:</p>
<pre><code>Enter your username: daniel
Just a sec...
Enter your password: **********
12894487843593301576106844
12894487843593301576106844

Your username or password is wrong, you have 2 tries left.
</code></pre>
<p>Does anyone know why is this happening?</p>
<p>I have no clue as to what even is the problem, as both variables are shown to be equal at the time of the if <code>X == Y</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can solve the issue by casting Password to an <code>int</code> (assuming your hash function always returns an <code>int</code>).</p>
<pre><code>   usernameinput = input("Enter your username: ")
   print("Just a sec...")
   passwordinput = hashingAlgorithm2()
   for line in Database:
       IDNumber, Username, Password = line.split(",")
       if Username == usernameinput:
           print(passwordinput)
           print(Password)
           if passwordinput == int(Password):  # Change here          
               print("Test")
               LoggedIn = True
               ID = IDNumber
   if LoggedIn is False:
       triesLeft = triesLeft - 1
       print("Your username or password is wrong, you have", triesLeft ,"tries left.")
       if triesLeft &lt;= 0:
           The_Correct_Password
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What happens if you look at the <code>repr</code>s of both items?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"<i>are certainly equal</i>" Hmm... can you confirm this? Perhaps they're of different types (e.g. one might be an int, another might be a string). Have you stepped through your code with a debugger?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>"certainly equal"</i> is a belief. To confirm, print values with their <i>type</i> before you do the check. I bet you will be surprised.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems that your second password has a <code>\n</code> char at the end. Indeed, your second print command write the password and skip a line. Try to remove this <code>EOL</code> char</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@D.Cronin just because a variable <i>prints</i> as a number doesn't necessary mean it <i>is</i> a number behind the scenes. <code>print('1')</code> and <code>print(1)</code> both output <code>1</code>.</span>
