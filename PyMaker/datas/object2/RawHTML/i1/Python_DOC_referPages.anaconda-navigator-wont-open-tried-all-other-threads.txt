<p>Uninstalled Anaconda Navigator last week and now it wont work once I've reinstalled it. </p>
<p>Windows search doesn't find an anaconda navigator program but in C:\Users\admin\Anaconda3\pkgs\anaconda-navigator-1.9.2-py37_0\Scripts, there is a anaconda navigator application. When i open this, a command prompt box flashes and vanishes within 0.5 secs. </p>
<p><code>C:\Users\admin&gt;where conda</code></p>
<p>Returns <code>'where is not a recognized internal or external command'</code> </p>
<p><code>conda update</code> has same response as well as all other 'conda' calls</p>
<p>Have uninstalled and ticked (and also unticked) the PATH option numerous times for both and hasn't worked. Have also tried clearing the PATH in the advanced section. </p>
<p>Basically, I've tried all the other suggestions on SO and cant find anything which works. </p>
<p>Edit: Calling python in the command prompt does work too - so python works but none of the anaconda options including spyder, jupyter etc etc. (RStudio does work in my computer though)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>The exact thing happened to me the yesterday.</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall the new anaconda installation.</li>
<li>Delete all the conda, anaconda files and folders on your computer. (They are located inside the <code>C:\Users\&lt;yourusername&gt;</code>, <code>C:\Users\&lt;yourusername&gt;\Appdata\Local</code> and <code>C:\Users\&lt;yourusername&gt;\Appdata\Roaming</code> folders).</li>
<li>Restart your computer.</li>
<li>Download the appropriate Miniconda installer.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The fix is in the latest Miniconda installers:</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Install it using the suggested settings.</li>
<li>Run the start menu shorcut <code>Anaconda Prompt</code>.</li>
<li>Execute the command <code>conda install anaconda anaconda-navigator</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully this will solve your issues (it solved mine).</p>
<p><em>I would suggest against having Anaconda in your <code>PATH</code> because it is designed to run inside an environment and having it run separately (outside the environment) might mess things up.</em></p>

<span class="comment-copy">You beauty. I spent so much time on this and nothing else worked until now. Thank you</span>
