<p>I am trying to draw a minimum bounding rectangle around an object in an image using openCV,</p>
<p>the cv2.minAreaRect is returning the rectangle of correct size but its orientation is off</p>
<p>Following is my codeSnippet</p>
<p>The following screentshot shows the image i am working

<p>In the next screenshot it shows the image with the detected border
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j36zb.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/j36zb.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>According to the opencv documentation linked here: <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dd/d49/tutorial_py_contour_features.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dd/d49/tutorial_py_contour_features.html</a>
 this should work</p>

<p><code>np.where()</code> returns things in the normal array index (row, column) order, but OpenCV expects points in (x, y) order, which is opposite to (row, column). This has the effect that you are flipping the points about the diagonal of the image.</p>
<p>Simply reverse the points by swapping the two columns. Better yet would just be to be more explicit with variables and not do everything on one line:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>y, x = np.where(binary == 0)
coords = np.column_stack((x, y))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Please do not post code in image form. It is too hard to read. Write the code as text in your post.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, this was the issue. I simply did a np.flip() to resolve the issue. But this is a better solution!</span>
