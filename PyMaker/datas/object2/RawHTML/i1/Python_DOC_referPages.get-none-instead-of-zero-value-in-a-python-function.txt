<p>I want to make a program which puts an array(1x9 has numbers from 0 to 9)  in memory and I want to check if an array I created is previously used. There will be 2 functions I will use. </p>
<p><strong>addMemory(list,previousStates)</strong> adds the newly created array into memory and <strong>checkMemory(list,previousStates)</strong> checks if the array is previously used or not. It returns 1 if the array is used and 0 if it is not.</p>
<p>I convert the array to a number by assuming that every element of the array is a digit for a 9-digit number. </p>
<p><strong>Ex:</strong> [2,5,3,4,1,6,8,9,7] is stored as 253.416.897. I want to test my functions. First print has the empty memory and the memory is checked and the array is added and the new memory is checked.</p>
<p>The output should have been </p>
<blockquote>
<p>0</p>
<p>1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but I get </p>
<blockquote>
<p>None</p>
<p>1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why I get 'None' instead of 0? Can you help please?</p>

<p>In your <code>checkMemory</code> function, because <code>len(previousStates)</code> is zero at first, your <code>for</code> statement is never executed and hence your function never reaches any <code>return</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You get <code>None</code> because you never enter the second loop in <code>checkMemory</code>, since  <code>previousStates</code> is empty.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I understand it now. I put it return 0 outside of the second loop and now it works</span>
