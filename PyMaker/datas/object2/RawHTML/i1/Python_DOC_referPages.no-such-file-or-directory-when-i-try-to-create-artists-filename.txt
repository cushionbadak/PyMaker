<p>All I'm trying to do is write a file to a certain directory. Here is my code. When I execute, I get "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/artists/Omar_Shariff.text' ", which seems odd since obviously it won't be available if I'm now creating it. </p>
<pre><code>f = open('/artists/'+filename , 'w')
</code></pre>
<p>So artists is the folder within my home directory. I'm able to write to this home directory, if I just remove the '/artists/' part. </p>
</div>

<p>The problem is that <code>/artists/</code> is not the same as <code>artists/</code>. The first path leads to a folder that is a child of the root directory, and the second path leads to a relative directory - a child of the current directory which is called "arists".</p>
<p>A visualization:</p>
<pre><code>-- root
  -- etc
  -- bin
  -- usr
  -- "/artists/"
  -- home
    -- your_user_name
      -- "artists/"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>./</code> instead of <code>/</code>:</p>
<pre><code>f = open('./artists/'+filename , 'w')
</code></pre>
<p>Or to be more precise, if the directory <code>artists</code> is in the same directory as your running script you can try this other method:</p>
<pre><code>import os
current_script_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
f = open(current_script_path + '/artists/'+filename , 'w')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You are trying to write to a directory at the root of the file system. Take away the first fwd slash if you want to write into a directory relative to the current one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which is to say -- <code>/artists</code> means there needs to be a directory in <code>/</code>  named <code>artists</code>.</span>
