<p>is it possible to generate loss curve for MLPregressor with lbfgs solver? it has been specified that it can be generated only for 'adam' solver.</p>
<p>if it can be done, kindly help me in this regard.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can plot <code>model.loss_curve_</code> on your dataframe, and you're good to go!</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Would you explain how this can be used regarding the question on "lbfgs" solver? I do not understand this part of your answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">model.loss_curve_ works only with the default solver 'adam' , not in lbfgs</span>
