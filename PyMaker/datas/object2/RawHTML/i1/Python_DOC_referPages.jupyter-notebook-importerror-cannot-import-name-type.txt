After my installation, I find after entering the command 'jupyter notebook' on the command-line , my browser will not open jupyter notebook, instead i got the follow error message error message:</p>

<p>So, what is the problem? I am new to python and jupyter notebook. Thank you very much.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Install anaconda , </p>
<p>"<em>Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment</em> " (As on google) </p>
<p>and then try Jupyter notebook

<p>Since the error seems to come from the tornado package,
i would try to reinstall tornado if this does not help I made the experience that the conda packages often work better in windows: so just reinstall jupyter notebook (best in a new env) using anaconda</p>
<p>Best of luck, installing jupyter notebook used to make me a lot of troubles as well.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is because Python3.5 has its own version typing (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html</a>), and it is incompatible with the installed version of jupyter/tornado
Upgrade to python3.6 could solve the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think it will be better to create a virtual environment. Then, re-install jupyter notebook under that environment.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">looks like it is using python 3.5. Don't think that's the issue. but good to check the PATH</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since the error comes from importing <code>Type</code> (which works on my computer) I'd recommend you upgrade the <code>typing</code> library (since there are newer Python versions). Try running <code>pip install --upgrade typing</code> from the command line as an admin.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i downloaded anaconda and am good, thanks everyone!</span>
