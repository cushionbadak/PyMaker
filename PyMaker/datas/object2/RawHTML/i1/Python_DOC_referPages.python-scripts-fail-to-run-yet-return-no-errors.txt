<p>I am on Windows with Python 3.7.2.
Whenever I run a code that is not within a forever loop, such as</p>
<pre><code>print("hello world")
</code></pre>
<p>nothing happens. In IDLE, it just sits there and does not output anything. In command prompt, the Window closes as soon as I run it.
When I make a forever loop, such as</p>
<pre><code>x = 0
while x == 0:
    print("hello world")
</code></pre>
<p>it works fine. At one point I was having problems with Python, so I reinstalled it.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your script <strong>IS</strong> running. It just prints within a few milliseconds and then exits the prompt. You can see this if you adjust your script like such:</p>
<pre><code>print("hello world")
input('press enter to end.') # will await user input
</code></pre>
<p>Or at least this would explain the command prompt issue I think. I'm not sure if this explains the IDLE error...we may need screenshots?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Interesting, perhaps a call to <code>flush</code> is needed to flush the output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you actually open up 'cmd' and navigate to the location of the code and run it, will the command box close?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In command prompt, this is expected behavior. The string was printed and the program exits. This all happens very fast.</span>
