<p>I have fetched movie data and saved the data as shown above (as a dictionary).
I want to save them to my Django project, but the code below is not working for me.</p>
<pre><code>if __name__=='__main__':
    movie_data_dict = data #like above format Json file
    for t, m in movie_data_dict.items():
         MovieData(title=t, movie_cd=m[0], movie_idx=m[1]).save()

class MovieData(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    movie_cd = models.IntegerField
    movie_idx = models.IntegerField
</code></pre>
<p>The error being thrown is:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3.OperationalError: table parsed_data_movie_data has no column movie_idx
...

django.db.utils.OperationalError: table parsed_data_movie_data has no column movie_idx
</code></pre>

<p>Another Error after makemigrations</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have set up your fields incorrectly. Django is currently expecting your values from your list to be of type <code>IntegerField</code>. You need to either use <code>movie_cd=int(m[0]), movie_idx=int(m[1])</code> or change the expected field to a <code>CharField</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I suspect you added the attribute <code>movie_idx</code> to <code>MovieData</code> after you had already had an initialized database. When you do that you need to run <code>manage.py -makemigrations</code> and then <code>manage.py -migrate</code> (while the server is not running) to add the new attribute to your SQL table.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There is a typo in your code. The third line should be <code>items()</code> instead of <code>itmes()</code>. Is this your issue? What output are you getting and what output are you expecting?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edit them. I want to save 2nd value to movie_idx. But That's items format can't save more than 2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean you can't save more than 2? Are you currently receiving an error or are you just not getting your desired output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for fixing the English sentence neatly. Attached is a picture with an error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you ran <code>manage.py -makemigrations</code> and then <code>manage.py -migrate</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>movie_cd=int(m[0])</code> same error, but <code>CharField</code> do well. Thank you! Grammer is very important.... I wasted 3 hours to this ㅠㅠ</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. I didn't know I had to do that. But Another error comes up, Output2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@이종성 it looks like you didn't link to your second issue</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JackMoody @handras I think <code>movie_cd=m[0], movie_idx=m[1]</code> this index numbering is problem. Is there any fit method for me? I can't find</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@이종성 I see the issue. See if my answer solves your problem.</span>
