<p>In our current project we are planing to use rabbitMQ and pika to implement queues.
can anyone help me with the below queries.</p>
<ol>
<li>what is the best adapter to use in pika for async operations </li>
<li>can we process messages in a queue parallel </li>
<li>what is the difference between AsyncioConnection  and SelectConnection adapters in pika </li>
</ol>

<p>I am one of Pika's maintainers. There is a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pika-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mailing list</a> that is the best place for asking questions about Pika.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use <code>SelectConnection</code> unless you are specifically using <code>asyncio</code> Python features elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes you can, but you must remember that Pika is not thread safe. There is <a href="https://github.com/pika/pika/blob/0.13.1/examples/basic_consumer_threaded.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">example code</a> demonstrating how to do work in separate threads then correctly acknowledge the message.</p></li>
<li><p>You'll have to do your own homework by looking at the code, but basically <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>AsyncioConnection</code></a> uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> Python 3 feature.</p></li>
