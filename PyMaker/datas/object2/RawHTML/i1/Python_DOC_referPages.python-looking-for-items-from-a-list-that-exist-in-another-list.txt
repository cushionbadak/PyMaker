<p>I want to calculate the bias between two curves but I have values of the first curve that are not in the second curve. So, I try to eliminate the values of the first curve that are not defined by the second curve. How will I proceed? Thank you for answering me.</p>

<pre><code>new_values = [val for val in list1 if val not in list2]
</code></pre>
