<p>I have a strange string concatenation error which I cannot seem to wrap my head around.</p>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>message = clientSocket.recv( 8000 ).decode( "UTF-8" )
data=message.split(",")#split the string using delimiter
ID=data.pop()#remove and return ID
ID=''.join(ID)#make the list into a string
ID=ID.replace("\n", "")#strip the \n
Pdata=data
print(ID)
print(type(ID))
print(Pdata)
#Dynamically make new filename using time and ID
filename = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%md_%H%M%S%f")+"."+ID+".csv"
print(filename)
</code></pre>
<p>The output here is:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>H3
&lt;class 'str'&gt;
['+2.07767994E-06', '+8.7037......']
.csv0314_185741582956.H3
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like somehow the first few characters is being overwritten with <code>".csv"</code>. I am trying to get the filename correct and it should be <code>'20190314_185741582956.H3.csv'</code>.</p>
<p>I cannot correctly open a filename and store <code>Pdata</code> in it with that error.
Am I missing something?</p>

<p>If the variable <code>ID</code> includes a <code>\r</code> character then you might get the output you show. Add another replace to replace “\r” with “” and you will get a better-looking (and valid) filename</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The code is working as you intended, even though there is a mistake in your string formatting(% is missing before d), apart from it it is working fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My guess is that <code>ID</code> has <code>\r</code> in it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/55173341/edit">edit</a> your code and create a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> — there's lots of extraneous code in it that likely has nothing to do with to the problem (and that others cannot use to reproduce the problem). We also need to see a sample of  of what data <code>message</code> might contain. Without those changes, we can only make guesses...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">'\r' was it..thanks guys!</span>
