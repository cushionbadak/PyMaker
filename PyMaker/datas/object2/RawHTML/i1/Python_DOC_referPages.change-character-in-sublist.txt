<p>I already know this is a really dumb question. I tried looking up my answer but I barely know what to ask. (sorry if the title is a little vague). But Here I go. I have a list of words. I'm wanting to get rid of the bad characters in that list. </p>
<pre><code>List = ["I?", "Can", "!Not", "Do.", "It"]
BadChars = ["?", "!", "."]

for word in List:
    for char in word:
        if char in BadChars:
            char = ""

print(List)
</code></pre>
<p>Again, I know this is very simple, but I just can't figure it out. Forgive me.</p>
<p>EDIT: Btw, it's not giving me an error. It's just returning the List untouched.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use the <code>replace</code> method, for each char for each word:</p>
<pre><code>List = ["I?", "Can", "!Not", "Do.", "It"]
BadChars = ["?", "!", "."]

for i in range(len(List)):
  for char in BadChars:
    List[i] = List[i].replace(char, "")

print(List) # ==&gt; ['I', 'Can', 'Not', 'Do', 'It']
</code></pre>
<p>A regex may be used as well:</p>
<pre><code>import re

List = ["I?", "Can", "!Not", "Do.", "It"]
BadChars = ["?", "!", "."]
rgx = '[%s]'%(''.join(BadChars))

List = [re.sub(rgx, "", word) for word in List]

print(List) # ==&gt; ['I', 'Can', 'Not', 'Do', 'It']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use a generator expression that iterates over each character in a string and retains characters that are not in <code>BadChars</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[''.join(c for c in s if c not in BadChars) for s in List]
</code></pre>
<p>This returns:</p>
<pre><code>['I', 'Can', 'Not', 'Do', 'It']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>List = ["I?", "Can", "!Not", "Do.", "It"]
l=[]
BadChars = ["?", "!", "."]
for i in List:
    for j in BadChars:
        if j in i:
            i=i.strip(j)
    l.append(i)


print(l)
</code></pre>
<p>Just use strip method to remove BadChars from List</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@davedwards I appreciate your comment. I already looked at this post about 20 minutes ago and it didn't help me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you're almost there! Problem is that you set the variable <code>char</code> to <code>''</code> if it is in the <code>BadChars</code> list and leave the <code>word</code> unchanged. What you really want is setting the char in <code>word</code> to <code>''</code> if it is in <code>BadChars</code>, this can be done using the <a href="https://www.pythoncentral.io/pythons-string-replace-method-replacing-python-strings/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>replace</code></a> method, like <code>word.replace("?", "")</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked! Thank you so much. I really do appreciate it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Glad it helped.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@davedwards Yeah I already upvoted and i'm going to Accept this answer when the cool down is off.</span>
