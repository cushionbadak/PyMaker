<p>I have recently started using glade, python gtk+ and cairo to build GUI apps.  I have constructed a DrawingArea widget in which I have used pixbuf to paint an image.  However when i try to draw shapes on the image, the shapes get drawn behind the image.</p>
<pre><code>def on_draw(self, wid, cr):
    #cr.rectangle(1500, 300, 400, 800)
    #cr.stroke()
    self.pb = GdkPixbuf.Pixbuf.new_from_file_at_scale("image2.jpg", 1920, 1080, True)
    Gdk.cairo_set_source_pixbuf(cr, self.pb, 0, 0)
    cr.paint()
</code></pre>
<p>Is there any way possible to get the shapes on top of the image?</p>
<p>Sorry for such a silly question. I am just new to this.</p>

<p>Why don't you just draw the shape ontop of the image instead of behind it?</p>
<p>So, instead of, well, drawing the shape first and then drawing the image, do it the other way around. First draw the image and then the shape.</p>
<pre><code>def on_draw(self, wid, cr):
    self.pb = GdkPixbuf.Pixbuf.new_from_file_at_scale("image2.jpg", 1920, 1080, True)
    Gdk.cairo_set_source_pixbuf(cr, self.pb, 0, 0)
    cr.paint()
    cr.set_source_rgb(0, 0, 0)
    cr.rectangle(1500, 300, 400, 800)
    cr.stroke()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, but that doesn't seem to work for me. Any other solution?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, right. Have to change back to a black source. I edited my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That works, thank you very much.</span>
