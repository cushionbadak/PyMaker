<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am required to include some form of error handling when the user inputs the file name such that if they put a file name which is not within the programs directory then it will appear with an error message. This is the code at the moment:</p>
<pre><code>board = [] 
fileinput = input("Please enter your text file name:")        
filename = fileinput + ".txt"   
file = open(filename, "r+")
for lines in file:
    board.append(list(map(int,lines.split())))
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure where to include the try/except as if I include it like this:</p>
<pre><code>board = [] 
fileinput = input("Please enter your text file name:")        
filename = fileinput + ".txt"
try:
    file = open(filename, "r+")
    except:
        print("Error: File not found")
    for lines in file:
        board.append(list(map(int,lines.split())))
</code></pre>
<p>Then I get the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>line 28, in 
          for lines in file:
      NameError: name 'file' is not defined</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know there probably is a very simple solution but I am struggling with wrapping my head around it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should include all lines which may occur error under <code>try</code>, so:</p>
<pre><code>board = [] 
fileinput = input("Please enter your text file name:")        
filename = fileinput + ".txt"
try:
    file = open(filename, "r+")
    for lines in file:
        board.append(list(map(int,lines.split())))
except:
    print("Error: File not found")
</code></pre>
<p>The way you presented, the program try to ignore error and go over, which ends with <code>NameError: name 'file' is not defined</code></p>
<p>The second problem in your case would be with scope - <code>file</code> is local variable in <code>try</code> and you call it outside of scope.</p>
