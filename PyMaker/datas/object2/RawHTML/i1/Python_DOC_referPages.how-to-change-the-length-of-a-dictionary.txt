<p>i have two dictionaries but not the same length. i want to make the length of the bigger dictionary the same as the small one.
i use this but it gives me error, i think, because i can't do it to a dictionary like that.
it gives me this error: TypeError: unhashable type: 'slice'</p>
<pre><code>if len(ints2answers) &gt; len(ints2questions):
    ints2answers = ints2answers[:len(ints2questions)]
elif len(ints2questions) &gt; len(ints2answers):
    ints2questions = ints2questions[:len(ints2answers)]

<p>As already pointed out the dictionary data structure doesn't provide slicing. But you can slice the <code>items</code> in the dictionary and convert it back to a dictionary.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {0:0, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3}
&gt;&gt;&gt; max_len = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; dict(list(d.items())[:max_len])
{0: 0, 1: 1}
</code></pre>

<p>You are getting a <em>Type Error</em> that means you are doing an unsupported operation for dictionaries.</p>
<p>Dictionaries are unordered lists. That means they have no order. You cannot say which is the first object of the dictionary, instead this is a set of <code>keys</code> and <code>values</code>.But slicing (<code>ints2answers[:len(ints2questions)]</code>) can only be done with a ordered list (i.e. <code>lists</code>, <code>tuples</code>, <code>strings</code>).</p>
<p>If you want to do the above operation with your data, you have to make it a 2D list. This can be done very easily with following code (or you can find your own way)</p>
<p><code>myList = [ [k,v] for k, v in myDict.items() ]</code></p>
<p>Now you can slice your list and do above operation. If you need to make it a dictionary again, <code>dict(myList)</code> will do the job.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can make the second dictionary smaller by deleting some items. But do you know which items to delete?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes. i want to delete the items from the last index of the smaller dictionary until the end, since they're sorted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">They're sorted? Does that mean they're <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>OrderedDict</code>s</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Once again, dictionaries are <i>not</i> sorted. Please add examples of your dictionaries.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That sounds bad. Again, please show us your dictionaries.</span>
