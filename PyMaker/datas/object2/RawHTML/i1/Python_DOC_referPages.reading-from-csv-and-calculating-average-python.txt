<p>I am really struggling with a programming task I have been handed, I have been asked to read from a CSV file which shows the names of beaches and a rating and then work out the average rating. Any help I could get with this would be great also I<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/G6V76.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the task given to me</a> am at a beginner level so please don't judge.</p>

<p>For reading CSV files, check out Python's standard library <code>csv</code>(<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/csv.html</a>)</p>
<p>This content will have enough tutorials and readings that will guide you through your assignment.</p>
<p>As for taking sums and averages, Python's built-in functions(<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html</a>) will do you enough good.</p>
<p>If you are stuck with any of them, feel free to add comments.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
