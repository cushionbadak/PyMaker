<p>I'm attempting to make a program that loops if the user inputs a particular phrase. Currently the program ends the loop no matter what the user inputs.</p>
<pre><code>umlist = ['um', 'UM' , 'Um' ]
while True:
    phrase = input('Say something. ')
    umcheck=phrase.split()
    if umcheck in umlist:
        print("You said um, try again")
    else:
        break
print("Well done, you didn't say um.")
</code></pre>
<p>What do I need to change to have the program detect and loop if a user inputs "um"</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can achieve that with a simpler solution:</p>
<p>Make your input lowercase, and then just check for 'um' in that:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    phrase = input('Say something. ')
    umcheck=phrase.lower().split()

    if 'um' in umcheck:
        print("You said um, try again")
    else:
        break
print("Well done, you didn't say um.")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code>in</code> looks for the occurrence of the <code>list</code> in the other <code>list</code>. It doesn't perform the intersection test as you think it does.</p>
<p>Just to illustrate, the only way you could make your condition match would be to put a list in a list, like this:</p>
<pre><code>umlist = ['um', 'UM' , 'Um', ["my","sentence"] ]
umcheck = ["my","sentence"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; umcheck in umlist
True
</code></pre>
<p>There are ways with <code>any</code> and other (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3170055/test-if-lists-share-any-items-in-python">Test if lists share any items in python</a>). My approach would be to work with <code>set</code>. Create a set of words you don't want to see, and see if the set of words the user inputted intersects:</p>
<pre><code>umlist = {'um', 'UM' , 'Um' }
while True:
    phrase = input('Say something. ')
    umcheck=set(phrase.split())
    if not umcheck.isdisjoint(umlist):
        print("You said um, try again")
    else:
        break
print("Well done, you didn't say um.")
</code></pre>
<p><code>umcheck.isdisjoint(umlist)</code> returns <code>True</code> if both sets have no element in common. Negate that for your test (or inverse the <code>if</code> branches for more clarity)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>At first, <code>umcheck</code> is a list! not a word.</p>
<p>exp:</p>
<pre><code>phrase = "this is an um test"
</code></pre>
<p>then:</p>
<pre><code>umcheck =&gt; ['this', 'is', 'an', 'um', 'test']
</code></pre>
<p>You can't find any list in <code>umlist</code>.</p>
<p>You can do this:</p>
<pre><code>umlist = ['um', 'UM' , 'Um' ]
end = False
while True:
    phrase = input('Say something. ')
    umcheck=phrase.split()
    for item in umcheck:
        if item in umlist:
          print("You said um, try again")
        else:
          end = True
    if end:
        break
print("Well done, you didn't say um.")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">with <code>if umcheck in umlist:</code>, you are checking if the whole list coming from <code>phrase.split()</code> is in <code>umlist</code>. you want to check each word</span>
