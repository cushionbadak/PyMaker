TypeError: multinomial() missing 1 required positional arguments: "num_samples"
Thanks!</p>

<p>It would be great to see your code. I the function could be written by you or imported from a module. Either way: There is a wrong or missing argument passed to the function.</p>
<p>If you show us your code or a broken down version of it, that would be advantageous!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The error is pretty much self explanatory. Pass an argument to the function (for example <code>multinomial(5)</code>) where <code>5</code> is the number of samples you want</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey Rafael, Many thanks for your help! The link is my code. I am very junior about it. Could you please help see the code? I saw many answers, but I cannot figure it yet. If you could help me find the errors in my code, it is perfect! I highly apperciate it!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey , I figure it out with your help! But I met a new one. backward() got an unexpected keyword argument 'retain_variables'</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I found the documentation for what I believe to be the function called: <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?highlight=multinomial#torch.multinomial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pytorch.org/docs/stable/…</a> Since num_samples has no standard value you will have to provide one, when calling the function. Since i have no idea of what all that stuff does i believe probs.multinomial() removes the requirement for input parameter. num_samples has to be an int and will determine the number of samples to draw</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I couldn't immediatly find the documentation for the backward() function. Eitherway retain_variables is no accepted parameter. Likely the parameter you want to = True is called differently. You could try other plausible names for the parameter or find the documentation. Edit: I could find a documented .backward() function with a retain_variables paramter in the torch.autograd module here: <a href="https://pytorch-zh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autograd.html?highlight=backward#torch.autograd.backward" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pytorch-zh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/…</a>  F seems to be torch.nn.functional so i am not sure how you will have to apply the correct function.</span>
