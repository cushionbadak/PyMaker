<p>I'm calling another python file from the current file, and using a function that calls all functions in the other file. </p>
<pre><code>def choose1():
    def openthis():
        import board1
        for i in dir(board1):
            item = getattr(board1,i)
            if callable(item):
                item()
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        openthis()
</code></pre>
<p>Note: <code>board1</code> is a python file.</p>
<p>With this function, I get the error:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: __init__() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'master' and 'widgetName'
</code></pre>
<p>I have looked around, and saw this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28122963/typeerror-init-missing-2-required-positional-arguments-client-socket-a">answer</a>, but it did not mention <code>master</code> and <code>widgetName</code>, and I'm unsure of what they mean and what I should do.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>if callable(item):
    item()
</code></pre>
<p><code>item</code> is a class, and you're attempting to create an instance of that class, but that class has two required arguments, and you're not passing any arguments at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your file imports all of tkinter and random directly into its own namespace. So, when you iterate over everything in that namespace, you get the objects from those modules too.</p>
<p>One fix would be to not use <code>from ... import *</code>, but import the modules themselves - <code>import tkinter</code>. But really the full fix is not to do what you're doing at all.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"using a function that calls all functions in the other file" - first, that's a terrible idea. Second, classes are callable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The code you posted isn't enough for us to reproduce your problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A class? What makes it into a class?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're iterating over all the things in the <code>board1</code> module.  One of those things happens to be a class, and classes are callable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are no classes in <code>board1</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Given the error you're getting, that seems unlikely.  Edit the question to include the contents of <code>board1</code>.</span>
