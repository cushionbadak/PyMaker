<p>You are trying to access <code>id</code> attribute of your foreign key relation with</p>
<pre><code>{{ item.order_id }}
</code></pre>
<p><code>order_id</code> is your actual field name. This field does not return the id of related object rather returns related object itself. If you want to show id of related object, you have to do</p>
<pre><code>{{ item.order_id.id }}
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>{{ item.item_id.id }}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm afraid your "problem" is quite unclear - actually I just don't have a clue what you're asking for. And please don't tell that you cannot find how to read records from your database using the ORM, because this is extensively documented in both the tutorial and manual.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i m new to Django ORM , currently developing an application for my college project. i have 3 tables in my models.py file . the 3rd table is having 2 foreign key from the 1st and 2nd table. by applying table_name.objects.all() command the 1st and 2nd table is showing records , but for the 3rd table its not working . you can see the screenshot above . i want the data in place of (order_table object 1 , item_table object1 ) . i have attached the code of my models.py file as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please attach your <code>template</code> code.</span>
