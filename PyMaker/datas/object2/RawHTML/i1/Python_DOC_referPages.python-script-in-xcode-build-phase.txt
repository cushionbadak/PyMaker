<p>I try to generate code by <a href="https://nshipster.com/swift-gyb/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GYB</a>. I did everything and it works perfectly in a new and clean project. Tests and code are generated in the right way. When I tried to integrate my solution in the main project I got a weird message:</p>
<pre><code>line 2: import: command not found
line 4: syntax error: unexpected end of file
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like it doesn't see python or smth</p>
<p>Is there any project settings about python or scripts environment?</p>
<p>The main project is like from 2015</p>

<p>For someone who needs it.</p>
<p>Replace the original part of the script</p>
<pre><code>./path/to/gyb
</code></pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre><code>python /path/to/gyb
</code></pre>
<p>I have no idea why it doesn't recognize python script from the beginning in the old project.</p>
