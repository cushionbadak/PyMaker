<p>Hello I'm having a bit of an issue with web scrapping this URL I have been writing it in my code editor but also doing it in cmd as i go along to make sure i getting it right. I have hit a issue which says:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'h1'
</code></pre>
<p>I have also done 'p' as well to see if it could maybe get a paragraph off the page but that did not worth either.Please check the above issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for you help</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Change this: </p>
<pre><code>page_soup = (uClient.read(), "html.parser")
</code></pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre><code>page_soup = soup(uClient.read(), "html.parser")
</code></pre>
<p>It creates BeautifulSoup object.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">First you should post your code in this question instead of an image.  For larger issues we cannot help without copy-pasting to figure out what's wrong when the code is run.  For your case I would replace the problem line with <code>page_soup[0].h1</code> since it is the first object in your tuple that actually has header data</span>
