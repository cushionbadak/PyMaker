<p>In Zapier, I have a "Run Python" action triggered by a "Twitter" event. One of the fields passed to me by the Twitter event is called "Entities URLs Display URL". It's the list of anchor texts of all of the links in the tweet being processed.</p>
<p>Zapier is passing this value into my Python code as a single comma-separated string. I know I can use <code>.split(',')</code> to get a list, but this results in ambiguity if the original strings contained commas.</p>
<p>Is there some way to get Zapier to pass this sequence of strings into my code as a sequence of strings rather than as a single joined-together string?</p>

<p>At this time, all inputs to a code step are coerced into strings due to the way data is passed between zap steps. This is a great request though and I'll make a note of it internally.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That's unfortunate. If passing actual sequences is too hard to add, perhaps add JSON encoded versions of these fields? They'd still be strings, but at least they could be parsed unambiguously.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Totally! I understand it's a pain point. If you predict a lot of commas in twitter anchor text and this is important, the best thing to do is make a little <a href="https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-cli" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CLI app</a> that replicates the twitter action. Then you can set the output to be a json string and we won't touch it. I've done this in a couple of places and it works great (outside the added burden of having to interface with twitter yourself when we should take care of that for you)</span>
