<p>Sorry for asking i have searched a lot but cant find what i need.</p>
<p>I need this list to be written to a csv file on one row(1) and each element from A to E</p>
<pre><code>coluna_socio = ['bilhete', 'tipo', 'nome', 'idade', 'escalao']
outfile = open('socios_adeptos.csv', 'w', newline='')
writer = csv.writer(outfile)
for i in range(len(coluna_socio)):
    writer.writerow([coluna_socio[i]])
</code></pre>
<p>Ive tried almost everything and it always write on on column or just in on cell(A1)
Thanks.</p>

<p>You can use the string join method to insert a comma between all the elements of your list. Then write the resulting string to file. The <code>csv</code> module isn't necessary in this case.</p>
<p>For example ...</p>
<pre><code>with open('socios_adeptos.csv', 'w') as out:
    out.write(','.join(coluna_socio))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should call the <code>csv.writer.writerow</code> method with the list directly:</p>
<pre><code>with open('socios_adeptos.csv', 'w', newline='') as outfile:
    writer = csv.writer(outfile)
    writer.writerow(coluna_socio)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I could write it in one row with your code, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>coluna_socio = ['bilhete', 'tipo', 'nome', 'idade', 'escalao']
outfile = open('socios_adeptos.csv', 'w', newline='')
writer = csv.writer(outfile)
writer.writerow(coluna_socio)
outfile.close()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">That writes everything with a coma in the first cell A1..i need each item without comas and each on his own cell, like: A1 Bilhete B1 Tipo C1 Nome..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How are you reading the resulting file? You could replace <code>','</code> with any delimiter</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need it to be on a Excel worksheet, one row 5 columns and what i always got is one row one column</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure how your excel is configured, but you could try <code>out.write('\t'.join(coluna_socio))</code> which uses a tab as a delimiter. Otherwise, when you import into excel, try to set comma as delimiter</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ive tried this, it writes on same row and same cell A1..not what i want..could this be a problem from my ms excel?</span>
