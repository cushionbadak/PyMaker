<p>I have compressed an image in python2.7 using PIL library like this:</p>
<p>picture.save("Compressed_"+file,"JPEG",quality=85) </p>
<p>Can I decompress it? 
I have searched so many sites, but couldn't find decompression related information.</p>
<p>I have to compress an image (should reduce file size) and decompress it back,what to do?</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>JPEG use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lossy compression</a> method to do compression, which means there will be some data lost during compression. This data lost is irreversible.</p>
<p>You may try some lossless compressing image format, for example <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PNG</a>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">If you expect to get the full quality image back: the JPEG compression is not lossless.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If we are compressing png images, then how we will decompress it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The compression is part of the file format, you just open it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If we repalce the "jpeg" with "png" when compressing a png image, then also..how can we decompress that resulting image?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When <code>PIL</code> loads that image, it will "automatically" decode the image data.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank u so much</span>
