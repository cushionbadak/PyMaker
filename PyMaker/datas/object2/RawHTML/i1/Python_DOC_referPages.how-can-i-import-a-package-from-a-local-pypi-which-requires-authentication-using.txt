<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I've uploaded a python package up to a local PyPI inside Artifactory. I've installed it on my system with <code>pip install foo</code> (I need to authenticate). I can do <code>python -c "import foo"</code> without any issue.</p>
<p>When I try to make use of this module inside PyCharm (with <code>import foo</code>), PyCharm throws me <code>unresolved reference 'foo'</code>.</p>
<p>So I went into Preferences-&gt;Project:myproject-&gt;Project Interpreter-&gt;Available Packages-&gt;Manage Repositories and added the local PyPI as shown below: </p>

<p>but when reloading the package list in the 'Available Packages' I get the following error dialog:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Imhvv.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt='Error dialog displaying "Packages - Error loading package list:Request failed with status code 401"' src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Imhvv.png"/></a></p>
<p>401 forbidden makes since since I was never prompted for credentials, but I'm not sure how to proceed.</p>
<h1>Question</h1>
<p>How can I import package <code>foo</code> inside a PyCharm project?</p>

<p>PyCharm doesn't support authentication for custom package repositories, please vote for the corresponding ticket in the IDE's bug tracker <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-26556" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-26556</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, you should be fine installing the package from the terminal on the interpreter used as a project interpreter in PyCharm (<strong>Settings | Project ... | Project Interpreter</strong>).</p>
