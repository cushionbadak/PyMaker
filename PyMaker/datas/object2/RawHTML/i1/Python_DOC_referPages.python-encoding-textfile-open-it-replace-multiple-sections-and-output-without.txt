<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What i have is a file "test.xls" wich is basically a old xls (xml formatting) which looks like this in notepad:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table cellspacing="1" rules="all" border="1"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Row A&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row B&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Row C&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;New York&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;warm&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;San Francisco&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;40&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;hot&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now I'm using Python to convert it to a .txt (flatfile) which i can lateron import to my MSSQL Database.</p>
<p>What i have so far:</p>
<pre><code>import codecs
import os

# read the file with a specific encoding
with codecs.open('test.xls', 'r', encoding = 'ansi') as file_in, codecs.open('test_out.txt', 'w') as file_out:
    lines = file_in.read()
    lines = lines.replace('&lt;tr&gt;', '')

    # save the manipulated data into a new file with new encoding
    file_out.write(lines)
</code></pre>
<p>This approach results in a .txt like this:</p>
<pre><code>Row A;Row B;Row C

New York;23;warm

San Francisco;40;hot
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to get rid of the empty lines by multiple approaches, the last one was:</p>
<pre><code>for lines in file_in:
        if line != '\n':
            file_out.write(lines)
</code></pre>
<p>But the File either looks the same or is completly empty</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To get rid of the empty lines:</p>
<p>list.txt:</p>
<pre><code>Row A;Row B;Row C

New York;23;warm

San Francisco;40;hot
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Hence</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>logFile = "list.txt"
with open(logFile) as f:
    content = f.readlines()

# to remove empty lines
content = [l.strip() for l in content if l.strip()]
for line in content:
    print(line)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>OUTPUT</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>Row A;Row B;Row C
New York;23;warm
San Francisco;40;hot
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>
<p>perhaps, to read from the file and then overwrite it, using a list that stores the results which can later be written to the file.</p>
<pre><code>logFile = "list.txt"                # your file name
results = []                        # an empty list to store the lines
with open(logFile) as f:            # open the file
    content = f.readlines()         # read the lines

# you may also want to remove empty lines
content = [l.strip() for l in content if l.strip()]   # removing the empty lines
for line in content:
    results.append(line)    # appending each line to the list

print(results)              # printing the list


with open(logFile, "w") as f:    # open the file in write mode
    for elem in results:         # for each line stored in the results list
        f.write(str(elem) + '\n')  # write the line to the file
    print("Thank you, your data was overwritten")  # Tadaa-h!

<span class="comment-copy">After i use your last few edit lines i can output it into the console with no empty lines but ä,ö,ü issues. How do i get this result into a file rather than print to console?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@J.Doe Check the edited answer, I have demonstrated a way to read from the file and then write it back to it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@J.Doe Sure, Ill do some more comments</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@J.Doe Added comments :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much. At the end i had to copy your solution and manipulate it to get it work. somewhere along the way of editing my previous solution i lost trak and made i guess some minor mistakes. But now it is working =)</span>
