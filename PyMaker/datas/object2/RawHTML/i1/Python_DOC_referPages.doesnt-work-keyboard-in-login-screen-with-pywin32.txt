<p>I'm running the following code on the windows login screen, but the password doesn't write, how can I do? or how can I enter a password</p>
<pre><code>import win32api
#running this code in windows login screen
time.sleep(10)
#password
win32api.keybd_event(55, 0, 0, 0) 
win32api.keybd_event(55, 0, 0, 0)
win32api.keybd_event(55, 0, 0, 0)
#password
win32api.keybd_event(13, 0, 0, 0) #enter
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First, you should set your program to run as a server, because once you log off the windows, your program will end. Second, <code>KEYEVENTF_KEYUP</code> should be added after each key has been pressed:
<code>win32api.keybd_event(55, 0, KEYEVENTF_KEYUP, 0);</code></p>
<p>However, this method of automatic login is not very cool. You could use the tool--<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autologon" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Autologon</a></p>
<p>Anther way:set the registry, under the key <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon</code>, set as below,</p>
<pre><code>"AutoAdminLogon"="1"            //enable Auto Logon
"DefaultUserName"="User"        //set the User Name
"DefaultDomainName"="Domain"    //set the Domain Name
"DefaultPassword"="Password"    //set the Password
</code></pre>
