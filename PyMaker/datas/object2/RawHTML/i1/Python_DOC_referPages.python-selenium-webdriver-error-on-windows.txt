<p>According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48859312/python-no-such-file-or-directory-getattribute-js">this</a> answer only reinstalling is the way.</p>
<p>it quotes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Incase the getAttribute.js file doesn't gets downloaded properly
  Selenium and webdriver modules may not work properly. The issue can
  arise if the Selenium Client encounters any error during its
  transmission or storage.</p>
<p>Selenium Team is currently working on the issue
  <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/5378" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SeleniumHQ/selenium/5378</a> to generate the binary checksum of the
  Downloaded Selenium Client which will help you to avoid encountering
  errors which may have been introduced during its transmission or
  storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try first uninstalling: </p>
<p><code>pip uninstall selenium</code></p>
<p>Then install it again:</p>
<p><code>pip install selenium --upgrade</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! I am installing python modules directly not through pip with python setup.py install. I have a strong firewall and can't use pip as all the ports are closed...Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi,  I have installed it from here <a href="https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/Selenium" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/SeleniumHQ/Selenium</a>. Downloaded the zip, unarchieve it and installed it from py folder with python setup.py install. You can close the ticket as i reinstalled the selenium- Windows version from here and all was fine! <a href="https://pypi.org/project/selenium/#files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pypi.org/project/selenium/#files</a>  Seems that the installation was broken.  Thank you!</span>
