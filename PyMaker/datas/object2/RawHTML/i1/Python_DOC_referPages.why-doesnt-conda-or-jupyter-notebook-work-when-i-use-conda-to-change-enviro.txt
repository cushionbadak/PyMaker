<p>When I change environments using </p>
<pre><code>&gt;conda activate myenv
</code></pre>
<p>I can't use conda to get back and jupyter notebook doesn't work.</p>
<p>Is something going on with the path when I change environments?</p>
<p>edit: looks like installing notebook (conda install nb_conda) fixes the second problem, and changing the global environment path fixes the first, but I'm still confused about why. </p>
<p>Why does conda work from base, while I need to add ..user.. ..\anaconda3 to my path to make it work from inside myenv?</p>
<p>I'm also getting an internal server error when I activate the conda tab, which (the tab) was never there before.</p>

<p>You can change system path:</p>
<p>Go to <code>Control Panel\System and Security\System</code>, and click on <code>Advanced system settings</code> in the left panel.</p>
<p>Click on <code>Environment variables</code> on the bottom of the window that opens.</p>
<p>A new window will open, in the bottom section (system variables) find <code>path</code>. Double click on that and change it as you like (e.g. if you want to add conda path)</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">This shouldn't be happening. Can you please include the value of <code>PATH</code> before and after activation? Also, include the output from <code>conda info</code> so we know some context.</span>
