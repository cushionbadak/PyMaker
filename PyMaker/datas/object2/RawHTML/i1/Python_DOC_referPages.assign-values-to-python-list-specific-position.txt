<p>I am newbie in Python and maybe my problem is very simple.</p>
<p>I have created a list of 250 zeros called <em>x</em>, <code>x = np.zeros(250)</code>, and I have a loop where I perform some calculations, at each iteration I produce two x's for example in the first iteration the x[0] and x[1] and so on in a list called temp_x. i.e., the first temp_x has the x[0] and x[1]</p>
<p>I want to save the output at the end of each iteration to the corresponding positions of the x. For example at the end of the first iteration temp_x has two values I want to assign them to the first positions of x.</p>
<p>What I am doing wrong?</p>
<pre><code>x[i, i+1] = x_temp
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should work just fine
<code>x[i] = x[i+1] = x_temp</code></p>
</div>

<p>As mentioned in @IAmVisco's answer, chained assignment will work.</p>
<p>However, to go into the reason your code doesn't:</p>
<p>When you type something like <code>x[i, i+1]</code>, Python understands the value in the square brackets as a <code>tuple</code>, and therefore actually attempts to execute <code>x[(i, i + 1)]</code>, which accesses the element at row <code>i</code> and column <code>i + 1</code>. Since there is no such element (<code>x</code> is a 1D array), it fails with the error "too many indices for array".</p>
<p>If you actually want to access two (or more) elements in that way, your indices should be in a form of a <code>np.ndarray</code> (a <code>list</code> would work too):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = np.ones(10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[np.array([0, 1])] = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
array([2., 2., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1., 1.])
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>I'm not sure IAmVisco's answer will do what is required, it will instead set both of the elements of x to the list x_temp.</p>
<p>What I think you need instead is:</p>
<pre><code>x[i], x[i+1] = x_temp
</code></pre>
<p>This unpacks each element of <code>x_temp</code> into each element of <code>x</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Apparently numpy creates not a list but a <code>numpy.ndarray</code> object with <code>np.zeros()</code> call, I haven't worked with it much but it still worked for me in REPL</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It does not even have to be a numpy array, just a list. <code>x[[0, 1]] = 2</code> will work as well.</span>
