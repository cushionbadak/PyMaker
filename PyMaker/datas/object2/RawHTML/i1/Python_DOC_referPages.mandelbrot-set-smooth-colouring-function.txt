<p>I programmed the Mandelbrot set with python but that was weird looking so I searched for smooth colors.
I've programmed a smooth colouring function using log and linear interpolation but whatever I try I can't get what I want:</p>
<pre><code>self.palette = [(3, 25, 61),(5, 43, 107),(7, 61, 153),(20, 96, 226),(20, 164, 226),(74, 181, 226),(138, 211, 242),(205, 234, 247),(225, 237, 242),(255,255,255)]
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my palette</p>
<pre><code>if n == self.max_iterations:
    self.screen.set_at((x, y), (110, 13, 13))
else:
    gradient = 1 + n - math.log(math.log(abs(m))) / math.log(2.0)
    iteration = n + 1 - gradient
    color1 = list(self.palette[n % 10])
    if n % 10 &lt;= 8:
        color2 = list(self.palette[n % 10+1])
    else:
        color2 = list(self.palette[-1])

    color = [[], [], []]
    for number, elt in enumerate(color):
        color[number] = color1[number] + (iteration % 1)*(color2[number]-color1[number])

    self.screen.set_at((x, y), tuple(color))
</code></pre>
<p>Here my colouring function</p>
<p>And here what I get</p>

<p>As you can see colors are smooth but in the wrong way there is no continuity in the colors</p>
<p>I would like to have something like this : </p>
<p>ideal result</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nJeBY.jpg"/> </p>
<p>we do not see color gaps</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It looks like you're selecting the pixel-color based on a discrete value (n, the escape-time). </p>
<p>I would suggest:  </p>
<p>1) Plot your color-vs.-n on a 1D line. Does it appear continuous? If not, choose a color-map that appears continuous w.r.t. increasing n.</p>
<p>2) Find a way to make n continuous, not discrete. One way to do this is by calculating your max-escape-time for the viewing window, and then dividing all other escape-times by this value, to yield a more continuous field. See this link on escape-time normalization:<br/>

<p>I believe if you meet both of the above criteria, the field surrounding the main image will appear continuous instead of having the 'iso-line' appearance.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">how do you generate your mandelbrot set? I suspect you might be working on a data of not high enough resolution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A cheat would be: smooth the image with a filter and draw the sharp set of converging data on top again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">possible duplicate of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53666890/2521214">Mandelbrot Set - Color Spectrum Suggestions?</a> , also your image looks like was post processed with smooth filter ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@adrtam I dont think that the problem is the resolution</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Spektre my image ? The second one ?</span>
