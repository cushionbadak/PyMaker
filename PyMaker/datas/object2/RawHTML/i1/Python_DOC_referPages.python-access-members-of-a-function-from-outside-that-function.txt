<p>Say I had two functions, one belonging to another like so.</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    def bar():
        print("im bar")
    print("im foo and can call bar")
print("i can call foo, but not bar?")
</code></pre>
<p>How would refer to or call bar?
Would I do <code>foo.bar()</code>?</p>
<p>If <code>bar</code> were not a function like if <code>bar = 1</code> then how would I access that?</p>
<p>I'm aware I could move <code>bar</code> out of <code>foo</code> but is there any other way?</p>
</div>

<p>I don't think you can do what you want to do here, i.e. calling <code>foo.bar</code> and expect to get the result. You can, however, turn <code>foo</code> into a class and then try it that way.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>bar</code> is not a member of <code>foo</code>. It is a local variable. To access the value outside you must return the value</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>bar</code> only exists while <code>foo</code> is executing. As soon as <code>foo</code> ends, <code>bar</code> goes out of scope and ceases to exist. And that's just the first conceptual problemâ€¦</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it sounds like this should be in a class with a staticmethod</span>
