<p>I have code I want to run 500 times in a bash script (although currently I have been stuck on making a for loop in bash for what I want, so I am thinking I can automate making a larger bash script via python). However, I want one part of to change with each of the 500 iterations - I have a file 'individual1' that needs to increase with each line (so individual1, individual2, individual3 etc.)</p>
<p>Currently in python I have simply done:</p>
<pre><code>x  = 'plink --bed chr${ID}.bed --bim chr${ID}.bim --fam chr${ID}.fam --extract snps.txt
--recode vcf-iid --out output${indiv}chr${ID}vcf --keep-fam individual1.txt'

text = ((x+'\n')*500)    

f = open("bash.txt", "r")
out = open("outfile.bg", "w")
for line in f:
    out.write("DBPH" + 1)
out.close()
print(text)
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Although I know this for loop isn't right at all, from trying to learn from similar questions on here I'm still not sure the next steps to take to get it as I want.</p>
<p>The output in the text file would look like:</p>
<pre><code>plink --bed chr${ID}.bed --bim chr${ID}.bim --fam chr${ID}.fam --extract snps.txt
--recode vcf-iid --out output${indiv}chr${ID}vcf --keep-fam individual1.txt

plink --bed chr${ID}.bed --bim chr${ID}.bim --fam chr${ID}.fam --extract snps.txt
--recode vcf-iid --out output${indiv}chr${ID}vcf --keep-fam individual2.txt
</code></pre>
<p>so I'm getting individual1, individual2 etc. Any help/guidance would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Here is a little script to output that file in the directory that you run the script in.</p>
<pre><code>x  = 'plink --bed chr${ID}.bed --bim chr${ID}.bim --fam chr${ID}.fam --extract snps.txt --recode vcf-iid --out output${indiv}chr${ID}vcf --keep-fam '

times_written = 1

out = open("outfile.bg", "w")
while times_written - 1 &lt; 500:
    out.write(F"{x}individual{times_written}.txt\n")
    times_written += 1
out.close()
</code></pre>
<p>This block will produce output like:</p>
<pre><code>plink --bed chr${ID}.bed --bim chr${ID}.bim --fam chr${ID}.fam --extract snps.txt
--recode vcf-iid --out output${indiv}chr${ID}vcf --keep-fam individual1.txt
plink --bed chr${ID}.bed --bim chr${ID}.bim --fam chr${ID}.fam --extract snps.txt
--recode vcf-iid --out output${indiv}chr${ID}vcf --keep-fam individual2.txt
</code></pre>
<p>This code here will do the same thing but with a space in the middle:</p>
<pre><code>x  = 'plink --bed chr${ID}.bed --bim chr${ID}.bim --fam chr${ID}.fam --extract 
snps.txt --recode vcf-iid --out output${indiv}chr${ID}vcf --keep-fam '

times_written = 1

out = open("outfile.bg", "w")
while times_written - 1 &lt; 500:
    out.write(F"{x}individual{times_written}.txt\n\n")
    times_written += 1
out.close()
</code></pre>
<p>This will produce output like:</p>
<pre><code>plink --bed chr${ID}.bed --bim chr${ID}.bim --fam chr${ID}.fam --extract snps.txt
--recode vcf-iid --out output${indiv}chr${ID}vcf --keep-fam individual1.txt

plink --bed chr${ID}.bed --bim chr${ID}.bim --fam chr${ID}.fam --extract snps.txt
--recode vcf-iid --out output${indiv}chr${ID}vcf --keep-fam individual2.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Happy coding. Also here is a link with some useful information on Python File I/O <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/python_files_io.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/python_files_io.htm</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">In bash, what you want is <code>for x in seq 1 500; do plink [..] individual$x.txt; done</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BaileyParker you missed the backtick, or more likely SO swallowed them...  you need "for x in `seq 1 500`; ...".   How do you put literal backticks inside a backticked expection in SO anyway?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for this. It hasn't seemed to work, may be because with this I am just trying to solve one piece of a problem which I've also asked about here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55186485/how-to-code-for-iterating-through-multiple-files-in-linux" title="how to code for iterating through multiple files in linux">stackoverflow.com/questions/55186485/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@joanis I did. You can escape them with a backslash, I believe. <code>for x in `seq 1 500`; do plink [..] individual$x.txt; done</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BaileyParker Sure enough, it worked. It didn't seem to work in the answer box, but it worked in the comment box. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked thank you! Thank also for the link too!</span>
