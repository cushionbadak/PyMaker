<p>Does any of the ML algorithms have a 'forecast' function where you can forecast a time series, say 10 days ahead, 20 days ahead, etc.? All you have is prediction, that is, how close prediction is to a test set. I'm not looking for that. I am very familiar with that.</p>
<p>Just as you can use ARIMA, ARMA, ARIMAX, etc to forecast 'h' days (10,20,30,etc) ahead, can one use any of the popular ML algorithms (XGBoost, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, SVR, ANN, LSTM, etc) to forecast a time series, say 10 days in the future. </p>
<p>There are tons of predictions using ML but I have NOT found any model used in forecasting, say 10 days ahead. Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Yes you are right, most of machine learning algorithms is a regression model where the model are predicting (target variable) with the existence of predictors (x variables).</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a ways to forecast ahead, by creating multi-step forecasting and do some time shifting on the target variable. In this case, your predictors are the time shifted of the target variable. For instance,</p>
<h2><strong>Recursive Multi-step Forecast Strategy</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>prediction(t+1) = model(obs(t-1), obs(t-2), ..., obs(t-n))</li>
<li>prediction(t+2) = model(prediction(t+1), obs(t-1), ..., obs(t-n-1))</li>
</ul>
<p>where you take your prediction as input to predict the next time. </p>
<p>There are several strategy for multi-step forecast. For further reading, you can read this good article :</p>
