<p>Very new to programming even newer to asking on stackoverflow so apologies if badly worded and/or formatted.</p>
<p>I'm using Python 3.7.2 on Windows 10.
I'm trying to make .bat files so I can execute my python code without having to go into IDLE.</p>
<p>My python code is    </p>
<pre><code>#! python
import webbrowser
webbrowser.open('https://killsixbilliondemons.com/')
</code></pre>
<p>and the .bat file reads</p>
<pre><code>@ C:\Program Files (x86)\Python37-32\python.exe C:\Users\User\Desktop\Codes\PROGS\mapIt.py
</code></pre>
<p>When I run it a command prompt window momentarily opens then closes but nothing happens in my browser. What's going wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The line <code>import webrowser</code> contains a typo, it should be <code>import webbrowser</code>. Fixing that line should fix your issue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you want to see the output of a <code>.bat</code> file, try running it from a pre-made <code>cmd</code> prompt by hitting <code>windows + r</code>, entering <code>cmd</code> in the prompt that appears, going to the directory the <code>.bat</code> file is in through the <code>cd &lt;FULLPATH&gt;</code> command and calling it through <code>&lt;NAMEOFBATFILE&gt;.bat</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<ul>
<li>You need to add a pause to your bat file to see any output of the code.</li>
<li>Also, Surround your parts of code with Quotation marks whenever there are spaces in command or parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>So your bat file content should read.</p>
<pre><code>@ "C:\Program Files (x86)\Python37-32\python.exe" "C:\Users\User\Desktop\Codes\PROGS\mapIt.py"   
pause
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to fix errors (if any) in the Python code.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">If anyone else is experiencing this problem I also needed to close the file paths in the .bat in  double quotes "" so cmd could parse the white space characters</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, for clarity, my issue was not that I don't see what happens in the comand prompt that appears but that the code in the .py file didn't seem to be executing</span>
