<p>I am new to Python and therefore I am struggling to resolve the following problem. I installed <em>pip</em> and I made a user installation of <em>pipenv</em> and then on my project folder I run the command: </p>
<pre><code>pipenv install requests
</code></pre>
<p>which gives me an error saying that the <em>pipenv command either wrong or cannot be found</em>.</p>
<p>I added following path on my system environment variables the :</p>
<pre><code>C:\Users\andri\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\Scripts
</code></pre>
<p>but still it does not work. Does anyone have an idea as to what I should do next in order to fix this? Thanks in advance</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>My operating system is Windows.</p>
<p>Here is how I installed pip through cmd</p>
<pre><code>
C:\Users\andri&gt;python -m pip install -U pip

<p>You will need to add that directory</p>

<p>to your PATH environment variable; there are many ways to do it, see e.g. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9546324/adding-directory-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows/9546345">Adding directory to PATH Environment Variable in Windows</a> </p>
<p>Another option is to just always use</p>
<pre><code>C:\...&gt; C:\Users\andri\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\Scripts\pipenv install

<p>but I think that might get a little stale quickly.</p>

<p>There is your answer. The <code>Scripts</code> directory with utility scripts for packages installed per-user is not on <code>PATH</code>, so your command shell won't find them unless you add it.</p>
<p>If you have <em>just</em> added it to <code>PATH</code> via the Control Panel, see <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/107521/why-are-changes-to-my-path-not-being-recognised">windows - Why are changes to my PATH not being recognised? - Super User</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you install it through? Sudo ? It happens sometimes because it needs to be installed that way so it would be sudo pip install pipenv or if that doesn't work try this one sudo -H pip install -U pipenv . Also do you have virtualenv or another virtual environment the two could be conflicting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hey thanks for the answer! I am using windows, is the sudo command still gonna work here? I get an error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please include <a href="/help/mcve">the exact command(s) you are running, and the exact output, from a "clean state",  and environment details where applicable</a>. E.g. any virtualenvs involved? What OS? How did you install <code>pip</code> and <code>pipenv</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One more: where is your Python installation and is it on <code>PATH</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So after you installed pipenv you tried pipenv install requests.... What is the output of the following: pipenv --python 3.7 . Also have you checked the GitHub for pipenv it is linked <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/pypa/pipenv</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the answer! As I have written on my question, I have already done this step. Hence, the path is already added on the variables</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try opening a new Command Prompt then. Sometimes path changes don't get directly applied.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But I added this on the path as mentioned in my question</span>
