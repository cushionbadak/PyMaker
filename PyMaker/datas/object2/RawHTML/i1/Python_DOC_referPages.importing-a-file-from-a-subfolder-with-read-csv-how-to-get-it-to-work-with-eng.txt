<p>I am trying to use pandas to read a csv file which is in a sunfolder of the current folder. I am on a Windows PC.</p>
<p>If I run:</p>
<pre><code>df=pd.read_csv("subfolder//file.csv") 
</code></pre>
<p>I get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xb2 in position
  16: invalid start byte</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I run:</p>
<pre><code>df=pd.read_csv("subfolder//file.csv", engine='python')
</code></pre>
<p>It works.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Why????</p></li>
<li><p>Isn't there a way to use c as the engine? It's meant to be faster</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This might be because read_csv is trying to read the file in "UTF-8" format while your file is clearly in a different format. To detect the encoding in Windows, you can look at this.
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3710374/get-encoding-of-a-file-in-windows">Get encoding of a file in Windows</a></p>
<p>After you found out the file's encoding format, you can give an argument of the encoding type to the read_csv function. e.g.</p>
<pre><code>df=pd.read_csv("subfolder//file.csv", encoding="utf-8") 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you csv file contain a SUPERSCRIPT TWO character U+00B2 <code>²</code>? If the answer is yes, it is probably Latin1 or cp1252 encoded...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So this means that engine='c' causes encoding to default to 'utf-8', while engine='python' means a different encoding? I double checked <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/…</a> and none of this seems to be documented explicitly - as is unfortunately all too common in the beautiful world of Python...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Pythonistaanonymous I don't know about the current situation explicitly, but the error you are getting is an error of encoding conflict, and I suspect this might be the case. Have you checked your file's encoding yet?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, if I set encoding='latin1' it works. Thanks for the help. PS still frustrated at the how much documentation sucks in the world of Python!</span>
