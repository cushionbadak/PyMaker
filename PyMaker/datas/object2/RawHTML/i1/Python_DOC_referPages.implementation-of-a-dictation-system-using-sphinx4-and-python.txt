<p>I want to develop a dictation system using Sphinx4. After some search, I realize that the language that it's better to use is Java. Can I combine Sphinx4 with Python? I prefer Python because I want to enhance my system by adding neural network techniques in the language model and apply domain classification. Also, I read about pocket-sphinx and pypi but pocket-sphinx is said to be for portable lightweight applications while my application will run on the cloud and I will have enough computing power to support a better model.</p>

<p>For cloud applications it's better to use something like <a href="https://github.com/alumae/kaldi-gstreamer-server" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/alumae/kaldi-gstreamer-server</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I know and thanks for the suggestion! Unfortunately, it is asked that Sphinx should be used and I wanted to write Python and avoid Java.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This thing is exactly in Python</span>
