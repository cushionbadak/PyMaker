<p>I don't understand how indexing of a numpy ndarray works, when using a custom class instance as the index.</p>
<p>I have the following code:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

class MyClass:
    def __index__(self):
        return 1,2

foo = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
bar = MyClass()

print(foo[1,2])
print(foo[bar])
</code></pre>
<p>I expect to get the same result (6) from both print functions. But from the second one, where the class instance is used a the index, I receive an error:</p>
<pre><code>IndexError: only integers, slices (`:`), ellipsis (`...`), numpy.newaxis (`None`) and integer or boolean arrays are valid indices
</code></pre>
<p>If I call the __index__ method explicitly with</p>
<pre><code>print(foo[bar.__index__()])
</code></pre>
<p>it works. But this defeats the purpose of the magic method.</p>
<p>If I call the array with just one index, everything works fine:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

class MyClass:
    def __index__(self):
        return 1

foo = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
bar = MyClass()

print(foo[1])
print(foo[bar])

&gt;&gt;&gt; [4 5 6]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [4 5 6]
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>So what I don't get:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ndarray can use the output of the __index__ method for multiple dimensions. Seen when calling it explicitly.</li>
<li>The ndarray does coll the __index__ method. Seen in the second example.</li>
<li>But for some reason, this does not work at the same time. Why?</li>
</ul>
<p>Did I miss something, or does the ndarray not support this kind of indexing?</p>
<hr/>
<p>I just want to add, that it apparently doesn't matter, how the __index__ method outputs its result. I tried:</p>
<pre><code>return a, b
return (a, b)
return tuple((a, b))
</code></pre>
<p>None of them worked for me.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As mentioned <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__index__" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>, <code>__index__</code> method <code>Must return an integer.</code></p>
<p>That's why your attempt didn't work, while the "one index" example worked.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Implementing <code>__index__</code> means "my object represents an integer, and the return value of <code>__index__</code> is the integer it represents". It doesn't mean whatever you seem to think it means.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah ok, so in my case my object represents a coordinate in 2D space, very similar to a normal Vector. I now wanted to use this object to get a specific element of an ndarray.I thought that the this is the right way. But can this only be used for single integers, not for multiple ones?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I didn't know, that <code>__index__</code> must return an integer to work at all. Because a ndarray can handle multiple indexes, and the method can be called explicitly, I hoped these two could be combined. Would be very handy in my opinion. But ok.</span>
