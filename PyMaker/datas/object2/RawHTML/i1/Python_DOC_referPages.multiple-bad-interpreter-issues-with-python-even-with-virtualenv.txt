<p>I am on mac (mojave osx 10.14) and admittedly I have a pretty messed up python environment. </p>
<p>Recently I have been getting multiple errors such as:</p>
<pre><code>zsh: /usr/local/bin/pip: bad interpreter: /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.6: no such file or directory

zsh: /usr/local/bin/alembic: bad interpreter: /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.6: no such file or directory

zsh: /usr/local/bin/pytest: bad interpreter: /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.6: no such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p>This is the case even with creating and entering a virtualenv to work inside of.</p>
<p>In this specific case, I need a python3 virtual env.</p>
<p>When I <code>which python</code> outside the environment, I get <code>/usr/local/bin/python</code> and <code>python -v</code> = <code>Python 2.7.15</code></p>
<p>Outside this virtualenv, I get these bad interpreter errors. </p>
<p>I create a virtualenv for python3 with <code>virtualenv -p python3 .venv</code></p>
<p>Without even installing anything, I still get </p>
<pre><code>zsh: /usr/local/bin/alembic: bad interpreter: /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.6: no such file or directory

zsh: /usr/local/bin/pytest: bad interpreter: /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.6: no such file or directory
</code></pre>
<p>If I <code>pip uninstall alembic</code> and <code>pip3 uninstall alembic</code>, I get the bad interpreter error still.</p>
<p>I have no idea where it might still be installed and not sure where to start on how to clean up my environment. Would like a fresh start but I don't know if that's possible.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have removed (uninstalled) <code>/usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.6</code> and the interpreter is used as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shebang</a> in <code>/usr/local/bin/alembic</code>, <code>/usr/local/bin/pytest</code> and perhaps other scripts. The best way to fix them is to reinstall them with a different interpreter. For example:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/python3.6 -m pip install -U alembic pip pytest
</code></pre>
<p><code>/usr/bin/python3.6</code> is only an example here.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you're right, those files have that shebang. But, I thought if I'm working in a virtualenv, it would not be referencing those. Is there a proper way to do this to override what is in /usr/local/bin? If I specifically python3 -m pip install alembic... in the virtualenv it still gives me the same errors</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have to install copies of these modules into the virtualenv. Then you use the scripts from <code>venv/bin/</code> instead of <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>.</span>
