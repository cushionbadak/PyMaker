<p>I've inherited some code and was curious as why it is being used and how it works. The code is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>strsql: str = sql.SWAP_SQL.format(*sql_clauses)
</code></pre>
<p>No issue with the right hand side of the assignment, it's simply passing paramaters  to a sql string. I'm curious as to the <code>strSQL: str =</code> portion. What exactly is this doing as <code>sql.SWAP_SQL.format(*sql_clauses)</code> and <code>strsql</code> appear to have the exact same sql string?</p>

<p>Python 3 (i think .5 but maybe earlier) introduced type hints for methods and variables. The hints do not <a href="https://pypi.org/project/enforce/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enforce</a> the types (you can but not by default), they are there mostly for readability (basically just hinting the proper format).</p>

<p>That is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">type hint</a>. It's hinting that the type of <code>strsql</code> is a <code>str</code>.</p>
