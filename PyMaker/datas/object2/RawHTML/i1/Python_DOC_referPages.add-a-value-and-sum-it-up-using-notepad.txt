<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am having a file wherein the data is similar as given below:</p>
<pre><code>abc - $0.05
xyz - $0.01
rst - $0.09
etc - $0.4
</code></pre>
<p>What I want to do is, increment all the values by $0.02 so that the final sum will look like below:</p>
<pre><code>abc - $0.07
xyz - $0.12
rst - $0.11
etc - $0.42
</code></pre>
<p>How can I achieve this using Notepad++</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can run a python script within the PythonScript plugin.</p>
<p>If it is not yet installed, follow this <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/community/topic/17256/guide-how-to-install-the-pythonscript-plugin-on-notepad-7-6-3-7-6-4-and-above" rel="nofollow noreferrer">guide</a></p>
<p>Create a script (Plugins &gt;&gt; PythonScript &gt;&gt; New Script)</p>
<p>Copy this code and save the file (for example <code>calculate.py</code>):</p>
<pre><code>import re
def calculate(match):
    return '%s' % (str(float(match.group(1)) + 0.02))

editor.rereplace('(\d+\.\d+)', calculate)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Open the file you want to change</li>
<li>Run the script (Plugins &gt;&gt; PythonScript &gt;&gt; Scripts &gt;&gt; calculate)</li>
<li>Done</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Result for given example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>abc - $0.07
xyz - $0.03
rst - $0.11
etc - $0.42
</code></pre>
<p>Note the difference from your expected second line (<code>xyz - $0.01</code> becomes <code>xyz - $0.03</code> and not <code>xyz - $0.12</code>)</p>
