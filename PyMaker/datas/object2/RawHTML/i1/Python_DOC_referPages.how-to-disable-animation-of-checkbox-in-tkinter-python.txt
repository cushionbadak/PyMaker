<p>It is the default <code>activebackground</code> shade(#ececec) of a <code>CheckButton</code> in tkinter.</p>
<p>You can change it to match your background, while creating the <code>CheckButton</code> or later as well.</p>
<pre><code>cb = CheckButton(root, activebackground='grey')
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>cb = CheckButton(root)
cb.config(activebackground='grey')
</code></pre>
<p>PS: Looks like you are adding extra label next to your <code>CheckButton</code> to show some text related to it, but if you need the text for your <code>CheckButton</code> then there is another attribute of <code>CheckButton</code> called <code>text</code> which can do the same job for you.</p>
