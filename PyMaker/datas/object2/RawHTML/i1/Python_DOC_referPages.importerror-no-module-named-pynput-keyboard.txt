<p>I have a problem and I can't find anything to help.The idea is that I can't import pynput. I did the pip install and this is what it shows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "sb.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    from pynput.keyboard import Key, Controller
  ImportError: No module named pynput.keyboard
</code></pre>
<p>I tried again pip install pynput and it shows</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Requirement already satisfied</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the code, i don't know if it helps but there you go:</p>
<pre><code>from pynput.keyboard import Key, Controller
def game():
    keyboard = Controller()
    if key.press():
        s = Sound()
        s.read("Cymatics - Guitar Chord Loop 2 - 128 BPM Dmaj")
        s.play()

print "Welcome to soundboard"
print "You will see a list of sound names, just write the name of it"
print "If you want to stop it type stop"
print "Type start"

start = input()
if start.lower() == "start":
    while True:
        game()
else:
    print "Ups, try again.."
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>How are you running the file? When you do python3 nameofyourprogram.py you should use pip3 install pynput</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Last time I had this issue, it was because I had installed the module using pip for a given version of python (lets say 2.7), but I was running my script using python 3.6.
Try to check the versions.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you using python 2 or 3 ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am using 2.7.10</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank so you, that was the problem.I am a beginner and I didn't knew that, I used pip3 to install it.Thanks again!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">python --version says Python 2.7.10, I don't know how to check the module version</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>pip pynput | grep lxml</code> should do the trick.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you did <code>pip install pynput</code>, you can check on which python it is installing it using <code>pip --version</code>.</span>
