<p>am getting failures importing the JSON file from the folder, I have tried the convention:</p>
<pre><code>from web_scraper import data
</code></pre>
<p>and also</p>
<pre><code>from web_scraper.data import *
</code></pre>
<p>and both didn't work out.
Also, how do I return the JSON file fetched? Is my method</p>
<pre><code>return jsonify(bank_list)
</code></pre>
<p>the correct one?
Here is the snapshot gotten from my PC<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o2byA.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="Python-Flask" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o2byA.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>Your import is wrong. 
First of all, you cannot import JSON in python. Only python files.</p>
<p>If it would be a python file, you'd have to use <code>from ..web_scraper import data</code>, as it's in the parent directory (assuming you didn't modify the pythonpath).</p>
<p>To load JSON, you can use the built-in json module.</p>
<pre><code>import json
import os

with open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "web_scraper", "data.json")) as file:
    data = json.load(file)
# data is a dictionary that you can use in jsonify just fine
</code></pre>
<p>This would load the file's content and parse the JSON for later use, e.g. in <code>jsonify</code>. It's a normal dictionary</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I have tried <code>j = os.path.join(os.path.dirname( 	os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'data.json') data = json.load(j) 		return jsonify(data) </code> resulting in "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'read'"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Jens, I am getting real close to it. However, it responded with syntax error <code>with open(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "web_scraper", "data.json") as file:</code> the arrow was pointing towards the "as" word. Any clues why?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My bad, add another closing <code>)</code> ;) - I updated the snippet</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the heads up, couldn't notice that XD thank you very much.</span>
