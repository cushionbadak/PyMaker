<p>I have a data frame with one column as an array of strings and the 2nd column as one string value.</p>
<pre><code>a = pd.Series([["a","b","c", "d"],["a","b","c", "d"],["a","b","c", "d"],["a","b","c", "d"],["a","b","c", "d"]])

b = pd.Series(["a","d","e", "c", "b"])
</code></pre>
<p>i wish to check whether b is contained in a, but i am receiving an error when running the isin function.</p>
<pre><code>b.isin(a)
</code></pre>
<p>Any solution to this. i was particularly trying to avoid loops here, not sure if that was a good strategy based on run time.</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<pre><code>**a                          b**
["a","b","c", "d"]           a
["a","b","c", "d"]           d
["a","b","c", "d"]           e
["a","b","c", "d"]           c
["a","b","c", "d"]           b

<p><code>pandas.Series</code> implements the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.combine.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">combine</a> method which you could use in the following way to find the elements in <code>b</code> that also appear in the <code>a</code> lists:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

a = pd.Series([["a","b","c", "d"],["a","b","c", "d"],["a","b","c", "d"],["a","b","c", "d"],["a","b","c", "d"]])

<span class="comment-copy">What is the intended output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am not sure about efficiency, but <code>any(map(lambda x: x == b.tolist(), a))</code> should work;</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edited the post to include the desired output. thanks for pointing that out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>b</code> has 5 strings in the series but each of the rows in <code>a</code> has only 4 elements. Also, all the rows in <code>a</code> are identical. Could you say why you would expect <code>b</code> to match the first two and last two rows but not the middle row?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah! I see what you mean now with the latest edit. Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for sharing a method which works without using loops.</span>
