<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm setting up multiple views (tree, form) of a model.</p>
<p>I have two tree views and form views where I need to open Tree 2 view as record. </p>
<p>When clicking tree 2 record then open Form 2 as detail page.
Currently I have set Tree view sequence 1 working but still opening Form 1 instead of Form2. </p>
<p>How I can do this?</p>

<p>If you want to specify the views to use, you can add a <code>context</code> attribute, and specify a view id for each type of view supported, exactly like the action's <code>view_id</code> attribute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;field name="order_line" colspan="4" nolabel="1" context="{'form_view_ref' : 'module.view_id', 'tree_view_ref' : 'model.view_id'}"/&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't specify the views, OpenERP will choose one in this order :</p>
<ul>
<li>It will use the &lt;form&gt; or &lt;tree&gt; view defined inside the field (see below)</li>
<li>Else, it will use the views with the highest priority for this object.</li>
<li>Finally, it will generate default empty views, with all fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The context keys are named <code>&lt;view_type&gt;_view_ref</code>.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>By default, OpenERP will never use a view that is not defined for your object. If you have two models, with the same fields, but a different model name, OpenERP will never use the view of one for the other, even if one model inherit another.</p>
<p>You can force this by manually specifying the view, either in the action or in the context.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you add more details? Adding the code of the views for example</span>
