<p>I was trying Visual Studio Code that comes with Anaconda</p>
<p>There was heaps of problems that I could not get a simple python code to run successfully there</p>
<p>but on the other hand there was some really nice features
beside the autocomplete feature that I liked</p>
<p>Using the standard plotting</p>
<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(df['Col1'], df['Col2'])
</code></pre>
<p>there was the Figure which gives you many options to do with the graph including zoom in, change access and many more.</p>

<p>is there something similar or any other way that can give me same Figure feature in VSCode?</p>

<p>Make sure you select an Anaconda environment and then if you use the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Jupyter support</a> you can get the plots shown in the interactive window.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So how did you get this nice Figure? I've never touched VSCode in any form, but I keep getting figures of similar properties from <code>matplotlib</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I got it using import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.scatter(df['Col1'], df['Col2']) but when I apply same code in Anaconda I just get an image of the graph, no interaction.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want to code python with anaconda an visual studio code? That code is executed in Anaconda command prompt, as I understand.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how can i select Anaconda environment??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@asmgx make sure to create an Anaconda environment w/ a specified Python version and then you can <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_select-a-python-interpreter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">follow the docs for selecting an interpreter</a>.</span>
