<p>I am trying to load a .dat file (RML2016_10b.dat) radio dataset from <a href="https://www.deepsig.io/datasets" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DeepSig</a> using <code>_pickle</code> in Python 3.6 as follows:</p>
<pre><code>from _pickle import load, dump
Xd = load(open("RML2016_10b.dat", 'rb'))
</code></pre>
<p>But I keep getting the following error:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/anoir/PycharmProjects/AMC/classification.py", line 14, in &lt;module&gt;
    Xd = load(open("RML2016_10b.dat", 'rb'))
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xde in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone give me a solution?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Might be the case that the file was created with python2. Try this answer: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28218466/unpickling-a-python-2-object-with-python-3" title="unpickling a python 2 object with python 3">stackoverflow.com/questions/28218466/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes but i cannot use python 2 because i have to use tensorflow which does not work with python 2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Read the answer: d = pickle.load(f, encoding='latin1')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes i am trying it now ... i just  wanted to explain</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't need to explicitly <code>import _pickle</code> in Python 3. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19191859/what-difference-between-pickle-and-pickle-in-python-3">What difference between pickle and _pickle in python 3?</a></span>
