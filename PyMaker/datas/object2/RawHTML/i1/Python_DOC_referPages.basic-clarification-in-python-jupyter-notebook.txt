<p>How to print the value of 'a' and 'b' in the     output instead of variable using formatting?</p>
<pre><code>a = 1
b = 2
c = a+b
OUTPUT  = Sum of 1 and 2  = 3
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>does this solve your problem, please run the below:</p>
<pre><code>a = 1
b = 2
c = a+b

print("The sum of", a,"and", b,"=",c)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>The sum of 1 and 2 = 3
</code></pre>

print("Sum of",a,"and",b,"=",c)

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you use Python &gt;3.6 you could use f-strings instead. They are much more readable:</p>
<pre><code>a = 1
b = 2
c = a+b
print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} = {c}")
</code></pre>
<p>The Output would be:</p>
<pre><code>The sum of 1 and 2 = 3
</code></pre>
