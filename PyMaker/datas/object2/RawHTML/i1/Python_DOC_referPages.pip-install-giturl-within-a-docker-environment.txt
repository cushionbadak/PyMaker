<p>I am using this Docker (FROM lambci/lambda:python3.6) and I need to install a private repository package. The problem is the Docker does not have git and I can not install git using apt-get or apk install because the Docker is not Linux.</p>
<p>Is there any possible way to fix this installing git? Or is there any other better method I could use to install this private repository package?</p>

<p>add this to makefile:</p>
<pre><code># makefile
git clone REPO
cd REPO_DIR; python setup.py bdist_wheel
cp REPO_DIR/dist/* .
rm -rf REPO_DIR/
</code></pre>
<p>add this to dockerfile:</p>
<pre><code># dockerfile
RUN pip install REPO*.whl
</code></pre>
<p>and then the package is successfully installed within docker</p>

<p>can you <code>pip install</code> the git repo next to your source code and mount it together with your code into the container?</p>
<pre><code>cd WORKING_DIRECTORY
pip install --target ./ GIT_URL

<span class="comment-copy">I am basically using this repo (github.com/21Buttons/pychromeless), to do this you are suggesting I would have to <code>pip install --target ./src GIT_URL</code> ? And then the rest should work fine?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried to to this <code>pip install --target ./src GIT_URL</code> and it does not work. It can't find the dependencies of the repository when importing it. Is there any way to pip install into a file then using this file to later pip install using this file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">With <code>--target</code> you can tell python where to place the files it installs. Then you can mount them into your container yourself.</span>
