<p>What does the <code>%s</code> do here at the end of the chrome_path variable? Without it the function can "not locate runnable browser"</p>
<pre><code>import webbrowser as wb
chrome_path = "C:/Program Files (x86)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe %s"
url = "www.google.com"
wb.get(chrome_path).open(url)
</code></pre>

<p>If you trace through <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2.7/Lib/webbrowser.py#L35" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the source code</a> it looks like the library can run in two ways here; <code>wb.get()</code> expects either a browser name or a shell command with a <code>%s</code> placeholder. </p>
<p>The browser name can be a human readable name that is configured elsewhere.</p>
<p>Accepting a shell command allows more complicated commands, or for the use of browsers not recognised by the library.</p>
<p>If you give a shell command, the <code>url</code> given when you call <code>.open(url)</code> is substituted for the <code>%s</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The URL (well, it's not really a URL) is substituted in in place of the <code>%s</code> placeholder, making a command line that will open the URL in the browser.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did read about this substitution on that post but I don't understand what the placeholder is for</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, if you were going to open a Web site in Chrome from the command line, you would type e.g. <code>chrome http://www.google.com/</code> right? Clearly <code>webbrowser</code> is putting together a command line of this sort.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the effort and clarification I understand now that the url is substituted into the %s. Thanks</span>
