<p>I need to implement Lasso and Ridge Regression and calculate hyperparameters by means of cross-validation.
I found the code that does it, but I cannot quite understand it.    </p>
<pre><code>lassocv = LassoCV(alphas=None, cv=15, max_iter=100000, normalize=True)
lassocv.fit(X_train, y_train)
lasso = Lasso(alpha=lassocv.alpha_, normalize=True)
lasso.fit(X_train, y_train)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_val, lasso.predict(X_val)))

ridgecv = RidgeCV(alphas=alphas, normalize=True)
ridgecv.fit(X_train, y_train)
ridge = Ridge(alpha=ridgecv.alpha_, normalize=True)
ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_val, ridge.predict(X_val)))
</code></pre>
<p>So, why alphas=alphas in RidgeCV? If I write alphas=None, an error occurs. Why is it not necessary to write cv for ridgecv?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think the answer is related to the way the strength of regularization has been set on the different models.</p>
<p>In RidgeCV, you need to declare <code>alpha</code>s explicitly because the parameter tuning is not  done on the basis of the error calculated from cross-validation. </p>
<p>In LassoCV however, they have a way of automatically calculating <code>alpha</code>s from the CV error. However, if you want to set them explicitly, you can do so by changing the optional parameters: <code>n_alpha</code> and <code>alphas</code></p>
