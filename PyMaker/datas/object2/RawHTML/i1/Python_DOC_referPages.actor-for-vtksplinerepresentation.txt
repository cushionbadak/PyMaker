<p>I have two <em>vtkSplineRepresentation ()</em> and two viewports. I want to bound a view with a Spline. I know that in order to do this I have to create an Actor. But the problem is that I do not know how. I tried the VtkActor command but I only show a ball, not a set of points, I also tried LineActor but I got an error. Can anybody help me?</p>

<p>You need to get the polydata from your vtkSplineRepresenatation (through GetPolyData()) and pass it to a vtkPolyDataMapper, then use the vtkPolyDataMapper to your actor. You did not post code so there's nothing I can't fix, but to give you an idea:</p>
<pre><code>mapper = vtk.vtkPolyDataMapper()
mapper.SetInputData(spline.GetPolyData())
mapper.Update()

actor = vtk.vtkActor()
actor.SetMapper(mapper)
</code></pre>
