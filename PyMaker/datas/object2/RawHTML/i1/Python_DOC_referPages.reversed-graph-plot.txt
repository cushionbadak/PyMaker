<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was trying to plot a graph using Python's matplotlib. The data that I wanted to plot is this
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OP6f.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="the data" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8OP6f.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm trying to plot <code>y_i</code> with respect to <code>t</code> (<code>t</code> the x axis and <code>y_i</code> the y axis), but somehow I ended up with this graph,
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DnQOA.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="graph image here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DnQOA.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can see that there is something wrong with it, and we all know it (as we go higher along the y axis, the number is getting lower instead of higher). The graph is supposed to have negative slope, how do I fix this? (All kind of help will be appreciated)</p>
<p>Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

e = 2.71828183
k = -0.043594
C = 100
h = 5

def y(t):
    y = C*(e**(k*t))
    return y

def f(Y):
    f = k*Y
    return f

def y_i(Y, F):
    y_i = Y + h*F
    return y_i

#Y = y(x)    
#F = f(Y)
data_luruh = {}
data_luruh['t'] = [x for x in range(0, 101, 5)]
data_luruh['y'] = [y(x) for x in range(0, 101, 5)]
data_luruh['y_i'] = [0 for x in range(0, 101, 5)]
data_luruh['g'] = [0 for x in range(0, 101, 5)]

data_luruh['y_i'][0] = 'NA'
data_luruh['g'][0] = 'NA'

a = 1
while a &lt;= 20:
    data_luruh['y_i'][a] = y_i(y((a-1)*5), f(y((a-1)*5)))
    data_luruh['g'][a] = data_luruh['y'][a] - data_luruh['y_i'][a]
    a += 1

df = pd.DataFrame(data=data_luruh)
print(df)

t_data = data_luruh['t']
y_data = data_luruh['y']
yi_data = data_luruh['y_i']

plt.xlabel('t')
plt.plot(data_luruh['y_i'], 'go')
plt.show()

<p>If you add NA as a string, the whole data column will be treated as an <code>object</code> (the numpy type for strings) column. Thus, the y-column will be sorted lexicographically. </p>
<p>Instead, use <code>np.nan</code>, which internally is treated like a number: </p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

data_luruh['y_i'][0] = np.nan
data_luruh['g'][0] = np.nan
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Don't use <code>"NA"</code> for missing values: it's a string and will lead to the other values being interpreted as a string as well. Instead, changing the lines to</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
data_luruh['y_i'][0] = np.nan
data_luruh['g'][0] = np.nan
</code></pre>
