<p>Can one make Altair plots fit the screen size, rather than have a pixel-defined width and height? I've read things about <code>autosize</code> <code>"fit"</code>, but I am unsure about where to specify these.</p>

<p>There is no way to do this. The dimensions of Altair/Vega-Lite charts are pre-determined by the chart specification and data, and cannot be made to scale with the size of the browser window.</p>
