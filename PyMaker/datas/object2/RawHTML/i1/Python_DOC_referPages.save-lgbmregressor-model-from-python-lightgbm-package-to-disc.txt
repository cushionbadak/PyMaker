<p>Hi I am unable to find an way to save and reuse an LGBM model to a file. I used python package lightgbm and LGBMRegressor model. Could you please help? Documentations doesn't seem to have useful information. I am using python 3.5 on Spyder </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try:</p>
<pre><code>my_model.booster_.save_model('mode.txt')
#load from model:

bst = lgb.Booster(model_file='mode.txt')
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use pickle:</p>
<pre><code>from sklearn.externals import joblib
# save model
joblib.dump(my_model, 'lgb.pkl')
# load model
gbm_pickle = joblib.load('lgb.pkl')
</code></pre>
<p>Let me know if that helps</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried so far?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">save_model, save, Save, Save_Model</span>
<span class="comment-copy">eg, my_model.save_model(path)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Error: AttributeError: 'LGBMRegressor' object has no attribute 'save_model'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you share how you imported and trained your model? It appears that model.save_model('model.txt') should work!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your Answer, it helped....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you please let me know if there is any way to get the feature list in the model after loading using lgb.Booster (the bst model in your example)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have not worked much with lgb. Can you write another question here in SO? I believe that is a good question that I am interested to know too.</span>
