<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I have a GUI that will size itself to the appropriate proportions dependent on the size of the display. It then needs to divide itself <strong>evenly</strong> into 160,000 cells by having its columnspan=400 and rowspan=400.</p>
<p>I have specific widgets that need to be in specific cells, and some of the cells need to be empty, but the GUI just collapses all of the empty cells. </p>
<p>This code is intended to make the label (background) be near the bottom of the page, but it appears a the top left because its crushing all of the empty rows.</p>
<p>Is my only answer to this to use empty frames to take up space?</p>
<pre><code>import tkinter as Tk

root= Tk.Tk()


def window(main):
    main.title('Bible Helper')
    width= int(main.winfo_screenwidth()*0.5)
    height= int(main.winfo_screenheight()*0.75)
    x= (main.winfo_screenwidth()//2)- (width // 2)
    y= (main.winfo_screenheight()//2)- (height//2)-20
    main.geometry('%sx%s+%s+%s' % (width, height, x, y))
    root.update_idletasks()


window(root)


root_frame = Tk.Frame(root, width=root.winfo_width(), height=root.winfo_height(), bg="black")
root_frame.grid_propagate(0) #Stops child widgets of root_frame from resizing it
root_frame.grid(row=0, column=0, rowspan=400, columnspan=400)


background= Tk.Label(root_frame, text="BH", font=("Arial", 100, "bold"), background ="black", anchor="se", padx=35, pady=15, foreground= 'white')
background.grid(row=306, rowspan=94, sticky="NWSE")


root.mainloop()

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I figured it out, it was just a simple mistake on my end of making the parent widget the frame instead of root.</p>
</div>
