<p>New to Django.</p>
<p>I'm trying to customize the change_form.html template right now. However, Django is simply refusing to load the local one I have created.</p>
<p>My app is listed in INSTALLED_APPS. APP_DIRS is set to True. I even hardcoded an absolute path to a base directory templates folder. At this point I literally have templates in every single possible folder and location Django would look for custom templates overrides. If I alter the base template my change_form and change_list do update. What am I missing here?</p>
<pre><code>INSTALLED_APPS = [
'quizzes', # my app
'django.contrib.admin',
#snip


TEMPLATES = [

{
    'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
    'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],
    'APP_DIRS': True,
    'OPTIONS': {
</code></pre>
<p>Locations I have the templates already:</p>
<p>/templates (at the same level as manage.py)</p>
<p>/templates/quiz</p>
<p>/templates/quizzes</p>
<p>/online_training/templates (the main project folder)</p>
<p>/quizzes/templates (main app folder)</p>
<p>/quizzes/templates/quiz</p>
<p>/quizzes/templates/quizzes</p>
<p>/quizzes/admin</p>
<p>/quizzes/admin/templates</p>
<p>/quizzes/admin/quizzes</p>
<p>/quizzes/admin/quiz</p>
<p>I'm trying the shotgun approach here, and either I completely missed the correct folder to put this stuff in, or something is jacked.</p>

<p>Try creating this structure (in your project root directory):</p>
<p>templates/admin/quizzes/yourmodelname/change_form.html</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you are running Django with Apache or other server, try restarting it, because many times templates are cached.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Its running on the dev django server only. Which has been stopped/started.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Finally! I figured I must be missing the actual appropriate directory, but I spent so much time going crosseyed looking for the right one, I missed it.  This worked, thanks!</span>
