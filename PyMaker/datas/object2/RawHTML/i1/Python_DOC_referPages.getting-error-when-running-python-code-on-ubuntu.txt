<p>This is my first time to use Ubuntu </p>
<p>I am using Spyder</p>
<p>I am following instructions I find on the ineternet</p>
<p>Now I am stuck</p>
<p>I am trying to get Python Anaconda working on Ubuntu</p>
<p>I installed it</p>
<p>trying now to test my first code</p>
<p>simple code </p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import quandl

df = quandl.get("WIKI/GOOGL")

print(df.head())
</code></pre>
<p>but I get <code>ModuleNotFoundError : No Module named pandas</code></p>
<p>I have installed panadas in both ways</p>
<pre><code>conda install -c anaconda pandas
</code></pre>
<p>and </p>
<pre><code>pip3 install pandas
</code></pre>
<p>both ways installed</p>
<p>yet I am still getting same error</p>
<pre><code>ModuleNotFoundError : No Module named pandas
</code></pre>

<p>In this instance, it appears that all you needed to was restart the kernel. When you install a new package, if you are using ipython, jupyternotebook, or spyder you should restart the kernel. This is why <code>python -c "import pandas"</code> worked, whereas in your python session, it wasn't working.</p>
<p>A running python kernel does not search for new packages since it started running. Starting and stopping will make sure it will find the new packages. There are probably ways to find new packages without restarting the kernel, probably by using some of <code>importlab</code> functions, but not sure if this would be necessary.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the outcome when you run <code>pip3 install pandas</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Similarly, what is the outcome if you run <code>python -c "import pandas"</code></span>

<span class="comment-copy">There is nothing in the question to suggest that the OP is using Jupyter. Do you have information we don't have?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">True, it might not be jupyter. perhaps @asmgx can clarify. Will delete/edit answer if updated</span>
