<p>In a tutorial, I read that that there is a difference between <code>input</code> and <code>raw_input</code>. I discovered that they changed the behavior of these functions in the Python 3.0. What is the new behavior?</p>
<p>And why in the python console interpreter this</p>
<pre><code>x = input()
</code></pre>
<p>Sends an error but if I put it in a file.py and run it, it does not?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In python 2.x, <code>raw_input()</code> returns a string and <code>input()</code> evaluates the input in the execution context in which it is called</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = input()
"hello"
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = input()
x + " world"
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
'hello world'
</code></pre>
<p>In python 3.x, <code>input</code> has been scrapped and the function previously known as <code>raw_input</code> is now <code>input</code>. So you have to manually call <code>compile</code> and than <code>eval</code> if you want the old functionality.</p>
<pre><code>python2.x                    python3.x

raw_input()   --------------&gt; input()               
input()  -------------------&gt; eval(input())     
</code></pre>
<p>In 3.x, the above session goes like this</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = eval(input())
'hello'
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = eval(input())
x + ' world'
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
'hello world'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>So you were probably getting an error at the interpretor because you weren't putting quotes around your input. This is necessary because it's evaluated. Where you getting a name error?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>input() vs raw_input()</strong></p>
<p>raw_input collects the characters the user types and presents them as a string.
 input() doesn't just evaluate numbers but rather treats any input as Python code and tries to execute it. Knowledgeable but malicious user could type in a Python command that can even deleted a file. Stick to raw_input() and convert the string into the data type you need using Python's built in conversion functions. </p>
<p>Also input(), is not safe from user errors! It expects a valid Python expression as input; if the input is not syntactically valid, a SyntaxError will be raised.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Its simple:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>raw_input()</code> returns string values</li>
<li>while <code>input()</code> return integer values</li>
</ol>
<p>For Example:</p>
<p>1.</p>
<pre><code>x = raw_input("Enter some value = ")
print x
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Enter some value = 123
'123'
</code></pre>
<p>2.</p>
<pre><code>y = input("Enter some value = ") 
print y
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Enter some value = 123
123
</code></pre>
<p>Hence if we perform <code>x + x =</code> It will output as 123123</p>
<p>while if we perform <code>y + y =</code> It will output as 246</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Whats going on here i tried your lines on the console (3.x) and it interpreted  x = input() "hello" &lt;-- i type this on the console when asked) x + " world" y 'x + "world" Why? x is not translated into a string</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the error i was getting  &gt;&gt;&gt; x = input() Traceback (most recent call last):   File "&lt;console&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; EOFError: EOF when reading a line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Guillermo, The interpreter section I showed is for 2.x. I messed up on 3.x (i haven't played with it much at all) so I deleted that part of my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Mmm maybe i should start learning python 2.X i just wanted to have the latest with most future learning. but i don't want to get stuck like this as is a such a waste of time, i guess i could find another tutorial.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Guillermo, that's my final answer. Also, there's nothing that's a waste of time in the processes of learning. It turns out that I did have my understanding of 3.x right, I just tried to do something different in it. Why do you think you're wasting your time?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe on python 2.x, but not on python 3.x. input() in python 3.x always return a string. Moreover, raw_input() has been deleted from python 3</span>
