<p>Some python packages such as <code>flask</code> can be used as shell script after installation via <code>pip install</code>. My question is how to create them?</p>
<p>A minimal package can be written as below, and where to add codes?</p>
<pre><code>.
├── library_name
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── Foo.py
└── setup.py
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the entrypoints in your setup.py</p>
<pre><code>from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='Foo',
    version='1.0',
    packages=find_packages(),
    url='https://github.com/Bar/Foo.git',
    install_requires=[

    ],
    license='',
    classifiers=[
        'Development Status :: 3 - Alpha',

    ],
    keywords='foo bar',
    author='Mr Foo',

    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'foo = library_name.Foo:main',
        ],
    },
)
</code></pre>
<p>This way when you python setup.py install you can call foo from shell and it will execute main in Foo.py</p>
<p>Note that you need to change library_name, foo, Foo and main in case they have different names in your code.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, it works!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">May be we also need to add PATH: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46973667/python-console-scripts-doesnt-work-when-pip-install-user" title="python console scripts doesnt work when pip install user">stackoverflow.com/questions/46973667/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">no that is bad practice, use the virtualenv to modify PATH, don't mess with it manually</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What I mean is don't install ANYTHING, EVER if you are not in a virtualenvironment. That will also solve your path problem in this case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK, thanks again!</span>
