<p>I have a data set. This data set consists of only words. I have to do the vectoring of these words. I've searched for word vectoring algorithms. Bag of words, word2wec, tf-idf Bag of words, word2wec, tf-idf are doing the process of vectoring the words in a sentences. But I don't have sentences. i have just words. So how do I make the process of vectoring the words?</p>

<p><strong>Spacy</strong> has a library to get word vectors of <strong>300</strong> dimension.
You need to load a vector package as shown in the code. token.vector will give you the vector for one <strong>single</strong> word.</p>
<pre><code>import spacy
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_md')
token = nlp('Basketball')
print(token.vector)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What is your goal? What problem are you trying to solve?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is a data set consisting of only words. I need to convert these words into numerical data. Because I'm going to use these word vectors as input in an artificial neural network. @Blorgbeard</span>
<span class="comment-copy">tf-idf is a way of vectorizing <i>documents</i>, not specifically sentences. Presumably your words are somehow organized into articles, paragraphs, headlines, recipes, something. tf-idf is a basic way of transforming those documents into a vectorized bag of words for the entire <i>corpus</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, well it sounds like you just have a big set of words with no context, so you won't be able to extract embeddings yourself. I suggest you find pre-trained embeddings and join them with your dataset. E.g. <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GloVe</a></span>
