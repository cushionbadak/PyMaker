<p>The dataframe contains two columns UserID and Recommendations.The recommendation column contains productID of products recommended to that user along with ratings which is in the form of list.</p>
<p>What I want to do is if I click on user A001 then a graph should get display.The y-axis of graph will display productIDs recommended to A001 and X-axis will display rating of that product.This should be done in case of each UserID</p>
<p>I know how to plot a graph with single values using matplotlib but here it has a list of values .How can I go about it.</p>

<p>You can try this code to solve your problem:</p>
<pre><code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

for i in df.UserID:
  ratings = []
  productsIDs = []

  for points in df.Recommendations[np.where(df.UserID==i)[0]]:
    for point in points:
      ratings.append(point[1])
      productsIDs.append(point[0])

    plt.plot(ratings, productsIDs)
    plt.show()

<span class="comment-copy">Please show some code! People will be more likely to help if you provide evidence that you've given it a good go.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes I am working on it.Soon I will edit it with some code as even I am not getting how to start.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey,Thanks for trying.But this is not working for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you get an error message ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not an error message but the graphs are not showing correct result.It is taking wrong scale for ratings and ProductID is not shown on y-axis.Even plotting is not showing up,just x and y axis.I am trying to sort it properly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edited my code, I made some mistakes with the x and y axis names, now it should works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much.It's working as expected.</span>
