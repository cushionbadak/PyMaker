<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i already installed pyaudio 
but the problem is when i work with the microphone functions </p>
<pre><code>import speech_recognition as sr
r = sr.Recognizer()
mic = sr.Microphone()
</code></pre>
<p>the problem is in the third line <code>mic = sr.Microphone()</code> 
the terminal will give me this message </p>
<pre><code>Please build and install the PortAudio Python bindings first.
</code></pre>
<p>and if i try to install <code>pip install PortAudio</code> it will give me the following message </p>
<pre><code>Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement PortAudio (from versions: )No matching distribution found for PortAudio
</code></pre>
<p>so can any one help , it is like i have the pyaudio but the PortAudio is not there !!</p>

<p>first uninstall your pyAudio by <code>pip uninstall pyAudio</code></p>
<p>then you need to get the pyAudio compatible with your python version in my case i have 3.7 with 32bit , my problem was trying to install a 64bit pyAudio on my 32bit python .</p>
<p>after the uninstalling i went to this website: <a href="https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages</a></p>
<p>and i downloaded the [ PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp37‑cp37m‑win32.whl ]</p>
<p>the way to install it is to go to its directory in the cmd and type <code>pip install PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp37‑cp37m‑win32.whl</code> </p>
<p>and i think this will do and over come the PortAudio problem </p>
