<p>I have a sample code using AWS lambda function (python) to show a html page in browser, connection with API Gateway. </p>
<p>I want to use css file from S3 bucket in this Lambada funtion as a sample code.</p>
<p>When I try like this, but it can't. How can I use? <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2szCk.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="sample_cod" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2szCk.png"/></a></p>

<p>You need to make /test-bucket/test.css publicly available.</p>
<p>Understand that Lambda is not even accessing that file during runtime, but rather only referencing it inside a String object, so neither Lambda nor API Gateway are aware that there's a .css file at all.</p>
<p>When your function is executed through API Gateway, your Lambda is going to return a String containing your HTML code inside it. The browser will then try to render that HTML, meaning that the Browser itself is trying to load a file which is private inside one of your Buckets. It's exactly the same thing as creating a new index.html file on your machine and try loading that test.css. It just won't work due to lack of permissions.</p>
<p>Go to test-bucket/test.css and make the object publicly available, so the browser can load it successfully.</p>
<p>If you don't know how to make an object publicly available, I suggest you follow this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/read-access-objects-s3-bucket/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">article</a> on the Knowledge Center by AWS.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">this css/js file will be accessed from browser not by lambda function. just make that it's available for public.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I cann't understand well # BugHunter , How can I do this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when you open the link you have pasted in <code>href</code> in the browser, do you see you css code or do you get access denied error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, I don't see css code and show "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (Forbidden)" error.</span>
