<span class="comment-copy">thx for the formatting karel</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please give us your Airflow version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">apache-airflow v1.10.2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am curious about reason you want to import airflow in Notebook.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that is my preferred dev environment, my general line of work is data analysis. would you recommend trying a diff dev environment to resolve this issue?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"...apache-airflow has requirement flask&lt;0.31, &gt;=0.12.4, but you'll have flask 1.0.2 which is incompatible..."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But it works for me</span>
