<p>Where can I find the Python type hints for builtin classes and ABCs? For example, where can I find the type hint for <code>MutableSet[T].__isub__</code>, which I imagine is something like</p>
<pre><code>def __isub__(self, other: Set[T]) -&gt; None:
    ...
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Specifically for <code>MutableSet.__isub__</code>, I followed the imports to types.pyi, which defines the method as following:</p>
<pre><code>def __isub__(self, s: AbstractSet[Any]) -&gt; MutableSet[_T]: ...
</code></pre>
<p>This actually appears as part of <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed" rel="nofollow noreferrer">typeshed</a>, which Pycharm installs by default, so it's apparently not an integral part of CPython.
I assume you can do the same for other ABC's. I could not, however, find similar type hints for built-in types such as list.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you referring to type hints as given by a specific python IDE (editor), and if so, which?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The docs has the best info for type hints <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.MutableSet" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MattB. I'm looking for all the method type hintsâ€”not just the generic type names.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@InonPeled No, I'm looking for the type hints that are part of the Python language or part of mypy (I'm not sure which).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The stubs most IDEs use are collected in the <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>typeshed</code></a>, which is maintained along with the CPython and MyPy codebase. Builtins are defined <a href="https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/stdlib/2and3/builtins.pyi" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice job!  Do you have a link?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">(The type hints for list are probably under <code>Sequence</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edited my answer to include a link.</span>
