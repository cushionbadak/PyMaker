<p>I need to find the latest git issue number for a repository using python for all users rather than an authenticated user.
Is there any way i could do this? either through the API or any library?
I looked at the github docs and from my understanding it is not possible to list issues for all users but only authenticated users.
I looked at pygithub where all i could find was how to create an issue through the library</p>

<p>You can use the Github API's to get the list of issues or single issue</p>
<p>please check <code>https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#list-issues</code></p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>e.g. <code>https://api.github.com/repos/vmg/redcarpet/issues?sort=created&amp;direction=desc</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm going to echo a question in Klaus' comment: Why do you want this? As soon as you get that answer it could be out of date, e.g. if a user creates an issue just as you look up the most recent one. This is almost certainly an <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66377/248627">XY problem</a>.</span>
