<p>I am working on a project in pycharm. I am trying to import nltk to my project like this. I have tried installing it through many different ways and they all lead to the same outcome. The error shown in the end.</p>
<p>I tried installing it through the lightbulb on pycharm, I tried installing the module through the project settings, I tried installing nltk through conda -install nltk. I don't understand why I get this error. Can someone shed some light. Thank you in advance!</p>
<pre><code>import nltk    
nltk.download()

<p>For anyone that has the same problem in the future by following Pavel Karateev's advice I was able to solve this. I created a normal conda environment and installed all the packages through anaconda prompt by using e.g. conda -install nltk in the conda virtual environment I had created.</p>
<p>From what I understand the problem was that I had created a venv with PyCharm UI using anaconda as a base which is a big mistake!</p>

<p>You need to specified the module. Also see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22211525/how-do-i-download-nltk-data">How do I download NLTK data?</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">The problem is most likely relevant to the known issue in PyCharm <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-27234" rel="nofollow noreferrer">youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-27234</a>. Meanwhile, there're multiple things to clarify: which PyCharm version is this? how did you create this virtualenv exactly? which base path was used during the venv creation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like you did create a venv with PyCharm UI using anaconda as a base, which is the sick child of both worlds. You should <b>either</b> create a normal conda environment (and use PyCharm 2019.1 RC to prevent PY-27234) <b>or</b> create a Python virtualenv using interpreter from python.org and ignore conda whatsoever.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't work friend. I still get the same exact error.</span>
