<p>You just need to pass full directory to file with server address. In my local network I use something like this:</p>
<pre><code>s_address = '//192.168.0.250//'
#copy file:
shutil.copy2(file_to_copy, s_address+'folder on network disc')
#create new file and write to it:
with open(s_address+'folder//test1.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    w = csv.writer(csvfile, delimiter='\t')
    w.writerow('test')
</code></pre>
<p>etc</p>
</div>
