<p>I am trying to input the 5 numbers in defined length set and try to print out those numbers but it's giving "TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable" this error.</p>
<pre><code>print("enter 5 numbers")
a=set(5)
for i in range(0,5):
    a.append(int(input("enter a number")))
for i in range(0,5):
    print("numbers in array are",a[i])

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think there is some confusion on what <code>set</code> actually does. I assume you want to make a predefined set of length 5. When doing:</p>
<pre><code>set(5)
</code></pre>
<p>you get:</p>
<pre><code> TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
</code></pre>
<p>because you're trying to make a set containing only the integer 5. If you want to make a <code>set</code> from that, you would have to include an iterable, maybe like so:</p>
<pre><code>set((5,))

Out: {5}
</code></pre>
<p>But what I would recommend you to do is declare</p>
<pre><code>a = []  # create an empty list
</code></pre>
<p>and then run your code. At the end then, I would make a <code>set</code> by typing</p>
<pre><code>a = set(a)
</code></pre>
<p>Hopefully that was helpful for you! Have fun coding! :)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You cannot fix the size of set while creating. </p>
<p><code>a = set(5)</code> is the source of your error. </p>
<p>Also, sets do not have <code>append</code> method. You should use <code>a.add("data")</code> for adding elements to the set. </p>
<p>To ensure that the size of set does not exceed a particular length, you can try something like this</p>
<pre><code>fixed_length = 3
a=set()
for i in range(0,5):
    if len(a) == fixed_length:
        break
    else:
        a.add(int(input("enter a number")))

for index, element in enumerate(a):
    print("numbers in array are", element)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">sets are not arrays! Your code would fail because 5 is not iterable. Also set has add and not append to add elements. Getting element by index from set will also not work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also, <code>set</code> does not have a method <code>.append()</code>; maybe you want to use <code>.add()</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>{5}</code> instead of <code>set((5,))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">it is shorter, yes. but i was trying to highlight the difference to the code before here</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So how can I store 5 numbers given by a user and then print them?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AaquibAhmedDiaz I have updated the answer to include the same.</span>
