<p>I must execute a Python script on the iPad but I don't know how to do that (without use Pythonista). Indeed, I find some example of the desktop application but I don't want to make a desktop application. I must create an iOS application (iPhone and Android) without any computer.</p>
<p>1) I have a python's script for example:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

print "Hello World!"
</code></pre>
<p>2) I have a Swift's application</p>
<p>3) I don't know have installed Python on my device and how to execute my python script.</p>
<p>Can you help me?</p>

<p>As far as I know, there is no Python runtime environment for iOS except Pythonista. But you can do a lot with Pythonista, so unless you've got really killing arguments for not using it, you could give it a try.</p>
