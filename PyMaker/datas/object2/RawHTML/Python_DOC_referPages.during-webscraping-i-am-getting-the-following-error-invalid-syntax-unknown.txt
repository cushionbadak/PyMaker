<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am writing this code to web scrap but I am continuously getting this error invalid syntax on the line "print(post)".</p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as b
url_base="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_nkw="
requests="ps4"
url_separator="&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_pgn="
page_num="1"
url=url_base + requests + url_separator + page_num 
html= urllib.request.urlopen(url).read()
soup = b(html,'html.parser')
for post in soup.find_All("li",{"class":"s-item"}):
print(post)
</code></pre>
<p>I am using python 3.4.4. Your help would be very much appreciated.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to fix <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/statement-indentation-comments#indentation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">indentation</a> of the <code>print(post)</code> line and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12339323/beautifulsoup-findall-find-all">use <code>find_all</code> function</a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>for post in soup.find_all("li",{"class":"s-item"}):
  print(post)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>find_All</code> should be <code>find_all</code>; also your indentation as posted is wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have changed to find_all but still having the same error.. What do you mean by indentation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Indentation is part of the Python syntax. It is basically the first thing you learn in every Python course.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">E.g. <a href="https://www.python-course.eu/python3_blocks.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have tried to fix the indentations but the error still persists, can it be the fault of my python version??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much sir. I have like wasted so much time on that and thanks for rescuing me... :')</span>
