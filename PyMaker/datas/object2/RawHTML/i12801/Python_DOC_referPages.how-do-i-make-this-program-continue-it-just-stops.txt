<p>I know this is terrible code, but it's my first one. Everything works atleast, up to the point where it says "You Win". It should continue onto the next fight, but instead it just stops there. Where is my main issue (besides poor formatting and redundant code)?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I second @KarolyHorvath, try to break down your logic into smaller parts and put those parts into functions. Furthermore, add <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">logging</a> to the code, so that you always know, where you are. It is simpler and faster to debugging it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you change the order:while True: userInput = input() for this userInput = input() while true ¿?</span>
