<p>I have the following tuple:</p>
<pre><code>tuple = (65,67,5,67,34,76,67,231,98,67)
</code></pre>
<p>When I did the following:</p>
<pre><code>print tuple3[2:8]
</code></pre>
<p>I got:</p>
<pre><code>(5, 67, 34, 76, 67, 231)
</code></pre>
<p>I thought that <code>98</code> should be also included. Isn't <code>98</code> on the index number 8? Why isn't <code>98</code> included?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For a tuple or list - <code>x[start:end]</code>, slicing in python begins at <code>start</code> and runs till <code>end-1</code>.</p>
<p>That is the reason 98 is not included in your code</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Slicing is [included:excluded]. This allows for things like <code>slicable[i:len(sliceable)]</code></span>

<span class="comment-copy">Why the downvotes? Question is well formulated and answerable. It's quite clearly a dupe as noted above, but not a bad question <i>per se</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tibo: NMDV, but one DV criterion is "does not show any research effort", and every tutorial on Python's slice notation explains this.</span>
