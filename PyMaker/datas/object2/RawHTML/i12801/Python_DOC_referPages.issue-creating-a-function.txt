<p>I'm trying to take this piece of code and put it into a function however it's not printing when I run it, this is the following code I've written, what's missing? Thank you for your help!</p>
<pre><code>def pred():   

    with open('AquaticFoodWeb.txt') as input:
        for line in input:
            animal, prey = line.strip().split(' eats ')
            foodweb.setdefault(animal, []).append(prey)

        print ("Predators and Prey:")

        for animal, prey in sorted(foodweb.items()):
            if len(prey) &gt; 1:
                print ("{} eats {} and {}".format(animal, ",     ".join(prey[:-1]), prey[-1]))
            else:
                print ("{} eats {}".format(animal, ", ".join(prey)))


    if __name__ == "__pred__":
        pred()
</code></pre>

<p>When a python file is executed it is assigned a name. The initial file that is executed via "python file.py" is assigned the name "main" and it is stored under the variable <code>__name__</code>. In other cases, say the file is imported ("import file") then <code>__name__</code> is assigned a different name.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you are actually putting <code>if __name__ == "__pred__":</code> inside the function then it won't run. Dedent it to the top level. (And change to <code>"__main__"</code> as mentioned above).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ohhhhh! Looks like I was relatively close ahah. Your explanation was perfect! Thank you so much!</span>
