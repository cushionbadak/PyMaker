<p>I have a .csv file which I want to sort.</p>
<p>I currently have two columns, 'Name' and 'Score'. </p>
<p>I'd like to use SQLite to sort these two columns in Python 3. I want to sort 'Name' by alphabetical order and 'Score' by score highest to lowest.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't need to use sqlite3 to sort it.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort" rel="nofollow"><code>list.sort</code></a> or <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted" rel="nofollow"><code>sorted</code></a> with a key function: <code>lambda row: (row[0], -int(row[1])))</code> after loading the csv file as a list.</p>
