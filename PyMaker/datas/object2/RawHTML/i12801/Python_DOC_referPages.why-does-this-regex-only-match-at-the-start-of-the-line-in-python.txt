<p>In Python I can do</p>
<pre><code>import re
re.match("m", "mark")
</code></pre>
<p>and I get the expected result:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 1), match='m'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>But it only works if the pattern is at the start of the string:</p>
<pre><code>re.match("m", "amark")
</code></pre>
<p>gives <code>None</code>.  There is noting about that pattern which requires it to be at the start of the string - no <code>^</code> or similar.  Indeed it works as expected on <a href="https://www.regex101.com/" rel="nofollow">regex101</a>.</p>
<p>Does Python have some special behaviour - and how do I disable it please?</p>

<p>From the docs on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.match</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If zero or more characters <em>at the beginning</em> of <code>string</code> match the regular expression <code>pattern</code>, return a corresponding match object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.search</code></a> to search the entire string.</p>
<p>The docs even grant this issue its own chapter, outlining the differences between the two: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#search-vs-match" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>search()</code> vs. <code>match()</code></a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import re 
re.match("[^m]*m", "mark")
</code></pre>
<p><code>match</code> matches from beginning of string.So you need to give it a way to match the start of string if <code>m</code> is not at start of string.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This question is not a duplicate of the one marked. Yes the answers are duplicates, but the question comes at the problem from a completely different angle.  I would have to have known the answer to my question to recognise the other as a "duplicate".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is a dupe by all means, if not that one, there is another one regarding <code>re.match</code>. BTW, <code>re.match</code> is not matching at the start of a <i>line</i>, it only matches at the start of a <i>string</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't say it wasn't a dupe.  I said it wasn't a dupe of the one marked.  It should be marked as a dupe of a question it's a dupe of, not of some other one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's definitely a duplicate. Besides, the documentation for <code>re.match</code> clearly says that it tries to "apply the pattern at the start of the string." A few moments of research would have been well-spent here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd like to note that the question phrased in this fashion made it possible for me to find an answer. I did read the docs, but I missed that on my first pass.  Thank you for asking this question.</span>
