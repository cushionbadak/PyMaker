<p>I need to get the data from the line that is below my match </p>
<p>example:</p>
<pre><code>for line in file:
  if 'string' in line:
    doSomething(nextline)
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried a few different ways . I always get a traceback </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you have a file object, you could do:</p>
<pre><code>for line in f:
    if SOMETEXT in line:
        foo(next(f))  # not next(line), next(f)
</code></pre>
<p>However this will cause your <code>for</code> loop to skip the next line. Instead you could iterate by two lines.</p>
<pre><code>import itertools

with open(...) as f:
    a, b = itertools.tee(f)
    next(b)  # skips a line in the "next line" iterator
    for thisline, nextline in zip(a,b):
        if SOMETEXT in thisline:
            foo(nextline)
</code></pre>
<p>This is actually the <code>pairwise</code> recipe on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools</code> recipe</a> page in the docs. Keep that link handy -- it's incredibly useful</p>
<pre><code>def pairwise(iterable):
    "s -&gt; (s0,s1), (s1,s2), (s2, s3), ..."
    a, b = tee(iterable)
    next(b, None)
    return zip(a, b)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">a traceback that you've chosen not to include? :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sry had been through many attempts.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">include the error, include your attempt, include a mockup file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you very much this is very helpful</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My out put is nothing .. am i doing something wrong . I know the string is in there</span>
<span class="comment-copy">a, b = itertools.tee(log)             next(b)             for firstline, secondline in zip(a, b):                 if "[DETECTION]" in firstline:                     print(secondline)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">without knowing what's in <code>log</code>, it's hard to say what's gone wrong. You should try debugging it and seeing what's going on with your file. <code>print(firstline)</code> in the <code>for</code> loop or etc.</span>
