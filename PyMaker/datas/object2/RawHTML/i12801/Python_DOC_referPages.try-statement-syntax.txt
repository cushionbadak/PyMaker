<p>I have been reading <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#try" rel="nofollow">python documentation</a> , could someone help me with interpreting this?</p>
<pre><code>try_stmt  ::=  try1_stmt | try2_stmt
try1_stmt ::=  "try" ":" suite
               ("except" [expression [("as" | ",") identifier]] ":" suite)+
               ["else" ":" suite]
               ["finally" ":" suite]
try2_stmt ::=  "try" ":" suite
               "finally" ":" suite
</code></pre>
<p>I initially thought it meant that try statements had to have either formats </p>
<ol>
<li><code>try</code> And <code>finally</code> or</li>
<li><code>try</code>, <code>except</code>, <code>else</code> AND <code>finally</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>But after reading the documentation, it mentioned that <code>else</code> is optional and so is <code>finally</code>. So, I was wondering what is the purpose of the documentation showing us the code in the above format to begin with?</p>

<p>You <strong>do</strong> have two forms of the <code>try</code> statement. The main difference between them is that in the case of <code>try1_stmt</code> an <code>except</code> clause <strong>must be specified</strong>. </p>
<p>In <strong><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/introduction.html#notation" rel="nofollow">Introduction | Notation</a></strong> of the Python Language reference, the following is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A star <strong>(*) means zero or more repetitions</strong> of the preceding
  item; likewise, <strong>a plus (+) means one or more repetitions</strong>, and a phrase enclosed in square brackets <strong>([ ]) means zero
  or one occurrences</strong> (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional)</em> . The * and + operators bind as tightly as possible;
  <strong><em>parentheses are used for grouping</em></strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, specifically, in the first form:</p>
<pre><code>try1_stmt ::=  "try" ":" suite
               ("except" [expression [("as" | ",") identifier]] ":" suite)+
               ["else" ":" suite]
               ["finally" ":" suite]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>else</code> and <code>finally</code> clauses <strong>are optional <code>([])</code></strong>, you only require a <code>try</code> statement and <strong><em>one</em></strong> or more <code>(+)</code></p></div>
<span class="comment-copy">The brackets mean optional. The parens on the <code>except</code> are used for grouping with the <code>+</code> (because the <code>except</code> can occur more than once in that form).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks alot. This explanation is very clear. Would you mind explaining what it means by as tightly as possible? "The * and + operators bind as tightly as possible"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not 100% sure about this because lexical definitions is something I haven't been exposed to in depth. What I'm guessing this means is that it has a higher precedence, so, a rule like <code>a_rule ::= part1 | part2*</code> ( the <code>|</code> symbol means <b>or</b>) should be interpeted as <code>a_rule ::= part1 | (part2*)</code> and not as <code>a_rule ::= (part1 | part2)*</code>. I hope this makes some sense to you.</span>
