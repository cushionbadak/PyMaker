<p>I am trying to  make a vector out of two different ones as shown in the piece of code below.
However, I get a list out of range exception on the 5th line the first time the code goes in the for loop.</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<pre><code>def get_two_dimensional_vector(speeds, directions):
    vector = []
    for i in range(10):
        if (i % 2 == 0):
            vector[i/2][0] = speeds[i/2]
        else :
            vector[i/2 - 1/2][1] = directions[i/2 - 1/2]
</code></pre>

<p>You can't use a Python list this way. It's not like a C array with a
predefined length. If you want to add a new element, you have to use the
<code>append</code> method or something.</p>
<p>Aside from that, you're also using a second index, implying that the
elements of <code>vector</code> are themselves lists or dicts or something, before
they've even been assigned.</p>
<p>It looks like you want to convert <code>speeds</code> and <code>directions</code> to a
two-dimensional list. So, first, here's how to do that with a loop. Note
that I've removed the fixed-size assumption you were using, though the
code still assumes that <code>speeds</code> and <code>directions</code> are the same size.</p>
<pre><code>def get_two_dimensional_vector(speeds, directions):
    vector = []
    for i in range(len(speeds)):
        vector.append([speeds[i], directions[i]])
    return vector

speeds = [1, 2, 3]
directions = [4, 5, 6]

v = get_two_dimensional_vector(speeds, directions)
print(v)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the Pythonic way to do it.</p>
<pre><code>print(zip(speeds, directions))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> in the loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">[i/2 - 1/2] in the final line should be replaced by [(i - 1)/2] for starters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If it's integer division, you don't even need to do that. It will round down anyway.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem is that the OP uses a list of lists whereas the <code>vector</code> is only a list. That's why he gets the out of index error. I am not sure if the duplicated question has something to do with this one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tasos: it will throw a list out of range error even before it has a chance to access the second dimension(index).</span>
