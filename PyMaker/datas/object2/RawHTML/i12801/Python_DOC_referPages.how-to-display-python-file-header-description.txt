<p>I was wondering if you knew how to run a python file to only display the file description. 
For example I have these lines on the top of my python program.</p>
<pre><code>"""
===================================================
    test.py
    sphchow

    Description
====================================================
"""
</code></pre>
<p>I want to be able to run it so it displays this. But also have the ability to run the program normally. I tried searching around and could only find information like <code>__docstring__</code> I think I'm not using the right key words?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Say your module is <code>foo.py</code> then you can do:</p>
<pre><code>import foo
print(foo.__doc__)
</code></pre>
<p>This will print the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-docstring" rel="nofollow">docstring</a> for the module.</p>
<p>Or from the command line:</p>
<pre><code>python -c "import foo; print(foo.__doc__)"
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned in the comments, this information is also displayed when you use the help command:</p>
<pre><code>help(foo)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>__docstring__</code> is the name of the lines at the top of the program.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can also access it through <code>import foo; help(foo)</code>, which will give you other information as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks guys, this was exactly what I was looking for</span>
