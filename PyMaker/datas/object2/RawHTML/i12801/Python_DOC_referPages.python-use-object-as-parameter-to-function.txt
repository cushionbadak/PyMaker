<p>I have a function in a loop that takes 5 parameters, saves them and uses their new values over and over again. But it looks messy and I wonder if I can make a class for these variables, and just use an object as parameter in my function.</p>
<pre><code>while encounter:
    player, minion, monster, arrow, encounter = fight(player, minion, monster, arrow, encounter)
</code></pre>
<p>Is it possible? If so, how do I do it? Thank you!</p>

<p>If I understood what you're trying to do, you might try using a <a href="http://www.python-course.eu/python3_dictionaries.php" rel="nofollow">dictionary</a>.</p>
<pre><code>characterObject = {
    "player": player,
    "minion" : minion,
    "monster": monster,
    "arrrow": arrow,
    "encounter": encounter
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can then pass that single object to a function, and the receiving function could look something like:</p>
<pre><code>def testFunc(characterObject):
    #Print the value of the "player" key
    print(characterObject["player"])
    #call some other function 
    otherFunc(characterObject["arrow"])

testFunc(characterObject)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, class with those five attributes and the method <code>fight()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can make a class, but this isn't the place for tutorials. If you head over to the python.org website, the documentation section probably has a tutorial to help you get started.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or a <code>dict</code>, if you need a lot of flexibility about what data is stored.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Store in a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dict</code></a> or create a new class. If you don't know how to do that check out some tutorials.
