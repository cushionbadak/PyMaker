<p>I'm practicing for my finals, doing a task where I'm to assign a number to a spot in a row/column system. The suggested method of solving is this:</p>
<pre><code>def readOneNumber():
    row = int(input("Row (1-9): "))
    col = int(input("Column (1-9): "))
    num = int(input("The number (1-9): "))     
    print("Position ({:d},{:d}) now contains {:d}".format(row, col, num))
</code></pre>
<p>So I am specifically asking about the content of the print function. Does the {:d} part just mean a dictionary by the name of (row, col, num)?</p>
<p><strong>I was wrong in my assumption that this was about dictionaries. It was actually a formatting tool</strong></p>
<p>I'm sorry if this is a stupid question.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It is a formatting character. It tells the formatter to treat the argument as an integer number and format it as such. Other valid formatters could be <code>x</code> to format it as a hexadecimal number, or <code>b</code> for binary, etc.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings" rel="nofollow"><em>Format String Syntax</em></a>, and more specifically, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language" rel="nofollow"><em>Format Specification Mini-Language</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>'d'</code><br/>
  Decimal Integer. Outputs the number in base 10.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each <code>{...}</code> part is a slot, and the positional arguments to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>str.format()</code> method</a> are slotted in in the same order.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Ah, so it doesn't actually assign the number to a spot in a system? It just prints a plaintext of the input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matsern: yes, it's a template string, and the <code>{..}</code> parts are slots.</span>
