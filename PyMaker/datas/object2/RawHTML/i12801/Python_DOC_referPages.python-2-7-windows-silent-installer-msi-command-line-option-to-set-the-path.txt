<p>When installing python 2.7 on Windows using silent installer (.msi), is there a command-line option to add Python to path environment variable, like the GUI option?</p>
<p>Python 3.5 installer includes an option PrependPath=0 by default, but can Python 2.7 use it?</p>

<p>Looks like this issue was discussed here, but no resolution for Python 2.7?</p>

<p>EDIT</p>
<hr/>
<p>this batch command rocks!!!</p>
<p>setx \M PATH "%PATH%;C:\Python\Python27;C:\Python\Python27\Scripts"</p>
<p>but setx will truncate the stored %PATH% string to 1024 bytes.</p>

<p>The Python MSI installer can update the system path since 2.4. Just add <strong>ADDLOCAL=ALL</strong> to the command line. You'll have to restart your system before it propagates.</p>
<pre><code>msiexec /i "python-2.7.11.amd64.msi" /passive /norestart ADDLOCAL=ALL
</code></pre>

<p>I have observed that on Windows 7 (Professional) with python 2.7.14 x64, no restart is required for Python to be added to PATH.  Just start up a new command window after the install and python will be in the PATH.</p>
<p>You can determine whether or not a restart is required by the install by running the msi as follows:</p>
<pre><code>start/wait "" msiexec /i "python-2.7.11.amd64.msi" /passive /norestart ADDLOCAL=ALL
if %errorlevel% == 3010 ( echo Success: reboot required ) else (if %errorlevel% == 0 ( echo Success ) else ( echo Installation failed with error code %errorlevel% ) )
</code></pre>
<p>That is, if <code>%errorlevel%</code> is 3010 (ERROR_SUCCESS_REBOOT_REQUIRED), then a reboot will be required.  The use of <code>start/wait</code> causes cmd.exe to wait until the msiexec process finishes.  This allows the msiexec return status to be available to cmd.exe.</p>
<p>BTW You may wish to include the option <code>ALLUSERS=1</code> on the command line if you want the installation of Python to be available to all users on the system.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">afaik you can set it through the registry .... if thats helpful ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">msi installer should add python to windows registry by default, but adding to path env. var. is different.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no i mean the PATH can be modified through the windows registry</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@JoranBeasley add your answer, I'm going to accept it!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"You'll have to restart your system before it propagates." - this is not an option in my case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perhaps the author meant "restart prompt" instead of system. Running msiexec as above with ADDLOCAL=ALL successfully introduces python to PATH in your next cmd session.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, Chris, I meant system restart. This option updates the registry but it does not force Windows Explorer/Shell to reload the new path value. There's a way to do that, but apparently the Python installer doesn't use it. So, if you launch a program from Explorer after running the installation, the new process inherits the old path, not the registry path. I haven't tested this in ~8 months. Maybe it's changed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just tested this on Windows XP (I know) and can confirm an entire restart was required after using <code>ADDLOCAL=ALL</code> with the Python 3.4 MSI installer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is restart needed also for 3.5.exe Installer? If i start Installer manually there is no need of restart. :/ I am dealing with this problem here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47310884/adding-into-path-var-while-silent-installation-of-python-possible-bug" title="adding into path var while silent installation of python possible bug">stackoverflow.com/questions/47310884/â€¦</a></span>
