<p>I am aware of the \xb function in python, but it does not seem to work for me. I am aware that I may need to download a third party module to accomplish this, if so, which one would be best? I am a noob with Python, and with StackOverflow hence my basic question. Now a bit about the context... </p>
<p>I am currently writing a binomial expansion solver, to try and use skills which I am teaching myself. The problem arises when I attempt to display the user input-ed expansion to the use for confirmation. Currently I am having to print the expression like so: </p>
<pre><code>var1 = input("Enter a: ")
var2 = input("Enter b: ")
exponent = input("Enter n: ")

a = int(var1)
b = int(var2)
n = int(exponent)

expression = ('(%(1)dx%(2)d)^%(3)d') %\
{'1' : a, '2' : b, '3' : n}

print(expression)

confirmation = input(str("Is this correctt? Y/N "))
</code></pre>
<p>This prints (2x4)^5, whereas I'd prefer the index to be printed as superscript. How can this be done? I will provide any (missing) information if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <code>sympy</code> module that does necessary formatting for you. It supports many formats such as ascii, unicode, latex, mathml, etc:</p>
<pre><code>from sympy import pretty_print as pp, latex
from sympy.abc import a, b, n

expr = (a*b)**n
pp(expr) # default
pp(expr, use_unicode=True)
print(latex(expr))
print(expr.evalf(subs=dict(a=2,b=4,n=5)))
</code></pre>
<h3>Output</h3>
<pre><code>     n
(a*b) 
     n
(a⋅b) 
$\left(a b\right)^{n}$
32768.0000000000

<p>You need to use a 'format' type thing. Use <code>{}\u00b2".format(area))" and the</code>{}<code>becomes a</code>²`. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>print("The area of your rectangle is {}cm\u00b2".format(area))
</code></pre>
<p>The end of the code will print <code>cm²</code>. You can change the large 2 at the end to other numbers for a different result.
I do not know how to do a lower subscript though.</p>

<p>You're using <code>input()</code>, so I imagine this is console-based. To that end, you have two options, as previously discussed <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/597813/1114089">here</a>. One is to use a bit of formatting trickery to display the exponents on the line above the actual expansion. The other is to use these nifty characters, assuming your console supports Unicode:</p>
<pre><code>⁰¹²³⁴⁵⁶⁷⁸⁹
</code></pre>
<p>You're probably going to have to increase the font size by quite a bit for them to be legible, but it's certainly a viable option assuming proper support. Aside from that, though, you mentioned this is a personal learning experience; why not combine it with another and learn the simpler aspects of Pygame? It's very straightforward, text manipulation and keyboard events couldn't be simpler, and it's never a wrong step to branch out.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python 3.6+ (mentioned only because the example uses f-strings that are not available in previous versions) named Unicode characters provide an easy to write, easy to read way to do this. <a href="https://unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NamesList.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here is a list.</a></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>f'\N{GREEK SMALL LETTER GAMMA}={density:.2f} t/m\N{SUPERSCRIPT THREE}'
</code></pre>
<p>yields something like </p>
<pre><code>γ=1.20 t/m³

<p>Your Python program is probably running as a console application which can only output characters w/o formatting.  The simple answer to your question is "you can't do it".  </p>
<p>Of course it is possible to write a GUI application, our output to a document format which supports formatting (RTF, HTML, TeX, etc), but this is most likely beyond the scope of the homework problem you are working on.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As MK already said, you cannot format output on the command line (besides some colors and bold/blinking depending on the terminal). However, you could write it in a way that is likely to be understood by your users. If they are from the academic sector, you could use the latex-style way to express superscripts, e.g. <code>x^2</code></p>

<h2>Unicode character is the solution!</h2>
<hr/>
<p>There is a very easy way to print superscripts and subscripts using Unicode characters. Do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press alt+f2</li>
<li>Type "charmap"</li>
</ul>
<p>On doing so, you'll get tons of characters including subscripts, superscripts, etc. On the bottom left end of the window, you'd see something like 'U-xxxx' where x can be any alpha-numeric character(e.g 1,2,A,B..).</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you want to print a string x^2, you should write the string as:</p>
<p>'x\u00b2', where u00b2 is 'U+00B2' shown in the Character Map.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>This is how I used Character Map in my tkinter code snippet and it worked  without any errors.</em></strong></p>

<span class="comment-copy">You need to specify your output device/format because that determines <i>how</i> the superscript is to be marked up. E.g., in HTML you would output <code>(2x4)&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;</code>.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">This actually works since <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 3.3</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, it doesn't: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">since 3.6</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not the f-strings, the \N{name} escape sequence.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the reply, but no, I intend to write the barebones of the program without a GUI then once I am satisfied that everything works, I will create a GUI for it. I plan on using tkinter for my GUI, would it be possible using tkinter then? If not, which module would be suitable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This <i>must</i> be for some single platform only. Windows? If it is: you can only find those characters in fonts that support them (and I'd then advise using Arial MS Unicode). But since OP wants to create a console based program, those same characters must also be available in the console font.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I use Ubuntu 18.04 and it works here, I'm unaware of windows</span>
