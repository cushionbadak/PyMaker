<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a file which contains data in the following format: <em>please note this is an example of what it looks like, the actual file contains more than 2 rows</em> </p>
<pre><code>1    30    5
2    64    4
</code></pre>
<p>I read in the file, convert the text to integers, and store them into a list. This is done with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>file = open("dataFile.txt", "r") 
items = [] 
for line in file:
    line = map(int,line.split()) #convert the text data to integers 
    items.append(line) #add text data to list
</code></pre>
<p>The current format for the list looks like:</p>
<pre><code>[[1, 30, 5], [2, 64, 4]]
</code></pre>
<p>I need to turn my list of lists into a dictionary. How would one go about doing this? </p>
<p>Dictionary key should be the first element</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm going to play guess-what-you-want, and assume the first numbers in each row are in fact some kind of sequential identifier, and you want</p>
<pre><code>1    30    5
2    64    4
</code></pre>
<p>to become</p>
<pre><code>1  : [30, 5]
2  : [64, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>so...</p>
<pre><code>with open("dataFile.txt") as dataFile:
    items = {}
    for line in dataFile:
        line = map(int, line.split())  #convert the text data to integers
        key, value = line[0], line[1:]
        items[key] = value
</code></pre>
<p>(and I've changed the name of <code>file</code> because <code>file()</code> is already a builtin function in Python, and reusing that name for something else is bad form).</p>
<hr/>
<p>Or you could use a dictionary comprehension instead, starting with your items list:</p>
<pre><code>itemDict = {item[0]: item[1:] for item in items}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming you want your dictionary key to be the 1st element of the list, here is an implementation:</p>
<pre><code>list = [[1, 30, 5], [2, 64, 4]]
dict = {}

for l2 in list:
    dict[l2[0]] = l2[1:]
</code></pre>
<p>It works by iterating through <code>list</code>, and the sub-list <code>l2</code>. Then, I take the 1st element of <code>l2</code> and assign it as a key to <code>dict</code>, and then take the rest of the elements of <code>l2</code> and put it as the value.</p>
<p>The result is the finished dictionary <code>{1: [30, 5], 2: [64, 4]}</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you want the dictionary key to be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Dictionary of what?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In your example, write what the end result should be. The only thing I can think of is <code>{1: [30, 5], 2: [64, 4]}</code>... but that has its problems, e.g. what if there are two rows starting with number 1? BTW, <i>why</i> do you want a dictionary in the first place? What is wrong with a list of lists of numbers being stored as a list of lists of numbers?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have a feeling this will turn into a problem that needs a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2970608/what-are-named-tuples-in-python">namedtuple</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OrderedDict</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">how would you obtain something like: items = ( (1, 30, 5), (2, 64, 4) ), is this still a dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, that is a tuple. Dictionaries have to have a key-value pair, like a hash-table. Also, what is your key in the program? First value?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how would you implement a tuple? Correct, my key is the first value which corresponds to an ID</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To declare tuple, you just do <code>tuple =  ( (1, 30, 5), (2, 64, 4) )</code>, but if you want to change list -&gt; tuple, then you need a for-loop in addition to calling <code>tuple(list)</code> to convert the 2nd degree lists to tuples as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Currently, I could find implementaion of 1D list to tuple: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12836128/python-convert-list-to-tuple" title="python convert list to tuple">stackoverflow.com/questions/12836128/â€¦</a>, but sorry, I currently don't know how to implement 2D conversions :-( ...</span>
