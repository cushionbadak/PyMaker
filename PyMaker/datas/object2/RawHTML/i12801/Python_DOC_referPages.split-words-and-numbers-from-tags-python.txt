<p>I have a sentence: "Am/V I/NN good/Adj enough/Prep for/Prep 1/2/NUM" and I have to split into words and tags and create two different dictionaries - for words and for tags. I saw a thread here but there wasn't a word about splitting this thing - 1/2/NUM.</p>
<p>So I suppose I have to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>s = "Am/V I/NN good/Prep enough/Prep for/Prep 1/2/NUM"
sent = s.split()
for word in sent:
    word = word.split('/[a-z]')
dict_of_words = list(words[0])
doct_of_tags = list(words[1])
</code></pre>
<p>but then I get this:</p>
<pre><code>['Am/'V]
['I/NN']
[good/Prep]
etc.
</code></pre>
<p>How do I solve this issue?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow"><code>split</code></a> on the spaces first:</p>
<pre><code>s = "Am/V I/NN good/Prep enough/Prep for/Prep 1/2/NUM"
sent = s.split()
</code></pre>
<p>Then for each item <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rsplit" rel="nofollow"><code>rsplit</code></a> on the <code>/</code> character:</p>
<pre><code>for item in sent:
    data = item.rsplit('/', 1)
    word = data[0]
    tag = data[1]
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you prefer more concise code:</p>
<pre><code>for item in sent:
    word, tag = item.rsplit('/', 1)
</code></pre>

<p>As noted in the comments on shuttle87's answer, here is a simple example showing split with regex in case you need to split on multiple characters, which you can't do with the string split method.</p>
<pre><code>import re

s = "Am/V I/NN good/Prep enough/Prep for/Prep 1/2/NUM"

parts = s.split(" ")
words_tags = [re.split(r'/(?=[A-Za-z])', part) for part in parts]

words = []
tags = []
for word_tag in words_tags:
    words.append(word_tag[0])
    tags.append(word_tag[1])
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>['Am', 'I', 'good', 'enough', 'for', '1/2']<br/>
  ['V', 'NN', 'Prep', 'Prep', 'Prep', 'NUM']</p>
</blockquote>

<span class="comment-copy">What's your expected output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is your expected output for this input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Those aren't dictionaries and it is bad style to name something like <code>dict_...</code> if it is not a dict.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd like to get a list of words and list of tags for the output</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Repzz Another item worth noting is that in your example you're trying to split on multiple characters, which you can't do, and using a regex in the string split method. To split on multiple characters, regex is the right choice, but you need <code>import re</code> and <code>re.split(r'/', words)</code> for example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@binarysubstrate perhaps make that an answer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@shuttle87 I didn't want to step on your answer, but sure I'll post it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@binarysubstrate thank you! But with these method I don't get 1/2 as one and with shuttle87-method I get it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! I need to get 1/2 from "1/2/NUM" adn I can't get it using re.strip</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Repzz that's no problem. You just need to update the regex to <code>/(?=[A-Za-])</code>. I've updated my answer to produce the desired output. When you post a question again, it's helpful if you also indicate the desired output.  :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you once again! =)</span>
