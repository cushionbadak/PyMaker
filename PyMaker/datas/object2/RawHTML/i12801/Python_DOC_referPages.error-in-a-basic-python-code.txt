<p>so I just started Python today. Tried a basic program, but I'm getting an error "can't convert int object to str implicity"</p>
<pre><code>userName = input('Please enter your name: ' )
age = input('Please enter your age: ')

factor = 2
finalAge = age + factor  **ERRORS OUT ON THIS LINE**
multAge = age * factor
divAge = age / factor


print('In', factor, 'years you will be', finalAge, 'years old', userName )
print('Your age multiplied by', factor, 'is', multAge )
print('Your age divided by', factor, 'is', divAge )
</code></pre>
<p>When I do enter int(age)+factor, instead of age, it works perfectly. But the author says that python auto detects the variable type when you key it in. So in this case when I enter age=20, then age should become integer automatically correct?</p>
<p>Looking forward to any help!!</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">doc</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the <code>input()</code> function in python 3+ returns a string by converting whatever input you are given, much like <code>raw_input()</code> in python 2.x.</p>
<p>So, <code>age</code> is clearly a string.</p>
<p>You can't add a string with an integer, hence the error. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>can't convert int object to str implicity</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>int(age)</code> converts <code>age</code> to an integer, so it works in your case.</p>
<p>What you can do:</p>
<p>Use:</p>
<pre><code>age = int(input('Please enter your age: '))
</code></pre>
<p>To cast your input to an integer explicitly. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your problem is that input returns a string (since in general, input from the command line is text). You can cast this to an int to remove the error, as you have done. </p>
<p>Python only automatically detects the type of your variables in your program if they don't already have a type - it does not automatically convert typed variables to different types.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python does not know what operation you're trying to make, provided the '+' operator can be used both to concatenate strings and adding numbers.</p>
<p>So, it can't know if you're trying to do</p>
<pre><code>finalAge = int(age) + factor   #finalAge is an integer
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>finalAge = age + str(factor)   #finalAge is a string
</code></pre>
<p>You need to explicitly convert your variables so it won't be ambiguous.</p>
<p>In your case, int(age) returns an integer, which is the proper way to get what you want.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The tutorial you are using is for Python 2.x, but you are using Python 3.x. There are several important differences between the two, and you should use a version of Python that matches the tutorial. That said, relying on <code>input()</code> to convert values for you is a bad idea, even in a Py2.x tutorial...</span>
