<p>I have this simple file:</p>
<pre><code>1|2|234 A=Jim 33
1|2|765 A=Sam 44
1|2|561 A=Edy 55
</code></pre>
<p>I want to parse the file to get the following output:</p>
<pre><code>["1","2","Jim 33"]
["1","2","Sam 44"]
["1","2","Edy 55"]
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to split by "|", but the problem I am facing is how to split by "A=" or how to make the program recognizes "A=" and prints what is after it.</p>
<p>The algorithm that I have in mind is to iterate through each split item and check if the item contains the character "A=".  Not sure how to translate that into python code.  Any pythonic idea? </p>

<p>You can use regular expression, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split" rel="nofollow"><code>re.split</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.split('\|| A=', '1|2|234 A=Jim 33')
['1', '2', '234', 'Jim 33']
</code></pre>
<p><code>\|| A=</code> will match <code>|</code> or <code>A=</code>. The first <code>|</code> was escaped because <code>|</code> has special meaning in regular expression (meaning OR).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You could use a regex, like so: <code>(\d)\|(\d)\|(\d{3}) A=(.+)</code>, then get the groups.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does each line always have the same length for each part? Or might there be a line with, say, <code>AC=Alice</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for asking... The length of the lines are not consistent ... The sample of the file I put is simplistic ... Any idea how to tackle this issue? @TigerhawkT3</span>
