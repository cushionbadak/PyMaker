<p>I am trying to code a random path with several trajectories. My code is below and calculates a path, but the for loop does not create multiple different paths. Rather, it plots the same path n times on top of itself. I want to be a able to graph n number of different paths from within the same for loop, store the values in a single array, then graph them next to each other. Any idea what I am doing wrong?</p>
<pre><code>from numpy.random import randint
n = 1000
moves = randint(0, 2, size=n)
y = 0
x = [y]
n2 = 5

for t in range(n2):
    for i in moves:
        if i == 1:
            y = y + 1
        if i == 0:
            y = y - 1
        x.append(y)
    plt.plot(x)
    y = 0
    x = [y]
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to create a different path on each iteration of the loop then you should call <code>randint</code> inside of the loop, and calculate the path there</p>
<pre><code>from numpy.random import randint
n = 1000
n2 = 5

for t in range(n2):
    moves = randint(0, 2, size=n)
    y = 0
    x = [y]
    for i in moves:
        if i == 1:
            y = y + 1
        if i == 0:
            y = y - 1
        x.append(y)
    plt.plot(x)
    y = 0
    x = [y]
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to store all the computed paths, you can store them in a list or array:</p>
<pre><code>from numpy.random import randint
n = 1000
n2 = 5
paths = []  # use something like numpy.empty((n2, n)) to use an array

for t in range(n2):
    moves = randint(0, 2, size=n)
    y = 0
    x = [y]
    for i in moves:
        if i == 1:
            y = y + 1
        if i == 0:
            y = y - 1
        x.append(y)
    paths.append(x)  # use something like paths[t] = x with an array
    plt.plot(x)
    y = 0
    x = [y]
</code></pre>
<p>Then <code>paths[i]</code> would contain the i-th computed path, and <code>paths[i][j]</code> (or <code>paths[i, j]</code> with an array) the j-th position of the i-th path.</p>
<p>Yet another alternative would be to store all the paths in a linear list (or a one-dimensional array) one after the other, so <code>paths[:n]</code> would be the first path, then <code>paths[n:2*n]</code>, <code>paths[2*n:3*n]</code>, etc.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>moves = randint(0, 2, size=n)</code>: <code>randint</code> doesn't take that many arguments</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's the definition of that <code>randint</code>? It's not the usual one from the <code>random</code> module: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks- should have included the library import. apologies. updated the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! That helps a lot- runs perfect and I appreciate the explanation. Marked as answered.</span>
