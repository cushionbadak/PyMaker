<p>This is a generic question. </p>
<p>I wrote a piece of code that uses tensorflow to do the computation.</p>
<p>I want to print the time consumed during the execution of the code. </p>
<p>First I used: </p>
<pre><code>import time
start = time.time()
main()
print ("%s"  % (time.time() - start_time))
</code></pre>
<p>But I read that this is an inaccurate way to measure the execution time. </p>
<p>How to accurately measure the execution time of my program. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter" rel="noreferrer"><code>time.<strong>perf_counter</strong>()</code></a>. <code>perf_counter</code> is a "performance counter". It is the highest resolution time from an undefined starting point (Usually since the program started running) available on a platform. It is used for things measuring performance when subtracted from a subsequent call. It is a float in seconds.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.time" rel="noreferrer"><code>time.<strong>time</strong>()</code></a> is the seconds since the Unix epoch (1 January 1970), and may not be more precise than a second.</p>
<p>You can safely replace calls to <code>time.time()</code> with <code>time.perf_counter()</code>, as you are subtracting them.</p>
<pre><code>import time
start = time.perf_counter()
main()
elapsed = time.perf_counter() - start
print('Elapsed %.3f seconds.' % elapsed)
# The .3f is to round to 3 decimal places.
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">If you use ipython you can run your code <code>%timeit main()</code>. Otherwise how long does your code take to run? If it's at least 1 second time.time() is okay.</span>
