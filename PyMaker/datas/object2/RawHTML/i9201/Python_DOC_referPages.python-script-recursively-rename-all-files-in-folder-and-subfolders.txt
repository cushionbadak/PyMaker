<p>Hi I have  a number of different files that need to be renamed to something else. I got this far but I want to have it so that I can have many items to replace and their corresponding replacements rather than type each one out, run the code then retype it again. </p>
<p>UPDATE* Also I need the rename to only change part of the file not the whole thing so if there was a "Cat5e_1mBend1bottom50m2mBend2top-Aqeoiu31" it would just change it to "'Cat5e50m1mBED_50m2mBE2U-Aqeoiu31"</p>
<pre><code>import os, glob

#searches for roots, directory and files
for root,dirs, files in os.walk(r"H:\My Documents\CrossTalk\\"):
   for f in files:
       if f == "Cat5e_1mBend1bottom50m2mBend2top":#string you want to rename
          try:
             os.rename('Cat5e_1mBend1bottom50m2mBend2top', 'Cat5e50m1mBED_50m2mBE2U'))

<p>The first thing you'd need is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dictionary</code></a> for the replacements, then a small change in your code:</p>
<pre><code>import os, glob

name_map = {
     "Cat5e_1mBend1bottom50m2mBend2top": 'Cat5e50m1mBED_50m2mBE2U'
}

#searches for roots, directory and files
for root,dirs,files in os.walk(r"H:\My Documents\CrossTalk"):
   for f in files:
       if f in name_map:
          try:
             os.rename(os.path.join(root, f), os.path.join(root, name_map[f]))
          except FileNotFoundError, e:
          #except FileNotFoundError as e:  # python 3
             print(str(e))
</code></pre>
<p>In the name_map, the <code>key</code> (string to the left of "<code>:</code>") is the name of the file in your filesystem, and the <code>value</code> (string to the right of the "<code>:</code>") is the name you want to use.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the common replacement in the file name you will be making?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>if f in renames.keys()</code> =&gt; <code>if f in renames</code>, more pythonic, faster.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No that didn't work, it renamed all the files. I want only part of the file renamed. Im sorry if I am confusing you, please look at the update above</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Jean-FrançoisFabre i´m new in Python programming!!!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You wan´t to rename based on substring? If the filename contains de first substring then replace this substring in filename by the other? Sample:  if the key is "o1" and the value is "oPrinc1" and the filename is arquiv<b>o1</b>.txt ... The filename whil be renamed to "arquiv<b>oPrinc1</b>.txt"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi @VisualExstasy you see this after i edited the answer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that won't work: you have to join the <code>root</code> dir or <code>rename</code> will fail.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jean-FrançoisFabre Hey you helped me on my last script, got any suggestions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yep, thanks @Jean-FrançoisFabre</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rafael Barros that didn't work unfortunately</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Engineer updated.</span>
