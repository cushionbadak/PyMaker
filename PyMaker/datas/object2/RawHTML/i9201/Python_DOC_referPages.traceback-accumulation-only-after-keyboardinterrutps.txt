<p>This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import autopy
import time
import math
width, height = 400, 400
a, b = 200, 200
r = 150
def drawCicle():
    for x in range(0, 3):
        for angle in range(0, 360, 1):
            x = r * math.sin(math.radians(angle)) + a
            y = r * math.cos(math.radians(angle)) + b
            autopy.mouse.move(int(x),int(y))
            time.sleep(0.002)
def mouseMove():
    counter = 0
    while counter &lt; 4:
        drawCicle()
        counter += 1
    else:
        print('Drawing ' + str(counter) + ' circles')
        print('moving once more in 10 seconds...')
        counter = 0
        time.sleep(10)
        mouseMove()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mouseMove()
</code></pre>
<p>The strange thing is that the code runs just fine. I only get tracebacks after breaking my loop with a <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code>, spilling out accumulated tracebacks from each loop that ran like this:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 27, in &lt;module&gt;
    mouseMove()
  File "test.py", line 24, in mouseMove
    mouseMove()
  File "test.py", line 24, in mouseMove
    mouseMove()
  File "test.py", line 24, in mouseMove
    mouseMove()
  File "test.py", line 23, in mouseMove
    time.sleep(10)
KeyboardInterrupt
</code></pre>
<p>This specifically happens only if I break the code manually, can anyone shed some light as to what best practice I am ignoring?</p>

<p>If you want to see the output from your print statements immediately, just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>flush=True</code></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether output is buffered is usually determined by <em>file</em>, but if the <em>flush</em> keyword argument is true, the stream is forcibly flushed.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just use <code>print</code> with <code>flush=True</code> to see the print statements immediately.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm I am getting an invalid syntax flag with this <code>print('moving once more in 10 seconds...', flush = True)</code> do I need to do this in python3?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">edit: I set <code>flush=True</code> however I am still getting the same issue.</span>
