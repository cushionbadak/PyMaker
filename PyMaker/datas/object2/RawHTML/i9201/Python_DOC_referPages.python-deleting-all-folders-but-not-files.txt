<p>I am looking to write a piece of python code that deletes all folders and their contents, but does not delete individual files.<br/>
For example here are some files and folders contained in a directory (Folder B) along with the script file that does the deleting. How do I delete folderA, folderB,folderC,etc, but leave the files?  Thanks </p>
<pre><code>/Folder B 
    file.docx
    fileB.docx
    fileC.docx
    pythonDeleteScript.py
    folderA/
    folderB/
    folderC/
    folderD/
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>os.listdir()</code> to get the contents of the directory, <code>os.path.isdir(path)</code> to see if it is a folder, and if it is, <code>shutil.rmtree(path)</code> to delete the folder and all its content.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you look at <code>shutil</code> and the <code>os</code> modules? You can use the latter to scan a directory (and filter to only keep the directory entries in it), and the former to delete folder trees. SO isn't really intended as a code-writing service, and since you tagged this <code>shutil</code>, you're clearly aware of the module. Just take a look at <code>os</code>/<code>os.path</code> and try solving yourself.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@Copperfield: You'd want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.rmtree" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shutil.rmtree</code></a> to do this simply when the folders are non-empty. If you're on modern Python, it can simplify to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.scandir</code></a> (which covers the combined functionality of <code>os.listdir</code> and <code>os.path.isdir</code>, but more efficiently)+<code>shutil.rmtree</code>.</span>
