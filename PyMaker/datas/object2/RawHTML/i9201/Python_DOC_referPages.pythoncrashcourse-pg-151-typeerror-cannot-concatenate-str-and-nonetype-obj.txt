<p>In my book , Python Crash Course : This code is given but it gives an error.</p>
<pre><code>def make_pizza(*toppings):
    """Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""
    print("\nMaking a pizza with the following toppings:")
    for topping in toppings:
        print("- " + topping)

make_pizza(make_pizza("peperoni"))

make_pizza(make_pizza("mushroom",'green peppers','extra cheese'))
</code></pre>
<p>The traceback is as follows:</p>
<p>print("- " + topping)</p>
<p>TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objects</p>
<p><strong>Q. What is the NoneType object here ? Is it topping? If yes, why?</strong> </p>
<p>Even when i use <code>str()</code> around <code>topping</code> , It gives me a funny output:</p>
<pre><code>def make_pizza(*toppings):
"""Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""
print("\nMaking a pizza with the following toppings:")
for topping in toppings:
    print("- " + str(topping))

make_pizza(make_pizza("peperoni"))
make_pizza(make_pizza("mushroom",'green peppers','extra cheese'))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> </p>
<pre><code>Making a pizza with the following toppings:

- peperoni

Making a pizza with the following toppings: 

- None

Making a pizza with the following toppings:
- mushroom
- green peppers
- extra cheese

Making a pizza with the following toppings:
- None
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Q2. Why is displaying 2 outputs for each?
- one with the list of toppings 
-and one with None ?</strong> </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You shouldn't be passing the function to itself.</p>
<p>Replace these:</p>
<pre><code>make_pizza(make_pizza("peperoni"))
make_pizza(make_pizza("mushroom",'green peppers','extra cheese'))
</code></pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre><code>make_pizza("peperoni")
make_pizza("mushroom",'green peppers','extra cheese')
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>The reason that the error is happening is because you are passing the function <code>make_pizza</code>, which has no <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-return-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">return</a> value (it returns nothing), to itself.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, the inner function still executes completely. That is, the second <code>make_pizza</code> in each of your examples is running properly, which is why you're getting two outputs.</p>
<p>For the second function though, you're effectively trying to run:</p>
<pre><code>make_pizza(None)
</code></pre>
<p>Which of course leads to an error here:</p>
<pre><code>print("- " + topping)
</code></pre>
<p>because <code>topping</code> is <code>None</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The reason you sometimes saw <code>- None</code> in your output is because <code>str(None)</code> casts <code>None</code> to <code>"None"</code> (as in, a string containing the literal text <code>None</code>).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You are overcooking the pizza. Don't make the same pizza 2 times. This <code>make_pizza(make_pizza("peperoni"))</code> should be <code>make_pizza("peperoni")</code> :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh gosh! :D Sorry for that ! Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Accept theonlygusti's answer as he has clearly described what's happening in your script.</span>
