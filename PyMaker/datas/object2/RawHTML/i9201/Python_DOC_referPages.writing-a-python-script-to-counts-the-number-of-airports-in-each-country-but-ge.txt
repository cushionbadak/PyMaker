<p>I am new to python programming, I am trying to count the number of airports in each country. I am getting an error can someone help me resolve the following issue</p>
<pre><code>import csv
f = open("airports.dat")
for lists in csv.reader(f):
    airports = lists[1]
    countries = lists[3]

for air in airports:
    if air not in airports:
        airports[air]=1
    else:
        airports[air]+=1
print(airports)
</code></pre>
<p>Getting following error -</p>
<pre><code>TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-75-df427e17a15c&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()

      7 for air in airports:

      9         airports[air]=1

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> for <code>csv.reader</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return a reader object which will iterate over lines in the given <em>csvfile</em>.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Each row read from the csv file is returned as a list of strings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that <code>lists</code> in your code below will actually refer to a <em>list</em> (not plural!) of strings:</p>
<pre><code>for lists in csv.reader(f):
</code></pre>
<p>This means that you're assigning a <em>string</em> to <code>airports</code>:</p>
<pre><code>airports = lists[1]
</code></pre>
<p>And that in turn means this code is iterating over each character in a string:</p>
<pre><code>for air in airports:
</code></pre>
<p>Since a string is a sequence (of characters), you get a <code>TypeError</code> as you're attempting to access an element of this sequence with a non-integral subscript value (specifically, a single character):</p>
<pre><code>airports[air]+=1
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Your code and error are not in sync</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure <code>airports</code> is a dictionary and not a list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Show the first few lines of your file. That way it will be quicker to solve.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Under what circumstances do you expect <code>air not in airports</code> to be true? You're literally iterating over <code>for air in airports</code>, by definition, <code>air</code> will <b>always</b> be in <code>airports</code>.</span>
