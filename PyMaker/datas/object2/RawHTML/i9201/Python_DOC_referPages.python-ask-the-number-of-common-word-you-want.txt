<p>I'm quite new with the functionnalities of Python. And I need to know if someone can help me ?</p>
<p>My problem is : I have to create a program where someone can tap the number of most common words he/her wants. I don't know if I'm understandable. </p>
<p>But for example : 
I need to use "x=input("enter a number : ")
then the user can tap one number and the program will say : "here are the x most common word in your text". </p>
<p>Here my program : </p>
<pre><code>import re

from collections import Counter

words = re.findall("[a-zA-Z_]+", open("vie.txt").read()

count = Counter(words).most_common()

print(count)`
</code></pre>
<p>I know I can have the number I want by using most_common(), but I would like the program to ask it and not putting it in the code. </p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance</p>

<p>I think you're looking to, for example, return the 5 most common words if the user enters <code>5</code>.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter.most_common" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Counter.most_common</code></a> can actually do this for you, if you pass a number to it as an argument.</p>
<pre><code>import re
from collections import Counter

words = re.findall("[a-zA-Z_]+", open("vie.txt").read()

x = int(input('How many of the most common words would you like? '))

count = Counter(words).most_common(x)    
print(count)
</code></pre>
