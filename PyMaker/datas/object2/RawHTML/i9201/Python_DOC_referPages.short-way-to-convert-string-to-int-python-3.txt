<p>So in my code I usually do this to convert string to int, but I was wondering if there was a less clumsy way, because it feels kind of long.</p>
<pre><code>myInput = int(myInput)
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe this is just how it has to be, but thanks in advance if you have any ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Given that you're trying to convert a string to an int, I'd suggest you use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>int</code></a> function.</p>
<p>Your python code would look like:</p>
<pre><code>myInput = int(myInput)
</code></pre>
<p>This 3-letter function does what you need in a short way. Actually in other languages like Java, the syntax is almost twice as long.</p>
<p>Java example</p>
<pre><code>int myIntInput = Integer.parseInt(myInput);
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Maybe you were hoping for something like <code>myNumber = myInput.toInt</code>. But it is not currently possible to do it natively.  And funny enough, if you want to extract the integer part from a float-like string, you have to convert to <code>float</code> first, and then to <code>int</code>. Or esle you get <code>ValueError: invalid literal for int()</code>. 
So, this is a robust way: </p>
<pre><code>myInput = int(float(myInput))
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; nb="88.8"
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(nb)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '88.8'
&gt;&gt;&gt; int(float(nb))
88
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If it is user input, chances are the user inputted a string. So better catch the exception as well with try:</p>
<pre><code>UserInput = '88.8'
try:
    int(float(UserInput))
except:
    UserInput = 0
print(UserInput)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>str(myInput)</code> is converting <code>myInput</code> to a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#func-str" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string</a>, but the same syntax would be used to convert <code>myInput</code> to an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow noreferrer">int</a>, perhaps you mean <code>myInput = int(myInput)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah thanks my bad on the str()</span>
