<p>So I am trying to create a function that will let me simply call the function, and I give it 10 values, and a variable, and it will change that variable into one of the values provided, randomly.</p>
<pre><code>import random

place = "NA"

def randomize (value1, value2, value3, value4, value5, value6, value7, value8, value9, value10, variable):
global variable
variable  = random.choice([value1, value2, value3, value4, value5, value6, value7, value8, value9, value10])

randomize ("Dungeon", "Plains", "Castle", "Prison", "Tavern", "Armory", "Docks", "Warehouse", "ThroneRoom", "Bedroom", place)

print place
</code></pre>
<p>This however tells me the following:</p>
<pre><code>SyntaxError: name 'variable' is local and global
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python, you don't usually modify input parameters. I know this is standard in C, but it's easier to return the value and assign you variable to the output of the function instead:</p>
<pre><code>import random

def randomize(*values):
    return random.choice(values)

place = "NA"
print place

place = randomize("Dungeon", "Plains", "Castle", "Prison", "Tavern", "Armory", "Docks", "Warehouse", "ThroneRoom", "Bedroom")
print place
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>One way to do what you are trying to achieve is by <strong>Not passing your global variable <code>place</code> as parameter in your function</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>import random

place = "NA"

def randomize (value1, value2, value3, value4, value5, value6, value7, value8, value9, value10):      
   global place       
   place  = random.choice([value1, value2, value3, value4, value5, value6, value7, value8, value9, value10])

randomize ("Dungeon", "Plains", "Castle", "Prison", "Tavern", "Armory", "Docks", "Warehouse", "ThroneRoom", "Bedroom")

print place
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>As you have pointed out that you want to use this function for other variables as well, to do that, you can simply return <code>random.choice....</code> and call your <code>randomize</code> function to change the value of as many variables as you want.</p>
<p>following code snippet is used to change the value of two variables, one is global variable <code>place</code> and other is <code>myVar</code></p>
<pre><code>import random

place = "NA"

def randomize (value1, value2, value3, value4, value5, value6, value7, value8, value9, value10):
    return random.choice([value1, value2, value3, value4, value5, value6, value7, value8, value9, value10])

place = randomize ("Dungeon", "Plains", "Castle", "Prison", "Tavern", "Armory", "Docks", "Warehouse", "ThroneRoom", "Bedroom")

myVar = randomize ("Dungeon", "Plains", "Castle", "Prison", "Tavern", "Armory", "Docks", "Warehouse", "ThroneRoom", "Bedroom")

print place   
print myVar
</code></pre>

<p>For <code>1, 2, 3, ... n</code> values you should use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#list" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list</a>. You also need to write less code, so it scales better. And you should try to avoid <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17765560/avoid-using-global-without-confusing-new-programming-students-in-python">global variables</a>... Reasons why you can find <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19158339/why-are-global-variables-evil">in the global internet</a>. For this example you even could save a method definition.</p>
<pre><code>import random
places = ["Dungeon", "Plains", "Castle", "Prison", "Tavern", "Armory", "Docks",
          "Warehouse", "ThroneRoom", "Bedroom"]  # list with n elements...
place = random.choice(places)
print place

<span class="comment-copy">Well why do you pass <code>variable</code> as <b>a parameter</b> and mark it as <b>global</b> in the same method?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because the variable that I am trying to change is global. But the function will be used to change different variables, so I have to tell the function which variable to change.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>global</code> does not work that way, you pass global the <b>identifier</b>, so it will <b>always</b> change a variable with the name <code>variable</code>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please provide a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal,Complete and Verifiable example</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well is there a way to make this work, or should I just not do it as a function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked, thank you so much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, but this function would be used to change other variables than just "place", so I need to tell the function which variable to change.</span>
