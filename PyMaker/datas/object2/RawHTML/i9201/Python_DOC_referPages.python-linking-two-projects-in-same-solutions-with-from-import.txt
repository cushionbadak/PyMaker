<p>In the same solution I have my project which imports SQL and my game project.
Unfortunately when I type "from highscore import *" it doesn't recognize it in the game file. 
Am I missing something important?</p>

<p>It is considered bad practice to use <code>import *</code>.
You're better off importing only the things you need with <code>from highscore import score</code> or <code>import highscore</code>.</p>

<p>In general, don’t use from modulename import *. Doing so clutters the importer’s namespace, and makes it much harder for linters to detect undefined names.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I've thought about that but the problem is it doesn't recognize 'highscore' while it's in the same solution.</span>
