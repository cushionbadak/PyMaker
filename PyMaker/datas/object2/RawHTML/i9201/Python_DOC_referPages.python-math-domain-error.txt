<p>I am making a program that solves the quadratic equation and prints the roots. Before I get to the main program, I am just trying to make the square root work. The error I am getting says "math domain error". If someone could give me some help as to why it is not working that would be great. </p>
<pre><code>import math

    a = int(sys.argv[1])
    b = int(sys.argv[2])
    c = int(sys.argv[3])
    x1 = int
    x2 = int
    #  variables into solving equation and assign answers
    print(math.sqrt((b**2)-(4*a*c)))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>It's known that<code>sqrt</code> gives that error when you try to use it with a negative number. </p>
<p>The result probably is a complex number, and as stated in the comments by 098799, <em>"math.sqrt won't give you complex numbers"</em>.</p>
<p>Instead of using:</p>
<pre><code>import math
print(math.sqrt((b**2)-(4*a*c)))
</code></pre>
<p>Try using:</p>
<pre><code>import cmath
print(cmath.sqrt((b**2)-(4*a*c)))
</code></pre>
<p>It works with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmath.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">cmath</a>, because it provides access to mathematical functions for complex numbers.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Probably you input values that evaulate to negative number. <code>math.sqrt</code> won't give you complex numbers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The lines <code>x1 = int</code> and <code>x2 = int</code> don't do anything useful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so what does cmath mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Complex mathematics, in which sqrt (-1) == i (or j as some say). But given the fact you're just learning quadratic equations I don't think you'll need to learn complex numbers now. You just should test that b**2 - 4*a*c &gt;= 0. If it's &gt; 0, you'll find 2 solutions, if it's == 0 you'll find one solution. And indeed x1 = int and x2 = int won't get you anywhere.</span>
