<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>so I'm trying to remove numbers from a string using a list of numbers from 0,9. I've been trying to figure this out for quite a while now but I haven't gotten far with it, i'll put the code down here, hopefully someone can help me with this. I don't wan't to use ways that i'm not familiar with like lambda or something I saw earlier here on stackoverflow.</p>
<pre><code>string = input("Type a string: ")

numbers = ["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"]
start = 0

for i in range(len(string)):
    if(string[i] == numbers[start]):
        string.remove(i)
    else:
        print("Banana")

print(string)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You shouldn't iterate &amp; try to change the object while iterating. This is complicated by the fact that strings are immutable (new reference is created when string content changes). Well, not a good solution, and not performant either even if you could make that work.</p>
<p>A pythonic &amp; simple way of doing this would be:</p>
<pre><code>new_string = "".join([x for x in string if not x.isdigit()])
</code></pre>
<p>(list comprehension which creates a new string keeping all the characters but the numerical ones)</p>
<p>could be "translated" for the non-listcomp speakers as:</p>
<pre><code>l = []
for x in string:
    if not x.isdigit():
       l.append(x)
new_string = "".join(l)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>string = string.remove(i)</code>? Strings are immutable, they can't be changed in place, so anything that changes them returns a new string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd remove the square brackets. Generator expression will suffice and save some memory.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright, this is something else i saw on here but i don't quite understand how it works, could you explain to me how ( x for in x in string if not x.isdigits() ) works?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kobbi You should read some of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation on the topic</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@schwobaseggl: no it won't save memory. <code>join</code> needs to know the size, so it will build a list if not passed one. That'll be only slower: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37782066/list-vs-generator-comprehension-speed-with-join-function" title="list vs generator comprehension speed with join function">stackoverflow.com/questions/37782066/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, will do.</span>
