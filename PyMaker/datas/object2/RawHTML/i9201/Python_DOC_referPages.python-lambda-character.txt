<p>I am trying to write a function that includes a parameter lambda as a character. However, lambda is a tool in python so how do I write lambda as a character in python without having it be the tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want a function such as</p>
<pre><code>def try_lambda (lambda):
    print lambda
</code></pre>
<p>... you cannot do this.  <strong>lambda</strong> is a reserved word to introduce a lambda function, and you cannot use it for something else.</p>
<p>If, instead, you want to use the Greek character:</p>
<pre><code>def try_lambda (位):
    print (位)
</code></pre>
<p>... then you <em>can</em> do this.  The above code works in Python 3.*, which defaults to UTF-8</p>
<p>Under Python 2.*, you have to declare your program as using a different character set (the default is an English-centric character set).  See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for encoding details.</p>
<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

def try_lambda (位):
    print 位
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you be more specific? I am not understanding what you mean.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand your question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">are you saying you want to have a parameter that is named <code>lambda</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>lambda</code> is a reserved word in Python, and cannot be used as an ordinary identifier. But what to do mean "lambda as a character?"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga I think he means the triangular symbol</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean "declare your program as using a different character set"? Python (3 at least) supports writing source code in UTF-8 by default, AFAIK.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga Add <code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-</code> at the top of the file. The default set is ASCII.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DYZ what do you mean "the default set?". AFAIK, Python defaults to UTF-8, at least on Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga: good point, both you and DYZ.  I was leaving this to OP to look up, but let's do it well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga "Python will default to ASCII as standard encoding if no other  encoding hints are given." <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263</a></span>
