<p>I am currently working on an automation task. I have arrived at a part of the script where I need confirmation from the user to continue. For example the script is automatically entering some values in Selenium for the user however I need confirmation from the user that these are the correct variables. Let's say I want to output this list into the command prompt:</p>
<pre><code>['ESPN', 'ESPN Radio', 'ESPNews', 'ESPN2', 'ESPN3']
</code></pre>
<p>The user then can enter <code>'ESPN2'</code> and my script will continue with the rest of its processes. How would I go about implementing the first portion of this? I believe the second portion of this task would involve using <code>sys.argv[0]</code> to correctly store the value the user enters back. However the issue is with the first part, how do I implement this so that my script knows to pause and wait for the user input? Thanks!</p>

<p>IIUC you need to wait for the user until it matches your list.</p>
<p>Also make sure that you go through below link and reads the basics <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/</a></p>
<pre><code>lst=['ESPN', 'ESPN Radio', 'ESPNews', 'ESPN2', 'ESPN3']
print lst


while True:
    value=raw_input("enter a value from list\n")
    if value not in ('ESPN', 'ESPN Radio', 'ESPNews', 'ESPN2', 'ESPN3'):
        print("Not an appropriate choice.")
    else:
        print("Continue to other modules")
        break
</code></pre>
<p>output </p>
<pre><code>    ['ESPN', 'ESPN Radio', 'ESPNews', 'ESPN2', 'ESPN3']

    enter a value from list
    xx
    Not an appropriate choice.

    enter a value from list
    yy
    Not an appropriate choice.

    enter a value from list
    ESPN
    Continue to other modules

<span class="comment-copy">If you use python 3, replace <code>raw_input()</code> with <code>input()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm using Python 2.7 but thanks. I thought I needed to use <code>sys</code> for this, I guess the only thing I need it for is to store the value they enter, is that correct?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes you are right. execute the script and let me know if this behaving as expected</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yep it all worked out thanks!</span>
