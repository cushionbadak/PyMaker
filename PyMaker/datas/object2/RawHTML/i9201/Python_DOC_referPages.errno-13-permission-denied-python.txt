<p>In python, I am currently experimenting with what I can do with <code>open</code> command. I tried to open a file, and got an error message. Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>open(r'C:\Users\****\Desktop\File1')
</code></pre>
<p>My error message was:</p>
<pre><code>PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'C:\\Users\\****\\Desktop\\File1'
</code></pre>
<p>I looked on the website to try and find some answers and I saw a post where somebody mentioned <code>chmod</code>. 1. I'm not sure what this is and 2. I don't know how to use it, and thats why I've come here.</p>

<p>Your user don't have the right permissions to <code>read</code> the file, since you used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>open()</code></a> without specifying a mode.</p>
<p>Since you're using Windows, you should read a little more about <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754344(v=ws.11).aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">File and Folder Permissions</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to play with your file permissions, you should <code>right-click</code> it, choose <code>Properties</code> and select <code>Security</code> tab.</p>
<p>Or if you want to be a little more hardcore, you can run your script as admin.</p>

<p>The problem here is your user doesn't have proper <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc754344(v=ws.11)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rights/permissions</a> to open the file this means that you'd need to grant some administrative privileges to your python ide before you run that command.</p>
<p>As you are a windows user you just need to <strong><em>right click on python ide =&gt; select option 'Run as Administrator'</em></strong> and then run your command.</p>
<p>And if you are using the command line to run the codes, do the same <strong><em>open the command prompt with admin rights</em></strong>. Hope it helps</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you should do research into what it is and how to use it? (Hint: you'll find that <code>chmod</code> is for Unix-style systems, not Windows, as you seem to be using. You'll have to keep Googling.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, This helped :)</span>
