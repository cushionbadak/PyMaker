<p>I developed a simple Python app on Debian and I don't want to share my code.
The user will be on Windows.
I tried to use py_compile but the *.pyc file is not working on the other machine (Windows), giving a Bad magic number error.
Probably the error is due to a different Python 3 version, but the code is full compatible with any Python 3 version.</p>
<p>So, the question is: how can I compile a script in *.pyc format that is not checking the Python version in a so strictly way?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Maybe you can try with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/compileall.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/compileall.html</a>. You can do something like this <code>python -m compileall file.py</code></p>

<p>If you want to distribute your app easily without too much hazzle, just use one of the multiple available <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/shipping/freezing/#freezing-your-code-ref" rel="nofollow noreferrer">freezing tools</a>, you'll get it running on multiple platforms easily without spending too much time.</p>
