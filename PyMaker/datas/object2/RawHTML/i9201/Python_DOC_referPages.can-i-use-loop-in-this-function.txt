<p>I'm creating a function for a game which includes a board and words. I have designed this function and I don't really know if I could use a loop or a list method to run it correctly.
This is the function I am creating:</p>
<pre><code>def make_str_from_column(board, column_index):
    """ (list of list of str, int) -&gt; str

    Return the characters from the column of the board with index column_index
    as a single string.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; make_str_from_column([['A', 'N', 'T', 'T'], ['X', 'S', 'O', 'B']], 1)
    'NS'
    """
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have a couple of options for getting the letters.  You could use a simple loop</p>
<pre><code>ret = []
for sublist in board:
    ret.append(sublist[column_index])
</code></pre>
<p>You could simplify that into a list comprehension</p>
<pre><code>[sublist[column_index] for sublist in board]
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can use <code>zip</code>, which will actually make each column, and then you can choose among them.</p>
<pre><code>list(zip(*board))[column_index]
</code></pre>
<p>Personally, I would choose the list comprehension.</p>
<p>Once you have that however, you should use <code>''.join</code> to combine the list of strings into a single string</p>
<pre><code>return ''.join([sublist[column_index] for sublist in board])
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">As is, your question is very hard to understand. Where is the actual function implementation? What do you mean by list method? (I'm assuming, you mean a list <b>comprehension</b>) Also, StackOverflow is only for coding questions and we rarely take on things that already work. Questions regarding improvement should be asked on <a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com">codereview.stackexchange.com</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think a list comprehension is better too. But in this case I have to use functions that I have created earlier. Under this conditions zip could be used  anyway? or use it could be more difficult? PD: I didn't know zip option.</span>
