<p>How can I make PyCharm's (or any IDE's) autocomplete functionality to suggest me b, c, d and e as attributes for lala().
can i define a custom list somewhere?</p>

<p><strong>Solution for Python 3</strong></p>
<p>You can just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Union" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Union type</a> if it's possible to list all possibilities.</p>
<p>I have added <code>C</code> class because it's not in <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> class hierarchy so the example will be more clear and holistic.</p>
<pre><code>from typing import Union


class A(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.b = 5
        self.c = 0

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        self.e = 10
        self.d = 11

class C:
    def __init__(self):
        self.f = 12

def jojo(li):
    return li[1]

def lala() -&gt; Union[A, B, C]:
    a = [A(), B(), C()]
    b = jojo(a)
    return b

lala()

<p>For PYTHON 2</p>
<pre><code>class A(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.b = 5
        self.c = 0

class B(A):
    def __init__(self):
        self.e = 10
        self.d = 11

def jojo(li):
    return li[1]

<p>Union doesn't work so only 1 class can be passed</p>

<span class="comment-copy">isinstance doesnt work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">isinstance does not work, since <i>b</i> (element index 1) is an instance of <i>B</i>, not <i>A</i>. Since lala is not a multiple inheriting class, but just has a list of data with instances, I find the demand for a successful autocomplete somewhat ambitious. For which language/IDE combination did you succeed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't succeed.  Looking for Python in PyCharm or Eclipse. Above code of course is a simplified explanation of the problem I'm facing, I removed the isinstance, since it's not working anyway</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ah dang it, using Python 2.7 :-) any other suggestion?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">some research brought me to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#suggested-syntax-for-python-2-7-and-straddling-code" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/â€¦</a> Thx for the suggestion</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its not working entirely as i wanted but it s already halfway there. I'll file my answer as a separate answer and select your guidance as the correct one</span>
