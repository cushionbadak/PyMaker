<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to code an application that help me to determine class of IP and edit on it like if I'm using IP class a "10.0.0.0" with subnet mask 255.0.0.0 I want to let user input his IP AND SUBNET MASK as above and I make an equation to inform him how many IPs he can use, during my search I got this code </p>
<pre><code>import sys

sys.stdout.write("Enter IP address: ")
sys.stdout.flush()
ip = sys.stdin.readline()
print("you entered: " + ip)
</code></pre>
<p>but when I use it I couldn't make any edit on the ip by that code </p>
<pre><code>import sys

sys.stdout.write("Enter IP address: ")
sys.stdout.flush()
ip = sys.stdin.readline()
a = ip + 1
print("you entered: " + ip + "and your IP will be : " + a)
</code></pre>
<p>it shows that error : TypeError: must be str, not int</p>
<p>finally I want to make that number is applicable to edit on it, and kindly explain you're code to help me understand it correctly.
thanks in advance </p>

<p>With Python 3.3 you can make use of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ipaddress â€” IPv4/IPv6 manipulation library</a></p>
<pre><code>import sys
import ipaddress

sys.stdout.write("Enter IP address: ")
sys.stdout.flush()
ip = sys.stdin.readline().strip()   # remove the trailing '\n'
assigned_ip = ipaddress.IPv4Address(ip) + 1
print("You entered: " + ip + " and your IP will be: " + str(assigned_ip))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Enter IP address: 192.168.1.0
You entered: 192.168.1.0 and your IP will be: 192.168.1.1
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>sys.stdin.readline()</code> return string. You can not add an integer (<code>1</code>) to string (<code>ip</code>). And why don't you use <code>input()</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9539006/python-increment-ipaddress">this question</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">so what should I use instead sys.stdin.readline() ?  and If I used input how can I store xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx in it ? I know input should retrieve a type of variable like int or string or float ...etc</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use regular <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer">input()</a> function. You don't have to, it is not an issue, but I don't see why would you use <code>sys.stdin.readline()</code> instead of <code>input()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I used it as I got it, I saw someone use that code to store an IP in a variable there for I used it, can you give me an example about how can I use a regular input() and how can I store an IP in a variable to edit on it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you are such a genius I wanna give you more than million like :) I used your code and It works correctly, thank you so much.</span>
