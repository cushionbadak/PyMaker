<p>If I wanted to say something for a while loop such as: <code>while time is greater than or equal to 0</code>, would it simply be written as <code>while time &gt; or == 0</code>? Or is there no way to do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>while time &gt;= 0</code> (equivalent to <code>while time &gt; 0 or time == 0</code>)</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 0 &gt;= 0
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 &gt;= 0
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; -1 &gt;= 0
False
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It would be:</p>
<pre><code>while time &gt;= 0:
    pass
    #here be dragons
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Counting in Python example:</p>
<pre><code>time = 0 
while time &lt; 100: 
    time = time + 1 
    print time
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The relation "is greater than or equal to" is treated as a single statement, not an alternation of two disjoint  ones. The presence of the word "or" in the English reading doesn't imply that the operator <code>or</code> is involved in the translation to Python.   In mathematics, this "greater than or equal" relationship is written with the symbol â‰¥, but usually in programming languages, and certainly in Python, it's written <code>&gt;=</code>.</span>
