<p>I need to write  a code for the given problem.</p>
<p>I'm provided with a word and I need to find all the possible combination of it that matches with a given list of words in a file.</p>
<p>Here's my code. Can I make it much better. I'm sure it can be. Please suggest.</p>
<pre><code>dict = {}

<p>You could use <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#set" rel="nofollow"><code>set</code></a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict" rel="nofollow"><code>collections.defaultdict</code></a> to simplify this some:</p>
<pre><code>import collections

# If you try to look up a key that doesn't exist in `words`,
# it will create a new `set()` for that key and return it.

<span class="comment-copy">This question appears to be off-topic because you want a review of working code. It is suitable for <a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/">Code Review</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is your own personal opinion. I dont want a review. I want a better solution than this. I would've asked for a review in case when it was not working.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user1162512 This is certainly a code review type question. Specifically, from the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/about">about</a>: "Avoid questions that are primarily opinion-based, or that are likely to generate discussion rather than answers." Asking for general suggestions to make the code better does not lend itself to definitive answers.</span>
