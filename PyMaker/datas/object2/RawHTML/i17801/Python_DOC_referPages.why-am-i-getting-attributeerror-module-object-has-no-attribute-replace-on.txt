<p>contri[0][5] and [6] are strings that contain numbers formatted as 1,000.00.  I'm removing the commas before I cast the strings as floats in order to add them to totalR, which is a float.  (Created as totalR = 0.0)  I also tried using Decimal, but the error happened there too.  I did "import string".  The program fails with error:</p>
<pre><code>File "mine.py", line 43, in fillDonorData
totalR = totalR + (float(string.replace(contri[0][5],",","")) + float(string.replace(contri[0][6],",","")))
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'replace'

<p>Methods in the <code>string</code> module have been deprecated for years. You should call <code>replace</code> directly on your string, or <code>contri[6]</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I have used '10,000' instead of 'contri[0][5]' and 'contri[0][6]' in your code and everything works fine. I am on Python 2.7. If you are trying this on python 3 you should read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9452108/how-to-use-string-replace-in-python-3-x">this</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm assuming you're on Python 3.x? If so, you should include that tag in your question. Also, you should paste the entire traceback, not just the error itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In 2.x, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#deprecated-string-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Deprecated string functions</a> still work despite being deprecated. In 3.x, most of them (including <code>replace</code>) no longer exist. However, there are still plenty of non-deprecated functions, constants, and classes in <code>string</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>string</code> is a builtin module. But this is correct, you would have to reload if changes are made.</span>
