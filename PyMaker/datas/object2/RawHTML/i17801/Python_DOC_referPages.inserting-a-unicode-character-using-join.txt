<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have columns in a data table that I need to join. One column consists of values and the other of corresponding error values, for example:</p>
<pre><code>50.21  0.03
43.23  0.06
23.65  1.20
12.22  0.06
11.25  2.21
</code></pre>
<p>What I'd like to do is, for each row join the columns along with a +/-, but the clean unicode character (U+00B1). I've never tried to use unicode characters in python before, so I'm sorta stumped.</p>
<p>If my <code>.join()</code> looks like</p>
<pre><code>"&lt;unicode here&gt;".join(item)
</code></pre>
<p>how exactly do I let python know I want to use a unicode character.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to join with unicode, use a unicode string:</p>
<pre><code>u'\u00b1'.join(item)
</code></pre>
<p>This does presume that <code>item</code> is a sequence of <em>strings</em>; byte strings or unicode strings. Byte strings will be coerced to unicode for you, with the ASCII codec.</p>
<p>It'd be better to explicitly turn your values into unicode strings, that way you can control what encoding is used.</p>
<p>Demo with <code>str</code> values:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; items = [r.split() for r in '''\
... 50.21  0.03
... 43.23  0.06
... 23.65  1.20
... 12.22  0.06
... 11.25  2.21
... '''.splitlines()]
&gt;&gt;&gt; items
[['50.21', '0.03'], ['43.23', '0.06'], ['23.65', '1.20'], ['12.22', '0.06'], ['11.25', '2.21']]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in items:
...     print u'\u00b1'.join(item)
... 
50.21±0.03
43.23±0.06
23.65±1.20
12.22±0.06
11.25±2.21
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">As a side note, if you want to start learning Unicode in Python now, you should consider switching to Python 3.x first. Learning Unicode in 3.x is a lot easier (and a lot different, so half of what you learn for 2.x today won't even be right in 3.x).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, I've been thinking of making the switch. This is one more reason to do so I guess. Thanks for the suggestion.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While you're at it, reading the Unicode HOWTO for <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">2.7</a> and for <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">3.x</a> is probably worth doing. Andrew Kuchling is good at explaining things, and there are nice links to other resources as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert ...currently reading exactly that. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Awesome. My pre-unicode script is very similar to yours, however when I try to <code>print</code> the <code>u\u00b1'</code> I get this: <code>UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xb1' in position 5: ordinal not in range(128)</code>. Is this due to me not explicitly turning my values into unicode strings?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matt: <i>Printing</i> unicode strings is a whole other problem on top of creating them. (Especially if you're on Windows.) The problem here is that you've created a valid Unicode string, and Python is trying to encode it appropriately for your console—but it can't figure out what character set your console wants, so it's falling back to <code>'ascii'</code>. And there is no ASCII character for <code>±</code>. You should probably accept this answer and create a new question (or, better, searching for similar questions, because there are surely multiple dups here).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matt: But first, to make absolutely sure that everything other than printing works, you may want to try (a) running the script in IDLE (which should be able to handle Unicode output) and/or (b) explicitly encoding to UTF-8 and writing the result to a file (or using <code>io.open</code> or <code>codecs.open</code> to create a UTF-8 file and writing the <code>unicode</code> to that) and verifying that the file looks right when viewed as a UTF-8 text file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matt: Related: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/888406">Make Emacs use UTF-8 with Python Interactive Mode</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matt: Aha, that's exactly what it is. <code>python-mode</code>'s Python shell can interact with MULE, but run <code>python</code> manually inside <code>shell</code>'s shell can't. You can usually work around that by <code>export PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF-8</code> and <i>also</i> setting the appropriate locale variables for your platform (<code>LC_ALL</code> or <code>LANG</code> should be enough) to something UTF-8-friendly, before launching Python. (Assuming you're on a UTF-8 underlying terminal, or in an X window and have MULE configured correctly.)</span>
