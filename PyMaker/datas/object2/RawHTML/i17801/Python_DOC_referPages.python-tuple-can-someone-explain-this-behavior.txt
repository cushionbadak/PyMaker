<p>I found some questions asking about <code>TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment</code> on SO, but still, I'm confused about this:</p>
<p>Consider the code snippet:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = ([],[])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0].append(1)       # 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
([1], [])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0] += [2]

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#5&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    a[0] += [2]
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment   # 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
([1, 2], [])   # 3
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>tuples are immutable, but <code>1</code> successfully changed its value.Why?(I know I dont really understand python immutability..)</li>
<li>If <code>1</code> is accepted, what's the reason that <code>2</code> raise <code>TypeError</code>?</li>
<li>In <code>3</code>, <code>a</code> gets modified, then what's the point raising a <code>TypeError</code>?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you </p>

<p>It's because tuples are immutable, but it can contain mutable data types( a <em>list</em> in ur case) as an element. </p>
<p>Your tuple <code>a = ([], [])</code> is a tuple of lists. So that's why you were able to append data to a[0] - which is a list. </p>
<p>In this:</p>
<pre><code>a[0] += 2 
</code></pre>
<p>You were attempting to change the value of the tuple which raises the exception TypeError (due to the use of '=' assignment operator)</p>
<p>In three, the list got concatenated due to the use of '+' operator.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">For the first, see <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/â€¦</a> -- basically, "tuples are immutable" only means "you cannot add, remove or replace objects in a tuple", not "objects contained in a tuple are immutable too".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">-1 Your answer does not address how <code>a[0] += 2</code> attempts to modify the tuple, because naively, I would expect that to only modify the list object. <code>a[0]</code> is different from <code>a</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">a[0] = a[0] + [2], here the right hand side completed without an error(concatenation occured), and when the trying to assign the result to a[0] you are actually assigning a value to tuple, so it's throw an error. I might be wrong. But this is what I understood.</span>
