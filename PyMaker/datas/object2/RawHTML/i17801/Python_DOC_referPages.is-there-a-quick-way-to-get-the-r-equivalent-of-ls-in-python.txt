<p>I'm new to Python and normally use R, and regularly use <code>ls()</code> to get a vector of all the objects in my current environment, is there something that does the same thing quickly in Python?</p>

<p>You're probably looking for <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir" rel="noreferrer"><code>dir</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without arguments, return the list of names in the current local scope. With an argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for that object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may not be entirely obvious at first, but when you're at global scope (as you usually are at the command-line interpreter), the "current local scope" is the global scope (in this case, of the <code>__main__</code> module). So, this will return all the variables and functions you've defined, all the modules you've imported, and a few things that get attached to every module or just to <code>__main__</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3.3
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir()
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__']
&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 2+3
&gt;&gt;&gt; dir()
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', 'i', 'sys']
</code></pre>
<p>This is always the same thing as <code>sorted(locals().keys())</code>, but <code>dir()</code> is a lot easier to type. And of course it's nicely parallel with <code>dir(sys)</code> to get the things defined by the <code>sys</code> module, <code>dir(i)</code> to get the attributes of that integer object <code>5</code>, etc.</p>
