<p>I'm working on understanding how to use the delimiter function with CSV. The code below is what I have so far, but what I am trying to do is to get each item in a separate cell for the CSV file. I  tried this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13405485/undestanding-csv-module-delimiter">example</a>...</p>
<pre><code>import csv
import datetime
# imports modules

now = datetime.datetime.now()
# define current time when file is executed

how = str(raw_input("How are you doing?"))
why = str(raw_input("Why do you feel that way?"))
scale_of_ten = int(raw_input("On a scale of 1-10. With 10 being happy and 1 being sad. How happy are you?"))
#creates variables for csv file

x = [now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"),how,why,scale_of_ten]
# creates list for variables to be written in

f = csv.writer(open("happy.csv","wb"))
# creates f which makes a happy.csv type wb
w = csv.writer(f, delimiter = ',')
w.writerow([x])
</code></pre>
<p>I get this error below from running the code:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "journal.py", line 18, in &lt;module&gt;
    w = csv.writer(f, delimiter = ',')
TypeError: argument 1 must have a "write" method
</code></pre>
<p>How would I get my inputs into separate cells instead of one?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're trying to create a csv.writer from a csv.writer; you should include the delimiter argument when making f and just use that.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>csv.writer</code> expects a file like object.  It looks like you try to create the writer twice.  Try this...</p>
<pre><code>import csv
data = [1, 2, 3, 4]
with open('file.csv', 'w') as f:
    wtr = csv.writer(f)  # use the file as the argument to writer
    wtr.writerow(data)
    f.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are almost there. Basically f should simply be a file object or fid in my case.You give the writer method another csv.writer object.   The csv.writer first parameter should be a file ID, such as acquired by the open('new.csv','w')</p>
<pre><code>fid = open('new.csv','w')
w = csv.writer(fid,delimiter=',')

#write to file
fid.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't need the 'w' variable, just do this:</p>
<pre><code>f = csv.writer(open("happy.csv", "wb"), delimiter=',')
f.writerow([x])
</code></pre>
</div>
