<p>I am trying to create a random number generator for 3 different dice and I cannot find the solution to what to continue with.</p>

if question == 4:

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You want use: random.randint(Min,Max)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What language are you asking about (always put this information in your question â€” include the version)? Have you written any more code? If this is where you're stuck, perhaps you should read through <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the tutorial</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the program is in python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Put that information in your question. Click "edit" beneath your question to edit your question. Include the version. You can also tag it with the language/version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok fine now can you help me with my question please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ive done that but i just want a basic number genorator please any help there?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean in "basic number"?  this code will give you 1,2,3 or 4</span>
<span class="comment-copy">basic number for example import random # import the random class. If you don't do this, python doesn't know what to do number = int(random.randrange(0,100)) #generate a random number between 1 and 100  your_guess = int(input(" I'm thinking of a number. Can you guess what it is? Enter a number between 1 and 100: "))          while (your_guess != number):</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well, I realy don't understand what you want... but i'll try to write all of the program for you: <code>import random dice = int(raw_input("What sided dice woud you like to roll? 4, 6 or 12?")) while dice !=0:     print random.randint(1,dice)     dice = int(raw_input("What sided dice woud you like to roll? 4, 6 or 12? press 0 to stop."))</code></span>
