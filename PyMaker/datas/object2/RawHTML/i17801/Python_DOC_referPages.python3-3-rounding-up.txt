<p>In Python I would like to divide two numbers and if the answer is not an integer I want the number to be rounded up to the number above.<br/>
For example 100/30 not to give 33.3 but to give 4.
Can anyone suggest how to do this? Thanks. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can use the ceil function in math library that python has, but also you can take a look why in a logical sense</p>
<pre><code>a = int(100/3) # this will round down to 3
b = 100/3 # b = 33.333333333333336, a and b are not equal

so we can generalize into the following

def ceil(a, b):
    if (b == 0):
        raise Exception("Division By Zero Error!!") # throw an division by zero error
    if int(a/b) != a/b:
        return int(a/b) + 1
    return int(a/b)
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.ceil" rel="noreferrer"><code>math.ceil()</code></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.ceil(100/33)
4
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What about <code>-100/33</code>? <code>-3</code> or <code>-4</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And what about <code>10/9.9999</code>? <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you this has worked perfectly and I now also understand the logic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3130576 one extra condition you might wanna check is that, b can't be 0, i forgot to do it so let me update it again :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that if the question was about Python 2, you'd need to cast the result: <code>int(math.ceil(float(100)/33))</code>. This was changed from 2 to 3.</span>
