<p>Ways to condense these?</p>

<p>I'm mainly just unsure of how to stop the repetition with changing variables. Thanks.</p>

<p>Note I've also made it a format string for better readability.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The obvious solution would seem to be stop using changing variables and use multi-dimensional arrays instead?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For starters, you could delete the first five lines entirely, since none of those variables are used anywhere else in the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kevin: It's obviously just a snippet and you don't know the context. Just assume the variables are used in the actual program</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kevin - This is just a segment of the entire code it is used to count  the randomized variables in 'rows'.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you explain how this works? Also, it says:      AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'format'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I had the parens wrong. <code>.format</code> is a method call to the last string in the tuple, not to the tuple itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And <code>["[X]","[X]","[X]","[X]","[X]", ...]</code> with <code>["[X]"] * 5 + [...]</code>.</span>
