<p>I have a website which is built with django.</p>
<p>Problem: we have &gt;50 pages currently and exactly identical footer HTML code on each of those pages. I am getting tired of having to edit all those pages when adding a little change to the footer.</p>
<p>Possible solution: inserting the footer directly in the django base page.</p>
<p>Potential problems: if I insert the footer in the base page, all the individual JS scripts between the footer and the  tag would be lost - clearly those scripts are page specific. So could I have the specific JS scripts BEFORE the footer? This would allow the footer to go in the base nice and easily, but I'm not sure I can do this. Would moving the scripts before the footer be wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Yes, you can have scripts above the HTML footer. This has a potential downside that you would have to wait for the scripts to be fetched and ran before your footer HTML is rendered - but that's unlikely to be a problem unless your scripts are very large.</p>
<p>However, there is a simple solution to avoid this. Just have something like this at the bottom of your base template</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;!-- footer HTML --&gt;
    {% block page_js %}{% endblock %}
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And then in each individual page you can include something like this (with as many on-page and/or externally-loaded scripts as necessary):</p>
<pre><code>{% block page_js %}
&lt;script&gt;// some custom JS for this page only&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="js/for/this/page.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
{% endblock %}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can put your footer HTML into its own file and then add the <code>{% include 'footer.html' %}</code> in the templates where you need the footer HTML to appear. That way in future you will only need to edit footer.html when you wish to change something in the footer.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Suppose your <code>base.html</code> common for all other pages. You have some JS which are common for all pages.</p>
<p>So you can just tweak <code>base.html</code> something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="footer"&gt;
       Footer info
    &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;!---here include all JS--&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">No, JS is not common for all pages. In fact it is different for all pages</span>
<span class="comment-copy">then keep footer section in base.html</span>
