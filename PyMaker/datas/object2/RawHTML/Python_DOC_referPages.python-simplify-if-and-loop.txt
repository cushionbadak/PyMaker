<p>Our code reviewer is telling me that flag in the code below is bad and I need to refactor code in a "Python-like" style. I really can't understand how I can avoid this flag usage, here is a sample of code:</p>
<pre><code>flag = false
for (i in range(2,4)):
   zoom()
   if (check_condition()):
      flag = true
      break

if (flag):
   tap()
else:
   raise Exception("failed")
</code></pre>
<p>I can see the only way to make a tap inside if. In this case I will have to add a return statement inside a loop, which is not the best idea from the code style point of view, isn't it?</p>
<p>So maybe someone can suggest a better way to organize this code?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use an <code>else:</code> statement with the <code>for</code> statement. It's only executed if the loop finishes normally, instead of exiting with <code>break</code></p>
<pre><code>for i in range(2, 4):
    zoom()
    if check_condition():
        break
else:
    raise Exception("failed")

tap()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I don't think you need the falg here either, if you just call the <code>tab()</code> method instead of changing the flag value to true. It will work the same.</p>
<pre><code>for (i in range(2,4)):
   zoom()
   if (check_condition()):
      tab()
      break
else:
   raise Exception("failed")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Not related to the flag, but when you are reviewing: isn't <code>for i in (2, 3):</code> better?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, it is just misspelling, of course it had to be for i in (2,4)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, it was a case. Thanks!</span>
