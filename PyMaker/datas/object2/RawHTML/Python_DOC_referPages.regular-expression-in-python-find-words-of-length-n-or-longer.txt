<p>We just learned about using regular expression in my first python course (extremely new to programming), and one of the homework problems that I am struggling with requires us to use regular expression to find all the words of length n or longer, and then use that regular expression to find the longest word used from a text file.</p>
<p>I have no problem when I want to test out a specific length, but it returns an empty list when I use an arbitrary variable n:</p>
<pre><code>import re
with open('shakespeare.txt') as file:
    shakespeare = file.read()

n = 10 #if I take this out and put an actual number in the curly bracket below, it works just fine.

words = re.findall('^[A-Za-z\'\-]{n,}', shakespeare, re.M)
print(words)
len(words)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what I did wrong and how to resolve this. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>For more context...
To find the longest word, I used:</p>
<pre><code>#for word with special characters such as '-' and '''
longest_word = max(re.findall('\S+', shakespeare, re.M), key = len)

#for word without special characters:
longest_pure_word = max(re.findall('[A-Za-z]+ ', shakespeare, re.M), key = len)

output1(special char): tragical-comical-historical-pastoral
output2(pure word): honorificabilitudinitatibus
</code></pre>
<p>I didn't use n because I couldn't get the first part of the question to work.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>import re
with open('shakespeare.txt') as file:
    shakespeare = file.read()

n = 10

words = re.findall('^[A-Za-z\'\-]{'+str(n)+',}', shakespeare, re.M)
print(words)
len(words)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You need to mark strings as <code>r''</code> or use double backslashes for escapes instead. Also to put the value of <code>n</code> into the string you need to format it, using <code>'{{{n}}}'.format(n=n)</code>. The extra <code>'{{...}}'</code> are required to "survive" the formatting. Or you can use <code>'{%d}' % n</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why would you expect <code>n</code> to be replaced by a variable's contents, but no other character in the expression to be so replaced?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you clarifying!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! It worked beautifully!</span>
