<p>I am kinda confused why this is happening if running a jupyter notebook (using nbconvert --execute) with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>for key in dict:
   data = [go.Bar (x = dict[key].values(),
                   y = dict[key].keys(),
                   orientation = 'h')]

   layout = go.Layout(title = key, showlegend = False)
   fig = go.Figure(data = data, layout = layout)
   plotly.offline.plot(fig, filename= plots_path + key + '_plotly.html')
</code></pre>
<p>always leads to starting vs-code.
Does anyone experienced that issue before ?
How can I suppress it because I do the plotting in a loop and it is quite annoying to close more than 10 vs-code windows after each run.</p>
<p>Apparently it has to do something with the writing to html if I comment the last line out no vs-code windows are popping up.</p>
</div>

<p>Try this:
<code>plotly.offline.plot(fig, filename= plots_path + key + '_plotly.html', auto_open=False)</code></p>
<p>Default behavior is it will try to find a program to immediately open the html file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot for the fast reply! It worked :) I wonder why my system chose to open the HTML with vs-code and not with chrome...</span>
