<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def headName():
    print (Name[0].upper())

headName()

<p>That's my code; I want to know how to concatinate headName() and tailName(), so that they're on the same line. Thanks</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can't do that without rewriting the functions.  The newline is added by <code>print</code>.  Since you call <code>print</code> inside the functions, nothing you do outside the function can undo the newline that was already added inside.</p>
<p>A better idea is to have your functions <em>return</em> the values, and then do the printing outside:</p>
<pre><code>def headName():
    return Name[0].upper()
def tailName():
    return Name[1:].lower()

Name = input("Please enter a name ")
print(headName(), tailName(), sep="")
</code></pre>
<p>Incidentally, what you are doing can also be accomplished directly with <code>Name.title()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To print on the same line call them in one <code>print</code> statement, something like:</p>
<pre><code>print(headName(), ' ', tailName())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also use string formatting, which in case that you wanted to customize further the output would give you more control over the outcome:</p>
<pre><code>def headName():
    return Name[0].upper()
def tailName():
    return Name[1:].lower()

Name = input("Please enter a name ")
print('{}{}'.format(headName(), tailName()))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also try:</p>
<pre><code>def headName():
    print ((Name[0].upper()), end="")
</code></pre>
<p>This will cause your print function to end with nothing, instead of ending with a newline (default).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I assume you mean you want to get the <i>output</i> of <code>headName</code> and <code>tailName</code> on the same line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean: do you want to define two functions on the same line? Do you want each function definition to only take up one line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes BrenBarn. It keeps putting it on two lines</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So, it's not to do with functions, it's to do with output.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That worked perfectly, thanks a lot. I have a question about your solution in order to better understand it; what does the, 'sep=" ")' mean? I haven't learnt about this yet, so am unsure WHY it works</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TheWhiteWolf: By default, <code>print</code> inserts a space between each pair of things you print on the same line.  Setting <code>sep</code> to the empty string prevents it from doing that, so that you get, e.g., <code>"Somedude"</code> instead of <code>"S omedude"</code>.  See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a> for more info.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah I see; thanks again :)</span>
