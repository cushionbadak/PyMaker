<p>So I want to know if there is a command that stops a running script completely.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To exit the script in your code you would have to do this:</p>
<p>The <code>sys.exit()</code> function will exit the program, and will give an error message. This is the function performing as wanted.</p>
<pre><code>import sys
#do some stuff
elif schoice2 == 2:
    print "You run away from the bear about as fast as Usian Bolt, even though you have no clue who that is since it's the year 1112, but you decide not to dwell on who or what a 'Usian Bolt' is. The bear gives chase, then ultimitely crashes down on you, giving you a fast death."
    print "YOU ARE DEAD, TRY AGAIN!"
    sys.exit()
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>The <code>quit()</code> function will not give the error message, and will just end the program.</p>
<p>The new code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
#do some stuff
elif schoice2 == 2:
    print "You run away from the bear about as fast as Usian Bolt, even though you have no clue who that is since it's the year 1112, but you decide not to dwell on who or what a 'Usian Bolt' is. The bear gives chase, then ultimitely crashes down on you, giving you a fast death."
    print "YOU ARE DEAD, TRY AGAIN!"
    quit()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>raise</code></a> as wwii said to raise an error? or use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/sys.html#sys.exit" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sys.exit()</code></a> as g.d.d.c said to exit the program?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just to exit the program if certain parameters are met, such as certain choices a user makes in a game.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you just want to exit the program, take a look about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/sys.html#sys.exit" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sys.exit()</code></a>.</span>
