<p>I'm trying to learn Python 3. This is an example I am trying to learn from. So here I define a function to read text. Open a file, read the contents, print it, then close.</p>
<p>So this code runs well. The thing I don't understand, however, is why we write:</p>
<p>print(contents_of_file), but not read(quotes). How come it's quotes.read()? As far I can understand both print() and read() are functions and I expected both to be used the same way. What am I missing here - please help?</p>
<p>Is there a rule when to put stuff inside brackets and when not to?</p>
<pre><code>def read_text():
    quotes = open("/Users/me/text.txt", encoding = "utf-8")
    contents_of_file = quotes.read()
    print(contents_of_file)
    quotes.close()
read_text()
</code></pre>

<p><code>print()</code> is a function. <code>read()</code> is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>method</strong> of the object</a> bound to <code>quotes</code>. As such, <code>read</code> must be referred to by accessing <code>quotes</code>. Only then can we add parens to invoke it.</p>

<p>You've stumbled across the often argued definitions of functions and methods.</p>
<p><code>read()</code> is a method that belongs to <code>quotes</code> (which is an instance of a class, I don't actually know the name of which).  Technically, <em>Methods</em> belong to <em>Objects</em>, <em>Functions</em> are normally defined in a style that isn't strictly Object Orientated, or in global scope (like all C functions).</p>
<p>It might be worth reading up on the OOP aspects of Python, this will likely help you understand it more.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>quotes</code> is a file object. I understand you don't yet know what is an object. But try printing <code>quotes</code>.</p>
<pre><code>print type(quotes)
</code></pre>
<p>This object has a function <code>read()</code> whose purpose is to read contents from the file. </p>
<p>To call a function of an object, you have to write:</p>
<pre><code>object.funcName()
</code></pre>
<p>As this is exactly what we want, we are just calling that function. So  we are writing:</p>
<pre><code>quotes.read()
</code></pre>
<p><code>print</code> doesn't belongs to any of these type of objects. So, we can call it without any object reference.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can't say <code>read(quotes)</code> but you can say <code>io.TextIOWrapper.read(quotes)</code>, however you'll now also have to <code>import io</code>. But why would you want to?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That was very helpful. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's some descendant of <code>io.TextIOBase</code>, not that it really matters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sure I'll remember that in some strange, irrelevant moment in the future.</span>
