<p>I tried to install Jupyter on my Mac (10.9). </p>
<p>Since I'm using a computer at the university and don't have permission to write in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, I downloaded Ipython from <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/releases" rel="nofollow">GitHub</a> and typed <code>python3.4 setup.py install --user</code> on Terminal.</p>
<p>Though I didn't get any error while installing, Jupyter does not launch when I type <code>ipython notebook</code> (<code>ipython3 notebook</code> or <code>jupyter</code> were the same) and I got <code>command not found</code> error.</p>
<p>(I also tried to install via pip. However, pip does not work on my computer and I couldn't activate it using <code>ensurepip</code>.)</p>

<p>Why does pip not work? (insufficient privileges to write into system packages)?  </p>
<p>Have you tried a virtual environments <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow">Creation of virtual environments</a>? They are very useful for managing your environment so that you have local packages and a local bin folder for things like <code>ipython</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3 -m venv my_venv
$ source my_venv/bin/activate
$ pip install ipython[all]
</code></pre>
<p>This will install into your <code>my_venv</code> environment.</p>
