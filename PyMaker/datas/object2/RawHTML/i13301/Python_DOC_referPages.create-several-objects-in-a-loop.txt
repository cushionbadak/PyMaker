<p>We have a problem in our program creating several objects in a loop. We're reading a list of all the elements in the periodic table and their respective atom weights from a text file. We want to create an individual object for each atom with the atom weight and the atom name as attributes. How would we easiest go about doing this? </p>
<p>So far, what we've come up with is this: We've created one list with all the atom names, and one with their weights. And then we tried making a loop to create multiple objects without having to create them one by one individually so we tried this:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(name_list)):
    name_list[i] = Atom(atom_name=name_list[i], atom_weight=weight_list[i])
</code></pre>
<p>(Our class is named <code>Atom</code> and has the attributes <code>atom_name</code> and <code>atom_weight</code>)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think what you want is:</p>
<pre><code>name_list = [Atom(*data) for data in zip(name_list, weight_list)]
</code></pre>
<p>If this syntax is unfamiliar, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/6475314/3001761">Python for-in loop preceded by a variable</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/36901/3001761">What does ** (double star) and * (star) do for parameters?</a> If your class only accepts keyword arguments, you can switch to:</p>
<pre><code>name_list = [Atom(atom_name=name, atom_weight=weight) 
             for name, weight in zip(name_list, weight_list)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much! We dont recognize the "data in zip" syntax but we'll try looking it up :-)</span>

<span class="comment-copy">However, we didn't get this to work.. We want to name the objects by their atom name, so that we can easily reach them. What we want is something like: Ag = Atom(atom_name="Ag", atom_weight="23") but to do that for all the elements in a loop so we dont have to write them out individually.. Is there any way around that? :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zacdawg that's totally different to what you asked for. You should put them in a dictionary, not a list, mapping name to <code>Atom</code> instance; look up <i>"dictionary comprehension"</i> and you can make minor tweaks to what I've given you. Then you can easily access e.g. <code>atoms['Ag']</code> to get the object.</span>
