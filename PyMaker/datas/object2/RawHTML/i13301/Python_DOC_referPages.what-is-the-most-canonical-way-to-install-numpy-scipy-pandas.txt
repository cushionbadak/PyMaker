<p>I need to install Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, and sklearn.
I downloaded Numpy and Scipy individually from their websites, but Scipy warns not to install manually, and when I try to install Numpy I get an error 'could not locate executable g77'. Scipy recommends using Anaconda. I have downloaded Anaconda, but cannot see how to download Numpy and Scipy using it. Also, apparently, I can use Macports, for which I need Xcode, and I have tried downloading Xcode twice and it won't open - the reviews say the new version is buggy.
Thus, what is the most conventional and effective way to install these tools? Did Anaconda automatically install Numpy and Scipy?</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/" rel="nofollow">pip</a> for installing Python packages.</p>

<p>pip is the preferred installer program</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Try importing numpy (or those other libraries) and see if it works.  I believe Anaconda does by default install those libs.  If not, look at anaconda documentation to see how to install libraries.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Anaconda will give you everything you mentioned with much more. It also makes it easy to keep it all up to date. See <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads" rel="nofollow noreferrer">continuum.io/downloads</a></span>
