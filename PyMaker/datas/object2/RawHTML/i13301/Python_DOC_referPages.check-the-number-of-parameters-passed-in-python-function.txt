<p>I'm new in Python and wants to know if there is a simple way to get amount of passed parameters in Python function.</p>
<pre><code>a(1, 2, 3) ==&gt;3
a(1, 2) ==&gt;2
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do this by using locals()</p>
<p>It is important to note, that this should be done as ultimately, your first step in your method. If you introduce a new variable in your method, you will change your results. So make sure you follow it this way:</p>
<pre><code>def a(a, b, c):
    # make this your first statement
    print(len(locals()))
</code></pre>
<p>If you did this:</p>
<pre><code>def a(a, b, c):
    z = 5
    print(len(locals()))
</code></pre>
<p>You would end up getting 4, which would not be right for your expected results.</p>
<p>Documentation on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#locals" rel="noreferrer">locals()</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def a(*args, **kwargs):
  print(len(args) + len(kwargs))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you could also change the input for your function to a list, so to have a function:</p>
<pre><code>a(your_list)
</code></pre>
<p>then to know how many arguments have been passed to the function,
you could simply do:</p>
<pre><code>print len(your_list)
</code></pre>
<p>However, this means that you change the input type for your function,
from many input variables to only one, the list(which can have a variable number of elements).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Probably worth mentioning that you have to do this before you've done any assignments within the function for it to work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Marius, good call. I changed it, let me know what you think.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, actually I will use in the beginning of the function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm giving +1 to this anwer, because argument counting inside a function does make sense only when there are variable amount of them.</span>
