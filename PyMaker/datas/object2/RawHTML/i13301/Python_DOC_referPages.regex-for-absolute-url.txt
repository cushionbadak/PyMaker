<p>I am searching quite a while for a regex compatible with Python's <code>re</code> module for finding all URLs in HTML document and I cannot find it except one that was only to able to check whether an url is valid or invalid (with <code>match</code> method). I want to do simple </p>
<pre><code>import requests
html_response = requests.get('http://example.com').text
urls = url_pattern.findall(html_response)
</code></pre>
<p>I suppose needed regex (if exists) would be complex enough to take into consideration a bunch of special cases of urls so it cannot be some oneline code.</p>

<p>Use <strong>BeautifulSoup</strong> instead.It's simple to use and allows you to parse pages with HTML. </p>
