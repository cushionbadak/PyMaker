<p>I am very new to Python, going through a guide, and was wondering when you state the following (code below) what are the differences? </p>
<p>There seems to be a pattern here that maybe I'm not catching on and the more I push through the guide the more this question pops up in my head :)</p>
<pre><code>print(' ')
print(" ")
print(   )

find(' ')
find(" ")
find(   )

urlopen(' ')
urlopen(" ")
urlopen(   )
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str" rel="nofollow">Strings</a>, type <code>str</code>, in <code>Python 2</code> or <code>3</code> can be declared by using single quotes <code>' '</code> or double quotes <code>" "</code> (and triple quotes <code>""" """</code> which, generally, have a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#documentation-strings" rel="nofollow">special purpose</a>). Python treats them similarly.</p>
<p>For the first two cases of your <code>print()</code> function, you are just passing the space character <code>' '</code> and <code>" "</code> and <code>print()</code> is just consequently just printing it. A similar logic applies to the other functions.</p>
<p>A function called with empty parenthesis <code>( )</code> just means that no arguments have been passed to it. What behavior this has (and <strong><em>if it is allowed</em></strong>) is up to the definition of the function called. </p>
<hr/>
<p>For instance, the documentation for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print()</code></a> function states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If no objects are given, print() will just write end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With <code>end</code> here being specified as the new line sequence <code>\n</code>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The only special cases where you need to use <code>" "</code> instead of <code>' '</code> is if your string contains <code>' '</code>. Vice-versa, you will need to use <code>' '</code> if your string contains <code>" "</code>.</p>
<p>So, for example:</p>
<pre><code>print("This is a 'special' case") 
# prints: This is a 'special' case.

print("This is a "special" case") 
# error: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>And vice versa:</p>
<pre><code>print('This is a "special" case') 
# prints: This is a "special" case.

print('This is a 'special' case') 
# error: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>Let's note that with triple quotes <code>""" """</code> you can have a string with both <code>' '</code> <strong><em>and</em></strong> <code>" "</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print(""" this is a "special" 'special' case""") 
# prints: this is a "special" 'special' case
</code></pre>
<p><strong><em>Try these out</em></strong> to get a feel of them.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">in the first two cases you pass a string with a space to the functions/callables. In the third you pass nothing to the functions (i.e. no argument is passed explicitly)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, that is very interesting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank You!   So does that mean that ' and " are effectively the same? Where are they different?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have edited my answer to include the only possible case where you might want to differentiate between them :)</span>
