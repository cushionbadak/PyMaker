<p>I save a book as a text file on my python and i am trying to read the file line by line. I have tried using this </p>
<pre><code>def print_file1(filename):
    f = open(filename, 't')
    for line in f:
        print(line, end = '')
    f.close() #optional
</code></pre>
<p>But, everytime i try running this, it doesn't work. 
This is what i get as my output</p>
<pre>
runfile('/Users/kareemahokunlola/example.py', wdir='/Users/kareemahokunlola')
</pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>By itself <code>'t'</code> is not a valid mode for opening a file.</p>
<p>You could specify mode as <code>rt</code>. If you omit the mode it will default to <code>'r'</code> (read in text mode) which is probably sufficient for your purposes. (If your file contains binary data, you can add the <code>'b'</code> to the mode.)</p>
<p>I would also consider writing it like this with a <code>with</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>def print_file1(filename):
    with open(filename) as f:
        for line in f:
            print(line, end = '')
</code></pre>
<p>This has the advantage that you don't need to worry about closing the file - it will happen automatically upon exit from the <code>with</code> statement, for whatever reason.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>So you are executing this code from within the Spyder IDE? When you successfully run a script Spyder will display: </p>
<pre>
runfile('/Users/kareemahokunlola/example.py', wdir='/Users/kareemahokunlola')
</pre>
<p>in the console. This is what you are seeing, so your script is running without error.</p>
<p>There are a couple of possibile explanations:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are not calling the function <code>print_file1()</code> from within your
script. The script runs without error, but the file is not displayed
because <code>print_file1()</code> is not called. This is the most likely
explanation because your original code that attempts to open the
file with mode <code>'t'</code> will raise an exception, and that exception
will be logged to the console. But the error is not displayed, hence it is probable that the function is not actually called.</li>
<li>You are calling <code>print_file1()</code> but the file is empty. In this case
the "runfile()" message will be displayed because the script ran
successfully, but nothing else is seen because the file is empty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try adding a call to <code>print_file1()</code> after you define the function:</p>
<pre><code>def print_file1(filename):
    with open(filename) as f:
        for line in f:
            print(line, end = '')

# N.B. call the function...
print_file1('/etc/hosts')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would put my money on the following statement:</p>
<pre><code>print(line, end = '')
            ^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>You're telling Python to print the line without a newline, effectively concatenating all individual lines into a single line on the screen.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>f.close() #optional</code> - not optional! Not closing your files is like not flushing your poop; it might seem like there aren't any consequences, but the mess you're leaving can cause things to break in nasty ways. Running out of file descriptors, data not being flushed, etc. You don't want to have to deal with that. Always use a <code>with</code> block.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>Line by Line</i>? Do you need <code>with open(filename) as f: text = f.readlines()</code>? If you run this then <code>text</code> will be a list and save all data of the file like <code>['first line\n', 'second line\n']</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While it is good to use 'close', it is not required for simple file reading like this.  The file will be closed when the script ends.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hpaulj: And if you're not planning to stick around for long, you can get away with not flushing your poop. Please, just do it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But Python is one of those modern systems that senses your presence, and flushes when you are gone.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1834766/901925">stackoverflow.com/a/1834766/901925</a>.  MInd you, I don't intend to discourage anyone from using <code>close</code>, or better yet <code>with open</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just tried using this instead. But when i ran it, i still got the same output. I'm not sure if it is my spyder that has a problem.  Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The output is not helpful. Is there a traceback or more complete error message? How do you know that this block of code is causing the problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, it doesn't show any other error message. It shows the same message every time a run a file and i am not sure why. It just prints out                            In 1: runfile('/Users/kareemahokunl/example.py', wdir='/Users/kareemahokunl')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kayoll Do any matters here? What's the output that you wish?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have shown us a function.  how do you call the function?  How do you call the script?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you,( the end = '') was  the main problem</span>
