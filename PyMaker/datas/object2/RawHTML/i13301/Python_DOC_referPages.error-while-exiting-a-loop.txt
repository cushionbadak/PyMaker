<p>I'm creating a program in which the user enters a list of names and the computer then prints it out any names which have been duplicated. The code I have so far is:</p>
<pre><code>names = []
final = []

enter = raw_input('Enter the name')
while enter != 'exit':
    names.append(enter)
    enter = raw_input('Enter the name')

for i in names:
    for a in (names):
        a = i + 1
        if a == i:
            final.append(i)

print final
</code></pre>
<p>I get an error when it reaches</p>
<pre><code>a = i + 1
</code></pre>
<p>How can I fix this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can find duplicates by doing this (in place of your <code>for</code> loops)</p>
<pre><code>print set(x for x in names if names.count(x) &gt; 1)
</code></pre>
<p>This is going to return a <code>set</code> of values that appears in the <code>names</code> variable more than one time. </p>
<hr/>
<pre><code>names = []
final = []

enter = raw_input('Enter the name')
while enter != 'exit':
    names.append(enter)
    enter = raw_input('Enter the name')

print(set(x for x in names if names.count(x) &gt; 1))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Enter the nameAndy
Enter the nameAndy
Enter the nameAndy
Enter the nameBob
Enter the nameGeorge
Enter the nameAndy
Enter the nameBob
Enter the nameexit
set(['Bob', 'Andy'])
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p><code>Bob</code> and <code>Andy</code> were entered more than once. George was not, thus doesn't appear in the set.</p>

<p>You can not assign to a string object, if you want to get the strings that have duplicates in your list you better to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> which returns a Counter object, then you can extract the names that those count is more than one.</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

for name,cnt in Counter(names):
    if cnt&gt;1:
       print name
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you expect that for loop to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you're assigning <code>a = i + 1</code> the following <code>if</code> condition, <code>if a == i:</code>,  will never be true...</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>i</code> is a character string, you can't add <code>1</code> to it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">BTW: The list comprehension is unnecessary overhead in the <code>set()</code> construction, the generator is sufficient: <code>set(x for x in names if names.count(x) &gt; 1)</code></span>
