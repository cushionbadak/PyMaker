<p>I want to use <code>imaplib</code> in Python on Fedora.  I tried <code>yum install imap</code> but got <code>Loaded plugins: langpacks, refresh-packagekit No package imap available. Error: Nothing to do</code>.  How do I install imaplib?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html" rel="nofollow"><code>imaplib</code></a> is a built in package that comes with Python.  You don't need to install anything separately.  Even if you did, you'd more likely have to install a Python package with <code>pip</code> than a system package with <code>yum</code>.  Simply import the package and start coding.</p>
<pre><code>import imaplib
</code></pre>
