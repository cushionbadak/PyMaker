<p>I'm fairly new to python (still in the first few chapters of an introductory book) and i was wondering, once i have defined a function and saved it in script mode, and i want to use it in another script do i have to define it the new program? </p>
<p>To clarify suppose a create a function <code>multiplybyfive(x)</code> which takes an input and x and returns 5x. Now suppose i create a program which uses <code>multiplybyfive(x)</code> in it, do i have to define it again in this new program or can i simply call it somehow?</p>

<p>You can import the python file which contains function multiplybyfive(x) into your new file. </p>
<p>For example, if you write multiplybyfive(x) in file mathfunction.py file.
You can use it in a new program by</p>
<pre><code>from mathfunction import multiplybyfive

x = 1
y = multiplybyfive(x)
print y
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Why would you want to define it again? Most languages don't work like this. Consider the following layout:</p>
<pre><code>src:
|-- some_module_with_function_def.py
|-- some_other_module_to_call_function.py
</code></pre>
<p>You can have the function definition in <code>some_module_with_function_def.py</code> and you can then use it in <code>some_other_module_to_call_function.py</code> just by doing this:</p>
<pre><code>from some_module_with_function_def import multiplybyfive

x = multiplybyfive(10)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, i tried this in the idle mode import multiplybyfive(x) and it came up with an error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you need a from. <code>from path/to/file import multiplybyfive</code> then later you can use it like this. <code>multiplybyfive(x)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PavanSangha I would advise you to continue <b>reading the book</b>, rather than asking here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok thanks, I've tried using that in IDLE mode but it doesn't work, does that just work for script mode?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PavanSangha you cant just copy paste an import. it has to be a folder path from your computer. look at where the folder is and figure out what your path is</span>
