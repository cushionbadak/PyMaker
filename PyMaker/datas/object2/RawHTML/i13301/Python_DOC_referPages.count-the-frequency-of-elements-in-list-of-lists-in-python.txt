<p>Say, I have the following sorted list of lists :</p>
<p>List 1  : (12,24,36)</p>
<p>List 2  : (3,5,12,24)</p>
<p>List 3  : (36,41,69)</p>
<p>I want to find out the frequency of each element in the entire list of lists. I came up with an ugly module for the same in python but I was wondering if there is some library function..</p>
<p>Edit : Please find the code below </p>
<pre><code>def find_frequency(transactions,list):
    freq = 0
    for items_transaction in transactions:
        flag = 0
        for candidate in list:
            if candidate not in items_transaction:
                flag = 1
                break
        if flag == 0:
            freq += 1
    return freq
</code></pre>

<p>Counter does what I believe you are looking for:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from itertools import chain
&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Counter
&gt;&gt;&gt; list1, list2, list3 = [12,24,36], [3,5,12,24], [36,41,69]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Counter(chain(list1, list2, list3))
Counter({3: 1, 5: 1, 12: 2, 24: 2, 36: 2, 41: 1, 69: 1})
</code></pre>

<p>You need to flatten a list - that is, transform it to a single long sequence of all values. It can be done using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain" rel="nofollow">itertools.chain</a></p>
<pre><code>import collections, itertools
l = [[12,24,36], [3,5,12,24], [36,41,69]]
freq = collections.defaultdict(int)  # 0 by default
for x in itertools.chain.from_iterable(l):
    freq[x] += 1
print(freq)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could flatten the list using what some other posters have said, and then do something like this.</p>
<pre><code>def numList(list):
        dic = {}
        for num in list:
            if num in dic.keys():
                dic[num] += 1
            else:       
                key = num
                value = 1
                dic[key] = value
        return dic
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a dictionary of all the numbers in a list and their frequencies.  The dictionary key is the number, and its value is the frequency.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For those who searched by the title referring to list of lists, it seems like a simple solution is:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import chain
from collections import Counter
list_of_lists = [[12,24,36], [3,5,12,24], [36,41,69]]
Counter(chain.from_iterable(list_of_lists)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the code that you came up with? Please show your efforts first.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't use <code>list</code> as a variable name - it's a type name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you are going to use <code>collections</code>, you may as well use <code>Counter</code> :)</span>
