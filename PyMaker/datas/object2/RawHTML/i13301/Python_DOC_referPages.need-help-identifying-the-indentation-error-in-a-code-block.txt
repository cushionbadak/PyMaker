<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I tried defining a function below (part of a longer code block), but came across an 'indentation error' identified at the 4th line.
Could somebody please tell me what the error is?</p>
<pre><code>guess = int(raw_input('Your first guess?  '))
def next_guess(n):
    n -= 1
    print "You now have %s attempts left" %n
    guess = int(raw_input('Your next guess?  '))
</code></pre>

<p>Your indentation is a mix of tabs and spaces. The tab character might look like it's four spaces wide in your text editor/IDE, but Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#indentation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">can interpret it</a> as anywhere between one and eight spaces. This can cause Python to become very confused. Replace the tab on your <code>n -= 1</code> line with spaces.</p>
