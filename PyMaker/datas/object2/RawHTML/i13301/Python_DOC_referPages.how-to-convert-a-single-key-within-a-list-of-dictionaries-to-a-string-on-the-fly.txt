<p>I'm writing a REST API to manage some storage appliances.</p>
<p>I have the following snippet that returns a list of dictionaries. The dictionaries in the list are completely identical in structure and number/types of keys. I want to concatenate a single key from each dictionary into a string:</p>
<pre><code>result.getJSONData()['chassis']  # returns a list of dictionaries
</code></pre>
<p>The actual value I want to concatenate is this (here I'm just looping thru the list and printing the key I want to concatenate):</p>
<pre><code>for chassis in result.getJSONData()['chassis']:
    print chassis['name']
</code></pre>
<p>Here is where I want to concatenate and use this string (one of my many attempts at doing this):</p>
<pre><code>log.info("  %s: discovered the following chassis: %s" % (self.name, result.getJSONData()['chassis']['name'].join(", ")))
</code></pre>
<p>This is a threaded application so I'm trying to make log entries as autonomous as possible, hence why I'm trying to display this all in one log entry.</p>

<p>You're looking for a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a> (or generator expression in this case):</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Ahh that's it. Couldn't recall the exact syntax and had trouble searching for it. Thx, I'll give this a shot.</span>
