<p>I have to create a calculator for a small piece of schoolwork and I ask for inputs for the numbers and the symbol that will be used:</p>
<pre><code>number1=int(input("\nWhat is your first number?"))

number2=int(input("\nWhat is your second number?"))

symbol=input("\nWhat is the symbol you will use?")
</code></pre>
<p>I want to know if there is any way I can make the <code>int(input())</code> be asked again if they enter anything apart from an integer. </p>
<p>I'm not really good with Python atm so apologies if I missed something obvious.
Also sorry if this thread is a duplicate.</p>

<p>The canonical method in python would be something like:</p>
<pre><code>def get_integer_or_retry(mesg)
   while True:
      val = input(mesg) # or raw_input for python 2
      try:
          val = int(val)
          return val
      except ValueError: #trying to cast string as int failed
          pass # or you could let the user know their input was invalid
</code></pre>
<p>Note that if the user inputs 1.0 (or some other decimal that is also an integer), this will still throw ValueError (thanks  Robáµ© ); if you need to handle floats that happen to be integers, you could do <code>val = int(float(val))</code>, but that will also accept (and silently round down) floating numbers ... </p>

<p>To know a variables type do <code>type(var)</code>. </p>
<p>So, basically what you need to do:</p>
<pre><code> if type(variable)==int:
     do_something
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try isinstance method (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance</a>)</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(5, int)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance("a", int)
False
</code></pre>
<p>in your case write a conditional, like,</p>
<pre><code>if isinstance(number1, int):
    #do something
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>The isinstance() built-in function is recommended for testing the type
  of an object, because it takes subclasses into account.</p>

<p>I'm going to assume Python 2.7 for this answer.</p>
<p>I suggest first getting the input as a string, using <code>raw_input</code>, and
then trying to convert that to an integer.  Python will raise an
exception if the conversion fails, which you can catch and prompt the
user to try again.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    try:
        s1 = raw_input('Enter integer: ')
        n1 = int(s1)
        # if we get here, conversion succeeded
        break
    except ValueError:
        print('"%s" is not an integer' % s1)

print('integer doubled is %d' % (2*n1))
</code></pre>
<p>and here's a sample execution, with inputs:</p>
<pre><code>$ python 33107568.py
Enter integer: foo
"foo" is not an integer
Enter integer: 1.1
"1.1" is not an integer
Enter integer: 0x23123
"0x23123" is not an integer
Enter integer: 123
integer doubled is 246
</code></pre>
<p>On Python 3, you'd need to use <code>input</code> instead of <code>raw_input</code>; in
Python 2, <code>input</code> evaluates the user input as a Python expression,
which is rarely what is desired.</p>
