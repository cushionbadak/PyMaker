<p>I want to make a condition for when 2 of these variables are identical without doing...</p>
<pre><code>if CPcard1 == CPcard2 or CPcard1 == card1 or CPcard1  == card2 (etc)
</code></pre>
<p>This is part of a poker simulation I'm making.(note: CPcard1 and CPcard2 belong to the first player and cards 1,2 and 3 belong tothe table. all cards where found with the same method as CPcard1 above) I just want to make the program identify a pair. I'm relatively new to coding and I'm a noob so any help would be much appreciated :) </p>

<p>First, some notes about your setup: The way you select random cards is (a) cumbersome, and (b) incorrect. By randomly selecting a suit, and then a card from that suit, each suit has the same chance of being selected (1/4), even if there is just one (or none!) card left in that suit.</p>
<p>Instead, I suggest just doing it the same way you would do in real life: Put all the cards in one deck, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.shuffle" rel="nofollow">shuffle</a> the deck, and pop cards from that shuffled deck.</p>
<pre><code>all_cards = spades + hearts + clubs + diamonds
random.shuffle(all_cards)
hand = [all_cards.pop() for _ in range(5)]
</code></pre>
<p>Also, instead of manually enumerating all the cards, you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.product</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>values = list('23456789') + ['10'] + list('JQKA')
suits = list('SHCD')
all_cards = [''.join(pair) for pair in itertools.product(suits, values)]
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>About finding pairs (or triplets, or quadruplets): The easiest way to do this would be to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow"><code>collections.Counter</code></a>. But also note that you do not really need the cards to be the same, as you do with <code>==</code>! Instead, it is enough if the value is the same, the suit can be different.</p>
<pre><code>import collections
counts = collections.Counter([card[:-1] for card in hand])
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>card[:-1]</code> will get the value from the card string, e.g. <code>'10'</code> from <code>'10S'</code>. You can then use <code>counts.most_common</code> to get the most common pairs (or triplets, etc.), if any.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hand
['3C', '6S', 'KC', 'JH', 'KH']
&gt;&gt;&gt; counts
Counter({'K': 2, '3': 1, 'J': 1, '6': 1})
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Put them in a <code>set</code> and check the size? BTW, do you know about <code>random.randint</code> and <code>random.choice</code>? Also, you do not pick cards randomly. Even after you picked 9 cards from hearts, the chance to get another heart will be 1/4.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>'CPcard2' is not defined</code> CPcard2 is missing. Could you update your code according to its purpose.</span>
