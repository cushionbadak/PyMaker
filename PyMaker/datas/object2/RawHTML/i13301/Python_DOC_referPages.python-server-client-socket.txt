<p>I've tried to connect two computers with a socket in Python and I don't know why it doesn't work. The files are from internet and it compiles for me but without any results.</p>
<p>The server.py:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python           

import socket               

s = socket.socket()       
host = '' 
port = 12345                
s.bind((host, port))        

s.listen(5)                 
while True:
    c, addr = s.accept()     
    print 'Got connection from', addr
    c.send('Thank you for connecting')
    c.close() 
</code></pre>
<p>and the client.py:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python           

import socket               

s = socket.socket()         
host = # here I put the ip of the server's laptop
port = 12345                

s.connect((host, port))
print s.recv(1024)
s.close()
</code></pre>
<p>What's wrong? </p>

<p>You have to run the server first. Then run the client <strong>at the same time</strong>  with the IP of the server (I used localhost because it was running on one computer, maybe you should try if that works). The code worked fine for me, every time I ran the client, the server printed a message. If it doesn't work for you, maybe your firewall is not letting you open ports.</p>
<p>Just for the future, please always post any error messages you see.</p>
<p>BTW, isn't this the Python Documentation example for sockets?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This won't work, because there's a syntax error in the code. Anyhow, where is that code from? I'm asking because it is for old Python 2, and probably outdated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_networking.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorialspoint.com/python/python_networking.htm</a> it's from here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What <i>results</i> are you expecting? BTW, you can try replacing <code>send</code> with <code>sendall</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">After fixing indentations and using localhost, this code worked for me. Are you saying nothing printed? You should have gotten an error exception at the least.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know that the issues are miniscule, @tdelaney, but it still suggests that the tutorial is outdated. If you look around a bit, you will find lots of ads, a 10$ download for the PDF and all that for a tutorial obviously based on Python 2.4. This is a tutorial to avoid! Instead, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html</a> and a contemporary Python version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think this better written as a comment than an answer. OP hasn't told us what went on. And it is very close to the simple examples in the doc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I fixed all the indentation problems. I used the IP of the server (I am running on two computers) and is still not receveing any message.. But still, I'm not sure what did you mean by "run the client at the same time with the IP of the server", how's that, if I run the server first?</span>
