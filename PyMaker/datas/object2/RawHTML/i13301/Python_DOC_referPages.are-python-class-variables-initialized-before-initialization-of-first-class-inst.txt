<p>I don't yet know how to find information in the Python docs when I need it. I would appreciate it if someone could point me to the section that addresses class variable initialization. <strong>I would like to know when class variables are initialized.</strong> </p>
<p>This is of interest to me because I have written a class that holds a single database connection in a class variable, so I would like to ensure that this connection is not opened until the first class instance is created. </p>
<p>I realize I could do this by initially setting the connection to None and then initializing it when the first instance is initialized, in its <strong>init</strong> method, but this seems more complicated than it should be. Am I safe with the following:</p>
<pre><code>class DatabaseConnection:   
    connection = DB_API.makeConnection()
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#class-definitions">documentation</a> for class definitions says, as one of the steps in executing the class definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The classâ€™s suite is then executed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(A "suite" is a code block, i.e., the body of the class definition.)</p>
<p>So the class body is executed right away when the class is defined.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The class body gets executed when the class is <i>defined</i> so the connection will be created as soon as you import the module containing that class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tzaman thanks. mind telling me how you know this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorial</a> is useful. You could also just try putting a <code>print</code> there and see what happens.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Who downvoted this? It's the right answer...</span>
