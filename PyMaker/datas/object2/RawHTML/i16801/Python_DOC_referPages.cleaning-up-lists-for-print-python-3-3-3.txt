<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This should be a simple thing to do, but I just can't find the answer to it. How can I get this:</p>
<pre><code>myList=["hello","nice","people"]
print(myList)
</code></pre>
<p>...to write:</p>
<pre><code>hello
nice
people
</code></pre>
<p>I can remove the brackets OR get the posts on separate lines, but not both. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print</code></a> can handle this by itself if you use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/2322355/2555451">argument unpacking</a> (splatting) and set the function's <code>sep</code> parameter to a newline:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; myList = ["hello", "nice", "people"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(*myList, sep="\n")
hello
nice
people
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To explain further about argument unpacking, writing this:</p>
<pre><code>print(*["hello", "nice", "people"], sep="\n")
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to writing this:</p>
<pre><code>print("hello", "nice", "people", sep="\n")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">No, just no. Please read some python tutorial.. Learn how to use loops. There are zillions of those, just a few click to google.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Dude, good luck explaining "sequence", "sequence unpacking", and "parameter"..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@aIKid - Actually, I had a typo.  It is called "argument unpacking".  Anyways, I added links if the OP wants more information.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hum, hum :D Still, IMHO this question should be closed.</span>
