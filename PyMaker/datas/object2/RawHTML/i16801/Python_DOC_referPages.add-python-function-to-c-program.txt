<p>If I have a program in <code>c++</code>, can I add my own function <code>my_fun()</code> written in <code>Python</code> to this program? Is any simple tutorial how can I do that? I found some suggestions about boost and built-in functions, but I can't find how add my own function</p>

<p>There is information in the Python documentation about embedded Python in C++ programs.
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/extending/embedding.html#very-high-level-embedding" rel="nofollow">Here is the Python 2 version of the documentation</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html#very-high-level-embedding" rel="nofollow">here is the Python 3 version</a></p>
<p>Without knowing how simple or complex my_fun is - the "very high level embedding" might be sufficient for your needs.</p>
