<p>I use flask and flask's internal web server on a unix based os. I run it like;</p>
<pre><code>APP.run(host='', port=8000, threaded=True, debug=False)
</code></pre>
<p>I restart some serivces in my code like</p>
<pre><code>  for service in ACTIVE_SERVICES:
        command = "/etc/init.d/%s restart" % service
        # stdout and stderr are string which output of command
        stdout, stderr = Popen(command, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE,shell=True).communicate()
</code></pre>
<p>When I stop flask app, other services ,which I restart, start to listen 8000 port. It is caused by file descriptors opening by flask inherited by subprocess. For prevent this problem I try to reach all file descriptors of socket. How can do that?</p>

<p>For solving this problem, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/gc.html" rel="nofollow">gc</a> can be used for getting all creating object. After create and bind socket, you can run this code and get all socketobjects;</p>
<pre><code>for sock in filter(lambda x: type(x) == socket._socketobject, gc.get_objects()):
    fd = sock.fileno()
    old_flags = fcntl.fcntl(fd, fcntl.F_GETFD)
    fcntl.fcntl(fd, fcntl.F_SETFD, old_flags | fcntl.FD_CLOEXEC)
</code></pre>
<p>This code prevent inheritance of sockets' file descriptor.  </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In that case Popen should be called with close_fds = True.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">fcntl is UNIX specific, it is not available on Windows. Is there any workaround for Windows?</span>
