<p>Is there a way to use the <code>from X import Y as Z</code> idiom on a multiline import?</p>
<p>Specifically, I want to write something like <code>from some.very.long.package.name import LongName as OtherLongName</code>. The whole thing does not fit in one line.</p>
<p>So I tried to write it using parentheses to cross lines, but I found some strange behavior with the <code>as</code> keyword. Specifically:</p>
<pre><code>#this is just fine
from os import (
  path)

#this is a syntax error
from os import (
  path) as os_path
</code></pre>
<p>The only way I have figured out to do what I want is therefore:</p>
<pre><code>from some.very.long.package.name import (
  LongName)
OtherLongName = LongName
</code></pre>
<p>Is there any way to do it in one statement?</p>
</div>

<p>Add a slash where you want to stop:</p>
<pre><code>from some.very.long.package.name import \
                 LongName as OtherLongName
</code></pre>
<p>Without it Python will think the line is over and throw <code>SyntaxError</code>.</p>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module" rel="nofollow"><code>importlib.import_module</code></a> if you find operations on strings more convenient:</p>
<pre><code>from importlib import import_module
OtherLongName = import_module('some.very.long.package.name.LongName')
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">This is a readability problem also because the import statement is embedded in a function. Using the slash forces the next line to not use any indentation, which makes the result hard to read.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Never mind, my complaint is a tabs-versus-spaces problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@aestrivex you can also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>importlib</code></a> to operate with strings.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">importlib is a great suggestion. I dislike the slash operator aesthetically and think the importlib solution is a lot cleaner. thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh.  Still good to know.</span>
