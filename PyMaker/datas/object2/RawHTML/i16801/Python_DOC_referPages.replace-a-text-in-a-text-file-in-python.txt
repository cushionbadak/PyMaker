<p>I am trying to replace text in a text file (let's just call the file test.txt), here is the example text:</p>
<pre><code>Math is good
Math is hard
Learn good math
be good at math
DO\SOMETHING\NOW
</code></pre>
<p>I want something like: </p>
<pre><code>Math is good
Math is hard
Learn good science
be good at science
DO\SOMETHING\NOW
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to use fileinput in the following way</p>
<pre><code>import fileinput
file = fileinput.input("Path/To/File/text.txt", inplace=True)
for line in file:
    print(line.replace("math", "science"))
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that the print function automatically attaches "\n" so it skips a new line. I tried replacing with using "sys.stdout.write(line.replace("math", "science")) but that outputed numbers in the text file. So how do I do this efficiently so that I get the results I want. Should I just use open and go line by line and checking if the word "math" pops up and replace the word? Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can tell <code>print()</code> not to write a newline by setting the <code>end</code> keyword argument to an empty string:</p>
<pre><code>print(line.replace("math", "science"), end='')
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow">default value for <code>end</code> is <code>'\n'</code></a>.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could remove the newline from <code>line</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print(line.rstrip('\n').replace("math", "science"))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Actually it does change my file, so I don't think I need a temp file. Thanks for commenting though!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ahh sorry. I didn't see the fileinput part :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much that worked :) ... the first option, I haven't tried the second option but that is probably good to know both!</span>
