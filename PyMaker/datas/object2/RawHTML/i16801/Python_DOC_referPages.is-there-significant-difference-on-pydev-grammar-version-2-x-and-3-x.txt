<p>I'm working on writing unit test by Python, I found a plug-in named PyDev for Eclipse, but the problem is when I create a new project, I have to choose grammar version of Python bu I don't know which one should I select. Is there any significant difference about  version 2.x and 3.x  that may lead to more complex programming complexities?</p>

<p>There are enough differences to trip one up! Unless you are dealing with legacy code, go with Python 3.</p>
<p>"Python 2.x is legacy and Python 3 is the present and future version of Python" as stated on their website.</p>
<p>For the developer there are some differences in syntax he or she should be aware of.
Moreover, Python3 is intentionally backward incompatible, so the new features will not work in prior versions.</p>
<p>You can find out what's new in Python 3 here:
