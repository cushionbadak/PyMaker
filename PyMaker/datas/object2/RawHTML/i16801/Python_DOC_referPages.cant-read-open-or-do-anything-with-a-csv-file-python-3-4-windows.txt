<p>I am unable to open any CSV file produced by a program(I don't have full details of program), it comes out with file names like 266925.130314-88850999.word</p>
<p>The file is a csv, it opens in excel 2013 and all editors fine, I have tried opening with original file name, I have tried opening by changing extension from .word to .csv</p>
<p>Nothing works, I get the errors detailed below.</p>
<p>Sample Part of CSV</p>
<pre><code>"tes","","2PT26","",4,7,"TEST","SHEEP AND STUFFF                  1kg","",1.1111,9.9999,1,0.000,2.6900,0.0000,0.000,

<p>Full error Message in idle gui</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; open('C:\Console2\edz\test.csv', 'r', newline='', encoding='utf-8')
Traceback (most recent call last):

open('C:\Console2\edz\test.csv', 'r', newline='', encoding='utf-8')
OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument: 'C:\\Console2\\edz\test.csv'
</code></pre>
<p>Pandas error (not given full because its massive amount of text with traceback - can add if required)</p>
<pre><code>OSError: File b'C:\\Console2\\edz\test.csv' does not exist
</code></pre>
<p>I have tested this file exists with </p>
<pre><code>files = os.listdir("C:\Console2\edz")
print (files)

['report.csv', 'test.csv']
</code></pre>
<p>I can use EXACT same code with report.csv (this csv is a known working one not created by program) and it loads fine. </p>
<p>I do not understand why this file wont open, I have tried open/read_csv/read_excel, all produce same errors on both idle and pandas.</p>
<p>Pulling my hair out, please assist.</p>

<p>The issue here is that Python uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow">escapes</a> in strings - <code>'\t'</code> is a tab character, so when that sequence appears in your path, it changes meaning (note how in the output, the other backslashes have been escaped). Python is looking for <code>'C:\Console2\edz    est.csv'</code>.</p>
<p>The best solution is to use forward slashes for paths - Python will do the correct thing, even under Windows.</p>
<pre><code>open('C:/Console2/edz/test.csv', 'r', newline='', encoding='utf-8')
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use a raw string (<code>r'C:\Console2\edz\test.csv'</code>) or escape your backslashes (<code>'C:\\Console2\\edz\\test.csv'</code>) - but the former can't deal with trailing backslashes, and the latter is hard to read and write.</p>

<p><code>\t</code> is an escape character in python, try <code>\\t.</code> </p>
<pre><code>C:\\Console2\\edz\\test.csv
</code></pre>
<p>you can  also prefix the string with  <code>r</code> 'raw string' before the path  <code>(r'C:\Console2\edz\test.csv'','r')</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried reversing the the slashes and got an error, not got it to hand, and oddly enough i can't replicate it, just tested reversing slashes and that works to. Many thanks for the assistance.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kuzen It must have been another change that caused the error - Python definitely supports the use of forward slashes for paths on Windows, it's a documented feature.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I dont doubt this, been frustrated with this for hours I have been trying alsorts. Maybe next time ill come here before i go mad :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this fixes the problem, but i dont think it has anything to do with the t, because i can load the files now fine just by adding \\ example pd.read_csv("C:\Console2\edz\\wtfevah.bob      either way all fixed, many thanks!!!</span>
