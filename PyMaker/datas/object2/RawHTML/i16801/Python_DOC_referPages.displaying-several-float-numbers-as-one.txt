<p>For the life of me, I can't seem to get the numbers to add up! They are all printing separately. For example, it is displaying "That will be $95.00 $90 $8.50 for the ..." I think it's as simple as getting the bracket numbers correct.. but I can't seem to do it! </p>
<pre><code>print("That is " + str((formatC(pack[packageSelect-1]["adult"]*noAdult) + formatC(pack[packageSelect-1]["child"]*noChild) + (formatC(AREAS.get(delivery))))) + "for " + pack[packageSelect]["name"] +  " package for " + str(noAdult) + " " + adult + " and ", str(noChild) + " " + child + ",  delivered to " + str(deliveryArea.title()) + ".")
</code></pre>
<p>I want the "adult" + "child" + "delivery" to be a total.. not separate prices! </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are <em>adding up</em> the string representation of those numbers. The <code>+</code> operator for strings does concatenation. If you want to add the amounts you will have to do the addition while they are still <code>float</code> and then convert the result to string.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your are adding formatted strings; adding strings places them one after the other.</p>
<p>Add the <em>numbers</em> first:</p>
<pre><code>total = (
    pack[packageSelect-1]["adult"] * noAdult + 
    pack[packageSelect-1]["child"] * noChild + 
    AREAS.get(delivery))
print("That is " + str(formatC(total)) + "for " + pack[packageSelect]["name"] +  " package for " + str(noAdult) + " " + adult + " and ", str(noChild) + " " + child + ",  delivered to " + str(deliveryArea.title()) + ".")
</code></pre>
<p>You may want to study how you can format strings with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>str.format()</code></a>; it would make your printing code a whole lot simpler and more readable:</p>
<pre><code>print("That is {total} for {pack['name']} package for {noAdult} {adult} and {noChild} {child}, delivered to {area}.".format(
    total=formatC(total), pack=pack[packageSelect], noAdult=noAdult, adult=adult,
    noChild=noChild, child=child, area=deliveryArea.title()))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Then why not add the numbers <i>before</i> turning them to strings?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>formatC</code> here? Presumably that formats a floating point value?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's wrong with grasping the basics of programming (in general, not python specific) before asking questions about why strings do not add up like numbers? How more basic could it get?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sometimes it takes a little reminder to remember them. I'm very new to programming in general.. still trying to get my head around it. Probably could get a lot more basic.. like someone asking how to "print" something.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, formatC formats a floating point number. I have solved my query. Thank you :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OF COURSE! Thank you!!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Meg: sorry, you can only mark <i>one</i> answer as accepted per question. Glad we were both of help though!</span>
