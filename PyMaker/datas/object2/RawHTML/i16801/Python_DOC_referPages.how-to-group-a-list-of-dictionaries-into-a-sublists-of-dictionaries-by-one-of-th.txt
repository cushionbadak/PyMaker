<p>How to group a list of Dictionaries into a sublists of Dictionaries by one of their key-values?</p>
<p>For example, I'd like to change this list of Dictionaries into sublists of Dictionaries</p>
<pre><code>lst = [{'A':12,'B':32,'ID':333},{'Z':32,'C':43,'ID':111},{'D':43,'J':31,'ID':222},{'a':32,'b':31,'ID':222},{'D':43,'ID':333},{'a':89,'d':31,'ID':222},{'C':83,'ID':111}]


Desired_lst = [[{'A':12,'B':32,'ID':333},{'D':43,'ID':333}],[{'Z':32,'C':43,'ID':111},{'C':83,'ID':111}],[{'D':43,'J':31,'ID':222},{'a':32,'b':31,'ID':222},{'a':89,'d':31,'ID':222}]]
</code></pre>
<p>I've tried the following, which doesn't work, because I'm not sure how to apply groupby or sorted to a Dictionary. </p>
<pre><code>from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter


Desired_List = [list(grp) for key, grp in itertools.groupby(sorted(lst, key=operator.itemgetter(['ID'])),key=operator.itemgetter(['ID'))]
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think the issue with your current code is how you're calling <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.itemgetter" rel="nofollow"><code>itemgetter</code></a>. The arguments should be the keys to use to access the object, without any container. You're passing a list, which isn't a legal dictionary key. Try:</p>
<pre><code>keyfunc = operator.itemgetter("ID")
Desired_List = [list(grp) for key, grp in itertools.groupby(sorted(lst, key=keyfunc),
                                                            key=keyfunc)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What, if anything, have you tried so far? Also, this seems to be grouping, rather than sorting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Added what I tried, which I know works for list of lists, but I'm not sure how to apply it to a list of Dictionaries</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how are they sorted?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The original list of Dictionaries are not sorted in any particular way. It's pretty random.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean how do you want them sorted?</span>
