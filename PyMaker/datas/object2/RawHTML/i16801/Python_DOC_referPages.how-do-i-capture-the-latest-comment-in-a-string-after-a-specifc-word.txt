<p>Not sure what you mean (and your first code has <code>IndentationError</code>, by the way), but this might do the work:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(string.rsplit('Patch Set ', 1)[1].split('\n', 1)[1])

<p>Explanation: <code>.rsplit('Patch Set ', 1)[1]</code> splits at the last occurence of <code>Patch Set</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.rsplit" rel="nofollow"><code>rsplit</code></a>) and gets the second part (<code>[1]</code>), and <code>.split('\n', 1)[1]</code> splits at the first occurence of <code>\n</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.split" rel="nofollow"><code>split</code></a>) and gets the second par (<code>[1]</code>)</p>

<p>Its a little bit tricky.</p>
<p>Basicly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for last String Position of <code>"Patch Set "</code></li>
<li>Make a Substring, from this position to end</li>
<li>Search for second Position <code>\n</code>;</li>
<li>Again, make a Substring, from this position to end</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't know the functions in Python, but this should basicly do it.</p>
