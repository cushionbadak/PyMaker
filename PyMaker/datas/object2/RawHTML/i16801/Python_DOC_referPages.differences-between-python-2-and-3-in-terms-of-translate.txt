<p>I have question about translate function in python 3
(I am studying from a book that's for python 2)</p>
<p>In Python2, we do:</p>
<pre><code>from string import maketrans 
table = maketrans ('cs', 'kz')

"this is an incredible test".translate(table)
"this is an incredible test".translate(table, ' ')
</code></pre>
<p>How do we do it in python 3?  I know that:</p>
<pre><code>table = str.maketrans ('cs', 'kz')
"this is an incredible test".translate(table)
</code></pre>
<p>will works</p>
<p>But I can't seem to figure it out how to do the:</p>
<pre><code>"this is an incredible test".translate(table, ' ')
</code></pre>
<p>Is there anyway to do it? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python3 the <em>deletechars</em> are added as the third argument to <code>maketrans</code>, rather than as the second argument to <code>translate</code>. In both cases chars can be mapped to <code>None</code> when manually creating a unicode mapping dictionary to pass to <code>maketrans</code>)</p>
<pre><code># Python3
table = str.maketrans ('cs', 'kz', ' ')
"this is an incredible test".translate(table)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you read the relevant documentation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ermm... what do you mean the relevant documentation? (sorry, I am still new to programming)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.maketrans" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the relevant documentation</a> - basically googling for Python + <i>name-of-function</i> will almost always bring up the official Python documentation - then you just have to be careful it's for the right major version (3 rather than 2)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh yeah that.  I did remember seeing it before, perhaps I didn't pay too much attention.  But thanks for the help!</span>
