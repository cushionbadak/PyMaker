<p>So I'm trying to decide which of these is more efficient, or if there is a difference between them. The program I'm writing iterates through a for loop (python) and does some stuff, and then, depending on a flag, will write to a file.</p>
<p>Example A:</p>
<pre><code>for element in list:
    Do stuff
    if(write_to_file):
       write to file
</code></pre>
<p>Vs example B:</p>
<pre><code>for element in list:
    Do stuff
if(write_to_file):
    for element in list:
        write to file
</code></pre>
<p>In the case of A it has to check every time if it's true, but in the case of B if it is true it has to then re-do the for loop. My thought is that they're equal, but I'd like opinions of more experienced programmers</p>

<p>Based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation" rel="nofollow">Big O</a> complexity analysis of your example(s):</p>
<pre><code>for element in list:
    Do stuff
if(write_to_file):
    for element in list:
        write to file
</code></pre>
<p>The above is less efficient because you are iterating over <code>list</code> twice.</p>
<p>i.e: <code>O(n) x 2</code></p>
<p>But please test yourself, use the <code>timeit</code> module and most importantly of all you are worrying prematurely about optimization. <em>get it working first!</em></p>

<p>Example C:</p>
<pre><code>if(write_to_file):
    for element in list:
        Do stuff
        write to file
else:
    for element in list:
        Do stuff
</code></pre>
<p>As others have said, you will probably not be able notice the difference between any of these approaches.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You are writing to a file, ergo, you are worrying over something that'll fall into nothingness compared to the time the I/O takes. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use timeit and find out: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's no substitute for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">testing it yourself</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IanAuld, Henry Keiter: Thanks, I didn't know that function existed. Will do</span>
<span class="comment-copy">check out ipython if you haven't yet...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If <code>write_to_file</code> is false, this is <i>more</i> efficient, because there's only a single loop iteration <i>and</i> the condition is checked only once, rather than each time through the loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Except for when it's <code>True</code>. Yes it all depends. The OP has not provided any specifics so this is the best answer I can provide based on what I see :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JamesMills, it's based on user input so completely random. Based on your input and the input in the comments on the OP I tried using timeit on it:  Example A: Write_to_file = false: 18.05 ms write_to_file = true:  18.60 ms  Ex B: Write to file = true:19.4 ms Writeto file = false: 18.27 ms  Not much difference. And don't worry, it was working before I asked!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@musher: user input is anything but completely random!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BenjaminHodgson I'm actually curious about this - what do you mean?</span>
