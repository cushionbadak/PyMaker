<p>I have 2 python files. file1.py and file2.py </p>
<p>file1.py</p>
<p><code>print "file1"</code></p>
<p>file2.py</p>
<p><code>import file1
print "file2"</code></p>
<p>and when i run file2,the output is </p>
<p>file1
file2</p>
<p>The question may seem little naive but i want to know what exactly is happening here.</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance.</p>

<p>Yes.
When importing a file it is being run.
To avoid this, file1.py can be:</p>
<pre><code>if __name__=='__main__':
    print 'file1'
</code></pre>
<p>And then the text will be printed only if file1.py is the main file being run directly.</p>
</div>

<p>In a sense yes. When you import a file, you will run all the script and you will also initialize all the methods.</p>
<p>To ensure that code is only run when the file is run directly and <em>not</em> when it is imported. You should put all your main code in <code>main()</code> and do it as:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    #all your main code here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>The import statement combines two operations; it searches for the named module, then it binds the results of that search to a name in the local scope. The search operation of the import statement is defined as a call to the <strong>import</strong>() function, with the appropriate arguments. The return value of <strong>import</strong>() is used to perform the name binding operation of the import statement. See the import statement for the exact details of that name binding operation.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">import file using python</a></p>
<p>To print 'file2' your code, you need to pass it as a command to the Python interpreter,</p>
<pre><code>python myscript.py
</code></pre>
<p>there's no <code>main()</code> function that gets run automatically, so the <code>main()</code> function is implicitly all the code at the top level, and call <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code></p>
