<p>I'm running into a weird error trying to install Django on my computer.</p>
<p>This is the sequence that I've typed into my command line:</p>

Cleaning up...

C:\Python34&gt;pip install Django

<p><strong>You need to add the path of your pip installation to your PATH system variable</strong>. By default, pip is installed to <code>C:\Python34\Scripts\pip</code> (pip now comes bundled with new versions of python), so the path "C:\Python34\Scripts" needs to be added to your PATH variable.</p>
<p>To check if it is already in your PATH variable, type <code>echo %PATH%</code> at the CMD prompt</p>
<p><strong>To add the path of your pip installation to your PATH variable</strong>, you can use the Control Panel or the <code>setx</code> command. For example:</p>
<pre><code>setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Python34\Scripts"
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:
According to the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755104%28v=ws.11%29.aspx">official documentation</a>, "[v]ariables set with setx variables are available in future command windows only, not in the current command window". In particular, <em>you will need to start a new cmd.exe instance</em> after entering the above command in order to utilize the new environment variable. </p>
<p>Thanks to Scott Bartell for pointing this out.</p>

<p><strong>Alternate way.</strong></p>
<p>If you don't want to add the PATH as the previous well written answers pointed out, </p>
<p>but you want to execute pip as your command then you can do that with <code>py -m</code> as prefix.</p>
<p>Given that you have to do it again and again.</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<pre><code>py -m &lt;command&gt;

<p>as in</p>
<pre><code>py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

<p>Also make sure to have <code>pip</code> and <code>py</code> installed</p>

<p>I realize this is an old question, but I was having the same problem just now. After adding the proper folder (<code>C:\Python33\Scripts</code>) to the path, I still could not get <code>pip</code> to run. All it took was running

<code>pip install -package-</code>. Just a thought. </p>

<p>Even I'm new to this but, C:\Python34\Scripts&gt;pip install django ,worked for me. The path should be set as where the Script folder of Python installation is i.e.<strong>C:\Python34\Scripts</strong>. I suppose its because django is a framework which is based on python that's why this directory structure has to be maintained while installing.</p>

<p>I continued to recieve this error after correcting my PATH.</p>
<p>If your codebase requires that you have an earlier version of Python (2.7 in my case), it may have been a version prior to the existence of pip.</p>
<p>It's not very canonical but installing a more recent version worked for me. (I used 2.7.13) </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I had this same issue. You just need to go to your </p>

<p>I think from Python 2.7.9 and higher pip comes pre installed and it will be in your scripts folder.  So you have to add the "scripts" folder to the path.  Mine is installed in C:\Python27\Scripts.  Check yours to see what your path is so that you can alter the below accordingly, then Go to powershell, paste the below code in powershell and hit Enter key.  After that, reboot and your issue will be resolved.</p>
<pre><code>[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27\Scripts", "User")

<p>A very simple way to get around this is to open the path where pip is installed in file explorer, and click on the path, then type cmd, this sets the path, allowing you to install way easier.</p>

<p>Small clarification: in "Windows 7 64 bit PC", after adding <code>...Python34\Scripts</code> to the path variable, <code>pip install pygame</code> didn't work for me.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You may need to add pip to the PATH environment variable. Otherwise CMD prompt doesn't know what you're talking about</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what's the output of <code>echo %PATH%</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm I'm relatively new to programming have only done some ruby on rails. Can you explain a bit more what you mean by PATH environment variable? How?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@fr1tz I get a huge output... seemingly a really really long directory of files</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3597960 do you know the location of your pip installation? You need to add this location to that really really long list of directories, which is actually the PATH system variable. To add it to the PATH variable you can either use <code>setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\pip"</code> for example or you can add it via the control panel</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! Saved me big time!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@fr1tz, the command did not work when being added from the cmd utility. I had to add it manually from system settings&gt;advanced&gt;environment variables. I am using Windows 8 64bit. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Mohammed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note: you'll likely need to close and reopen your CMD prompt after you run the setx command.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For python 3.5 installed on Windows 10, the path is: C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It worked. Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think this answer is the cleanest solution if you already have the path of python set up in your system variable. (Y)</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Best Answer! Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this worked for me on windows 10 laptop with latest OS, i was using CMDER as my emulator</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is better to set pip in environment variables. Your method would make it restricted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I installed python 3 and pip3 works. Why this answer has downvote?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The first link will not solve the problem. Clearly the OP is able to use <code>python</code> command in the CMD prompt without the 'python is not recognized as an internal or external command' error. The second link is general instructions on how to install pip. The OP has obviously already installed pip and is having an issue in using pip.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">should I uninstall and reinstall?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">user3597950 pip command is not recognised by the w-pc, this actually due to the python path and pip install conflict, make sure the env path is added correctly, for 2.7-"c:\Python27\Scripts;" , and try to reinstall the pip.</span>
