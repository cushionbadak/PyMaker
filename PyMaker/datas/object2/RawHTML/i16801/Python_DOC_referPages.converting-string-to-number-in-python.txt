<p>I have a file in .ktx format. I have opened the file in 'rb' mode. I want to modify particular bytes in that file. I am reading bytes using read(4) [ i want to read number which is of 4 bytes],  call and convert each chunk into a number. What I want is, to increase that number by specific number and insert it back into file stream. Is there any function in python which converts a byte string to an integer? I tried with int() but it prints some binary data.</p>
<p>my code:</p>
<pre><code>bytes=file.read(4)
for char in bytes:
    print hex(ord(char))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>bytes = file.read(4)
bytesAsInt = struct.unpack("l",bytes)
do_something_with_int(bytesAsInt)
</code></pre>
<p>I think might be what you are looking for ... its hard to tell from the question though</p>
<p>here is the docs on the struct module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html</a></p>

<p>Here is a suggested workflow for what you seem to be wanting to do</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the data</li>
<li>Convert the data to integer</li>
<li>Add X to the integer, where X is the value you want to increase by</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">are you talking about binary string or what kind of string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah, binary string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Has the question been clarified now? I'd like to post an extended answer but cannot at the moment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>struct</code> is definitely the way to go, you can even read from the file stream directly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how can I write back that into file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">with <code>struct.pack</code> ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The OP is dealing with packed binary data, not python <code>int</code>s.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Bytes are characters no matter which language you are programming in, failing to see how converting a char to a corresponding numeric value is not applicable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In his own example, he is iterating one char at a time. so this fits with his actual work so far.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">He is iterating one char at a time <i>incorrectly</i>, so posting another incorrect answer that follows his method is not useful.</span>
