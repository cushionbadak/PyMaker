<p>The following is what I have so far:  I know I need to total the numbers in the file numberGood.txt after I change the amount to a float, but the numbers don't have variable names, ie. num1, num2 because the number of files is unknown to the program.  I've solved that issue with a while-loop, but how do I get the sum of all the numbers?</p>
<p>*numberGood.txt is a list of various integers that I need to sum in my program.</p>
<p>If anyone could explain and/or give me an example, I'd be very grateful.</p>
<pre><code>def main(): 
    goodNum = open("numberGood.txt",'r')
    input("Enter file name.")
    line = goodNum.readline()
    while line != "":
    amount = float(line)
    print(format(amount, '.1f'))
    line = goodNum.readline()
    print("The total is: ", amount)
    goodNum.close()
main()
</code></pre>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow"><code>sum()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>with open("numberGood.txt") as f:
    print(sum(float(line) for line in f))
</code></pre>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat numberGood.txt 
10.01
19.99
30.0
40
$ python3
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open("numberGood.txt") as f:
...     print(sum(float(line) for line in f))
... 
100.0

<p>You can add them in a list and then return the sum of the list as follows:</p>
<pre><code>def main(): 
    goodNum = open("numberGood.txt",'r')
    lst = []
    for line in goodNum:
        lst.append(float(line))
        print(format(lst[-1], '.1f'))
    print("The total is: ", sum(lst))
    goodNum.close()

main()
</code></pre>
</div>
