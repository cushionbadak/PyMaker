<p>I'm really new to Python and to OSMnx as well. I'm trying to figure out how this package works, my ultimate goal would be to be able to create shapefiles from a list of streets and I hope this package can get me closer to this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've already had problems with running the example code for getting street network for a single city.</p>
<p>This is how the example code starts:</p>
<pre><code>import osmnx as ox
%matplotlib inline
ox.config(log_file=False, log_console=True, use_cache=True)
</code></pre>
<p>and then this is I'd like to run:</p>
<pre><code># get walking network from Szigethalom
G = ox.graph_from_place('Szigethalom, Hungary', network_type = 'walk')
fig, ax = ox.plot_graph(G)
</code></pre>
<p>and the error message is this:</p>
<p><img alt="Error message - part 1" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ENMDE.png"/></p>
<p><img alt="Error message - part 2" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sHvxK.png"/></p>
<p>I use the win7 and jupyter framework.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<p>Your issue appears to be that pyproj is not installed properly. I see you've answered your question, but there's a somewhat simpler answer. If you have installation problems such as this, you can follow the <a href="https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OSMnx instructions</a> that state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have any trouble with the installation, try installing OSMnx in a new, clean virtual environment using conda and conda-forge:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>conda create --override-channels -c conda-forge -n OSMNX python=3
osmnx source activate OSMNX
</code></pre>

<p>With some help of RunOrVeith I figured out a way which is working now.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I use Python 3.6 instead of 3.7.</p></li>
<li><p>I created a virtual environment following <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/environment-management-with-conda-python-2-3-b9961a8a5097" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> site, using <em>conda</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>I installed in the newly created environment <strong>geopandas</strong>, <strong>rtree</strong> and <strong>osmnx</strong>, following <a href="https://geoffboeing.com/2016/11/osmnx-python-street-networks/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> blog article, using <em>conda install -c conda-forge nameofpackage</em></p></li>
<li><p>I run the code above in my question.</p></li>

<span class="comment-copy">It works for me (in IPython, not a Notebook). What python version are you using? I had some troubles with 3.7, but it works with 3.6.3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">According to <a href="https://github.com/jswhit/pyproj/issues/134" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this issue</a>, it might also be a problem of the anaconda install. Can you try it in a virtualenv? You can see how to create one <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RunOrVeith I use Python 3.7. I just reinstalled anaconda the other day. I'll try the virtualenv.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you try the following in the terminal (assuming problem.py contains the 4 lines of python above, without the matplotlib inline): <code>python3 -m venv test</code> <code>source test/bin/activate</code> <code>pip install osmnx</code> <code>python problem.py</code> and see if that works? You might also have to <code>sudo apt install python3-rtree</code> for osmnx to work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RunOrVeith  Thanks for your suggestion, however it doesn't seem to work. I run into other problems in the new virtual environment (created by this way: <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/environment-management-with-conda-python-2-3-b9961a8a5097" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>): installing of the osmnx doesn't work at all with pip (and besides installing rtree nothing really works with pip), so I'm trying to install geopandas (as a dependency of osmnx) and osmnx with conda.   What is the difference between pip and sudo apt install?  Is sudo apt install for windows?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks a lot for your advice! with a lot of trial and error, this clean, new virtual environment was the way I could use your package. unfortunately I didn't read this part of OSMnx instructions, before I asked here, but now, everything is fine.</span>
