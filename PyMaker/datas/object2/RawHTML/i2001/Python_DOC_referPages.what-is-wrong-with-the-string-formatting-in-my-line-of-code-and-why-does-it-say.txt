<p>I've just recently started coding and came across this problem which I can not seem to solve. This is my code: </p>
<pre><code>name = input("What is your name? ")
quest = input("What is your quest? ")
color =input("What is your favorite color? ")
print ("Ah, so your name is %s, your quest is %s, ") \
("and your favorite color is %s." % (name, quest, color))
</code></pre>
<p>and this is the problem:</p>
<pre><code>line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
  ("and your favorite color is %s.") % (name, quest, color)
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Remove the extra paretheses and have something like </p>
<pre><code>print ("Ah, so your name is %s, your quest is %s, \

and your favorite color is %s." % (name, quest, color))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is that you are not using the line separation operator properly, so you are treating the result of print, which is <code>None</code>, as a callable. </p>
<p>Look at the following:</p>
<pre><code>print ("Ah, so your name is %s, your quest is %s, ")
</code></pre>
<p>That will print:</p>
<pre><code>Ah, so your name is %s, your quest is %s,
</code></pre>
<p>and calling <code>print</code> will return <code>None</code>, so following your code you will have:</p>
<pre><code>None("and your favorite color is %s." % (name, quest, color))
</code></pre>
<p>which is generating this error.</p>
<p>You can solve this problem by:</p>
<pre><code>print ("Ah, so your name is %s, your quest is %s, "
    "and your favorite color is %s." % (name, quest, color))
</code></pre>
<p>I strongly encourage you to use f-string if you are using Python 3.6+:</p>
<pre><code>name = input("What is your name? ")
quest = input("What is your quest? ")
color = input("What is your favorite color? ")

print(f"Ah, so your name is {name}, your quest is {quest}, and your favorite color is {color}")
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how using f-strings improves the readability of your code.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the <code>.format()</code> or the even <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">formatted string interpolation</a>:</p>
<pre><code>name = input("What is your name? ")
quest = input("What is your quest? ")
color =input("What is your favorite color? ")
print ("Ah, so your name is {}, your quest is {}, and your favorite color is {}"
       .format(name, quest, color))
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>print (f"Ah, so your name is {name}, your quest is {quest}, "\
       "and your favorite color is {color}")
</code></pre>
<p>for:</p>
<pre><code>What is your name? What is your quest? What is your favorite color? Ah, so your name is a, your quest is b, and your favorite color is c
