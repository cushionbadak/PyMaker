<p>I'm trying to implement parallelism using python. </p>
<p>I'm using VS 2017 with python version 3.7.</p>
<p>My code as below:</p>
<pre><code>def do_parallelization(self, link_list):
    cpus = multi.cpu_count()
    workers = []
    page_bins = self.__get_chunks(cpus, link_list)

    array_s = Array(c_wchar_p,3)
    for cpu in range(cpus):
    #sys.stdout.write("CPU " + str(cpu) + "\n")
    # Process that will send corresponding list of pages 
    # to the function perform_extractionpage_bins[cpu]
        try:
            worker = multi.Process(name=str(cpu), target= self.get_page_content_para, args=(page_bins[cpu], array_s))
            worker.daemon = True
            workers.append(worker)
        except Exception as e:
            print(e)

    for worker in workers:
        worker.start()
    for worker in workers:
        worker.join()
    print (array_s[:])


def get_page_content_para(self, link_list, array_s):
    array_s[:] = ["up", "down", "left"] 
</code></pre>
<p>In here I'm trying to update <code>Array</code> but at the end of calling function, I print the array it gives me below output:</p>
<pre><code>["","",""]
</code></pre>
<p>I have searched in internet but all are saying it should update the variable.
Am I missing something?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I can get expexted result when i put </p>
<pre><code>worker.start()
worker.join()
</code></pre>
<p>under the </p>
<pre><code>worker = multi.Process(name=str(cpu), target= self.get_page_content_para, args=(page_bins[cpu], array_s))
</code></pre>
<p>but when i put as mentioned is that truly doing parallelism ?</p>
<p>as i understand when is rewrite as mentioned it is executing one by one manner , i mean one process start , end it and then second process is started .</p>
<p>is this parallelism ?</p>
<p>can anyone explain this?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">i have tried , . but no chance , thi method is inside a class , is that affect to the process?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It could, but it's hard to say without a MCVE. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example</a>.</span>
