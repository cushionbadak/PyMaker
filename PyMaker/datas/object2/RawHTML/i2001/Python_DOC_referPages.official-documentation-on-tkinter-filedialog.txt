<p>Where can I find official documentation on <code>tkinter.filedialog</code> module including all the methods and options?</p>
<p>Here I can find just a reference to it.</p>

<p>Those options are the same used by the tk/tcl toolkit. Python just passes the options to that library, while opening the corresponding dialogs. See for example options for the correponding tk_chooseDir dialog in <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.7/TkCmd/chooseDirectory.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. Pass your options as keywords without the <code>-</code>. More help for other widgets <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.7/TkCmd/contents.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>import tkinter.filedialog</code> and then <code>help(tkinter.filedialog)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@progmatico, In that, it informs about the functions like <code>askdirectory(**options)</code> but does not tell about the options available in it. Where can I find the details of options?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">If the question was answered you can post the answer yourself and mark it as accepted. This will make it clear for everyone that your problem was solved (and you get some points with it).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@progmatico, can you please add your comment as answer?</span>
