<p>i need help to make a script contain two process by python:
find each text in new folder and replace all double space to 1 tab and do it again to replace every double tab to 1 tab.</p>
<pre><code>import fnmatch 
import os 
rootPath = "D:\A\B" 
pattern = '*.txt' 
for root, dirs, files in os.walk("D:\A\B"): 
    for filename in fnmatch.filter(files, pattern): 
        print(os.path.join(filename))
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>glob</code></a> package is probably a bit more concise that what you're using. Then just open up the files, read the text in, replace what you want to replace and write it back to the same file.</p>
<p>Be careful when editing files in place -- if you use this in the wrong place you could cause some serious damage.</p>
<pre><code>import os
import glob

root_path = r'D:\a\b'  # use raw strings so \ is not escape character
patten = r'**\*.txt'

for path in glob.iglob(os.path.join(root_path, pattern), recursive=True):

    # open the file to read and replace
    with open(path) as fr:
        text = fr.read().replace('  ', '\t').replace('\t\t', '\t')

    # open the file to overwrite
    with open(path, 'w') as fw:
        path.write(text)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">do you mean tab?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And what have you tried so far?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't put code in a comment -- edit you're question in future. I've done it for you this time :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">im still beginner</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use <code>tabnanny</code>, just iterate over all files and call tabnanny with the required parameters: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tabnanny.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/tabnanny.html</a></span>
