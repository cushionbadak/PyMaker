<p>I don't understand why Python don't save results correctly, while it prints it correct. Code look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open("dataset_1.csv", "r") as WBI:
    data = csv.reader(WBI, delimiter = ";")
    data = list(data)

header = data[0]
data = data[1:]
WaterBandIndex = []

for row in data:
    WaterBandIndex.append(float(row[54])/float(row[83]))

print (WaterBandIndex)

with open("WBI.csv", "w+") as WBI:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(WaterBandIndex, delimiter = "|", lineterminator = "\n")
    csvwriter.writerows(WaterBandIndex)
</code></pre>
<p>Printed results are correct, but saves to csv nothing.
I'm green in programming.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The code should work if your variable <code>WaterBandIndex</code> is not empty.</p>
<pre><code>import csv
WaterBandIndex = ['1','2','3']

with open("WBI.csv", "w") as f:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(f , delimiter = "|", lineterminator = "\n")
    csvwriter.writerows(WaterBandIndex)

<span class="comment-copy">You are using <code>WaterBandIndex</code> both as filename and as data? See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv.writer</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Shouldn't it be <code>csvwriter = csv.writer(WBI,... </code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>"w+"</code> is the wrong file mode. Use <code>"w"</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've already tested @SpghttCd advise. It returns the sequence expected error in the last line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're getting an error, you should post it along with the full traceback.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">WaterBandIndex is not empty. I can print correct data it contains in 'print WaterBandIndex' line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Rather if the structure of your list is the same as mine above, it should work with yours. You can test is out and let me know if it works for you.</span>
