<p>I'm trying to take data from a csv file, print it out, and create new files.</p>
<pre><code>from csv import*

    for i in data:

    total = []
    for i in data:
        if i == year:
            total.append[i]
    return total

<p>This is the current code I have. When i run it it gives me most of the code i need, but then gives me an error.</p>

<p>And i've never seen that kind of error message. Any help is appreciated.<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dYROW.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Correct output of the code</a></p>

<p>You could have an element less than zero in your data which could also throw this error <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">it looks as if <code>data</code> may be empty and that is why it is complaining about needing at least one data point</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that has nothing to do with <code>csv</code>. You're feeding <code>mean</code> with empty data. It's possible that your csv file has empty rows</span>
<span class="comment-copy">btw <code>csvFile = writer(filename, delimiter=',')</code> doesn't work. You have to open the file then pass the handle to <code>csv.writer</code> object, not the filename (a problem you'll have later :))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As an aside, the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP8 guide</a> recommends against using <code>*</code> in your imports, rather using <code>import csv</code> than <code>from csv import *</code> as the latter can clutter and confuse the namespace</span>
