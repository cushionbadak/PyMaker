<p>since beginning with Python, I have run into this problem multiple times while trying to install and use different packages. In this case, I've been trying to install geopy. I used:</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install geopy
</code></pre>
<p>and got :</p>
<pre><code>Collecting geopy

Collecting geographiclib&lt;2,&gt;=1.49 (from geopy)
Installing collected packages: geographiclib, geopy
Successfully installed geographiclib-1.49 geopy-1.17.0
</code></pre>
<p>Next, I tried to make sure it installed, but I got:</p>
<pre><code>geopy --version
geopy: command not found
</code></pre>
<p>I tried </p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python-geopy

<p>I also tried using it in Jupyter Notebooks:
    import geopy</p>
<pre><code>   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ModuleNotFoundError                       Traceback (most recent call last)
    &lt;ipython-input-1-99b9d2081153&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
    ----&gt; 1 import geopy

    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'geopy'
</code></pre>
<p>I am not sure, because noob, but I think it might have something to do with the fact Python 2.7 was by default installed with my distribution of Ubuntu, and I installed Python3 and have been using it instead. I added Python = Python3 in the first line of ~/.bashrc in hopes of fixing that. This has happened numerous times before to me with other packages. Please help. Any criticism is welcomed, sorry if I didn't conform to stackoverflow etiquette in any way (still a noob).</p>

<p>I think that Your problem may be fixed with virtual env. Just create Venv, and then use "python" from there. Look here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html</a></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<ol>
<li><p>type 'python -V' in shell and run, see if the default env is your wanted</p></li>
<li><p>if you've created virtual env, make sure you created correctly and do not !!! move the env !!! </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Try the command as below in your notebook.<br/>
Maybe you installed in the different python with Jupiter environment.</p>
<pre><code>!pip3 install geopy
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">try the command <code>python --version</code>. This will display your environment python version</span>
