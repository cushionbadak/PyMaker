<p>I'm new to python and found some object lists while using djnago queries like </p>
<pre><code> querysetObj = &lt;QuerySet [&lt;class: obj1&gt;, &lt;class: obj2&gt;]&gt;
 queryset=&lt;QuerySet [&lt;class: obj1&gt;, &lt;class: obj3&gt;,&lt;class:obj4&gt;]&gt;
 for obj in querysetObj:
   queryset|=obj 
 queryset=&lt;QuerySet [&lt;class: obj1&gt;, &lt;class: obj3&gt;,&lt;class:obj4&gt;,&lt;class:obj2]&gt;#it acts like a set compare objects and add none repeated objects only 
</code></pre>
<p>I want to know how to do the same design with other objects "my own classes", is this related to operators overloading like c++ and if so , how to do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do it by implementing the special <code>__or__</code> method (and possibly also <code>__ror__</code>), as described <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<pre><code>class Foo:
    def __or__(self, other):
        return "Orred Foo"
    def __ror__(self, other):
        return "Rorred Foo"

Foo() | Foo()
# =&gt; 'Orred Foo'
Foo() | 7
# =&gt; 'Orred Foo'
7 | Foo()
# =&gt; 'Rorred Foo'
</code></pre>
<p>If the left operand has <code>__or__</code> defined, its <code>__or__</code> method is invoked. If it doesn't, or <code>__or__</code> threw <code>NotImplemented</code>, then the right operand's <code>__ror__</code> is invoked.</p>
<p>Other operators are implemented similarly, using the various special functions.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">it does work , and I already tried check django</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Querysets aren't lists, they're querysets. See for example the django ticket for where they were added to the <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/21333" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I want to do the same design but with normal classes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you , I'm checking it with my own classes</span>
