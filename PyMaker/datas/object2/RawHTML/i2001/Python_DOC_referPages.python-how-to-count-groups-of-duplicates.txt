<p>I'm new to python and the problem I'm facing is how can I count groups of duplicates. For example given a list like this:</p>
<p><code>['down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']</code> </p>
<p>I have to calculate the following:</p>
<p><code>[('down', 3), ('up', 1), ('right', 2), ('down', 2)]</code></p>
<p>Or rather how can I achieve this in a pythonic way coming from languages like java/c#?</p>
<p>EDIT: Since it seems that I didn't clarify my my problem enough, I don't want to count all the occurrences of for example <code>down</code> in the list, but only those that are neighbors (if that is the correct phrasing), so <code>Counter(my_list)</code> doesn't give the desired output. </p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.groupby</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import itertools
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = ['down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [(value, sum(1 for _ in group)) for value, group in itertools.groupby(lst)]
[('down', 3), ('up', 1), ('right', 2), ('down', 2)]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Try This:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import groupby
[(c,len(list(cgen))) for c,cgen in groupby(a)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the data structure you expect to get? because what you asked is not a valid one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It should have been {'down' : 3, 'up' : 1, 'right' : 2, 'down' : 2} right? Like a Hashmap in java</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Still not valid, you can't have 'down' twice in a dict</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MaorRefaeli sorry, I hope that it's good now with using a tuple.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">List of tuples is a better data structure for your implementation</span>
<span class="comment-copy">could you please elaborate as to have that solution works?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>groupby</code> gives group of same element like: <code>[('down', &lt;itertools._grouper at 0x7f4438b1b320&gt;),  ('up', &lt;itertools._grouper at 0x7f4438b1b6d8&gt;),  ('right', &lt;itertools._grouper at 0x7f4438b1b5f8&gt;),  ('down', &lt;itertools._grouper at 0x7f4438b1b278&gt;)] </code> So for each print the element and length of group.</span>
