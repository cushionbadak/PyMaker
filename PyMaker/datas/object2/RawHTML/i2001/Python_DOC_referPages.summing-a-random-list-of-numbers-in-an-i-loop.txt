<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've created a program that generates a list of numbers of users choice, between 1 and 500. The program then writes the list to a file, reads the file, and lists all the numbers. I need to sum the numbers and show the count. Here is my code...</p>
<pre><code>numberFile = open("random_number.txt", "w" )

for i in range(int(input("How many random numbers?: "))):
   numbers = str(randint(1, 500))
   numberFile.write(numbers)
   print(numbers)


numberFile.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can add this to your code.</p>
<pre><code>numberFile = open("random_number.txt", "r" )
sum = 0
for i in numberFile:
    sum += int(i)

print(sum)
</code></pre>
<p>At first, sum is 0. The program reads each value and adds the value to sum.</p>

<p>If you want <strike>pythonic</strike> cryptic code, you can do this in 2 * 2 lines (+1 line of import):</p>
<pre><code>import random

# create file
with open("t.txt","w") as nf:
    nf.write( '\n'.join(map(str,random.choices(range(1,501),
                                               k=int(input("How many numbers?"))))))
</code></pre>
<p>The first one uses the inputted value, makes it an int, uses it as "how many" parameter to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random.choices()</a> which returns as much random numbers from the given <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">range (1,501)</a> which are then fed into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow noreferrer">map()</a> to make them strings so <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer">join()</a> can make a big string of them wich is then written into the file.</p>
<pre><code># read / sum file
with open("t.txt","r") as nf:
    print(sum(map(int,(x.strip() for x in nf.readlines() if x.strip()) ) ) )
</code></pre>
<p>This reads the whole file as list of lines, strips the newlines, converts them into ints and sums them. (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Doku built-in functions for int, map, sum</a> )</p>
<hr/>
<p>Outputting the generated stuff:</p>
<pre><code>with open("t.txt","r") as nf: 
    print(nf.read())
</code></pre>
<p>Sum:</p>
<pre><code>2371
</code></pre>
<p>Outputfile:</p>
<pre><code>320

138
112
369

<span class="comment-copy">Where is the summation happening ?  I come from a JAVA background and so I am not familiar with python syntax but I would expect some kind addition accumulation logic</span>
<span class="comment-copy">1) create another variable initially set to 0 and keep adding the values to it. 2) append the values in a list and use <code>sum(my_list)</code></span>
