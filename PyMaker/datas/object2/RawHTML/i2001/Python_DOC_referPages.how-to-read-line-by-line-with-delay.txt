<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have txt file with a list of words, and i want to read:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each word (from the txt file) with delay of 10 sec, and to "Do something". Then read the second word and "Do something" etc.</li>
<li>Four words (at the same time) with the same delay.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am using Python27.</p>
<p>My code is:</p>
<pre><code># Read text file
with open('D:\My_Path.txt', 'r') as fp:
lines = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in fp.readlines()]
time.sleep(10)  # does not work well
for line in lines:
    print (line)

def AB ():
    '''Do something'''
AB ()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Add <code>import time</code> at the beginning and e.g. <code>time.sleep(.3)</code> before <code>print(line)</code>.</p>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">You can use the <code>time.sleep(10)</code> function which puts in a delay of 10 seconds before executing the next instructions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The common way to introduce delays in code execution  is Python is by calling <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time.sleep()</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ Karl, i did it, but still i did not read each word by word with delay.</span>
