<p>The example below works in Python2 but not in Python3. Is there an equivalent method for overloading the <code>__name__</code> of a class in Python3? See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11769020/is-it-possible-to-override-name-derived-from-object?answertab=votes#tab-top">related question</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(object):
...    pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; Foo.__name__ = 'Bar'
&gt;&gt;&gt; Foo
&lt;class '__main__.Foo'&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python 3.3 and up use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#definition.__qualname__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__qualname__</code> attribute</a> to form the class represenation string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo: pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; Foo.__name__ = '__name__ for Foo'
&gt;&gt;&gt; Foo.__qualname__ = '__qualname__ for Foo'
&gt;&gt;&gt; Foo
&lt;class '__main__.__qualname__ for Foo'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You probably want to set <em>both</em> <code>__name__</code> and <code>__qualname__</code>, but only the latter has any effect on the string output you are looking for. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the answer! I'm actually interested in overriding the name of the particular object obj = Foo() rather than the class itself. Hence why the example was stated the way it was before your edit.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! It doesn't answer my question as it was originally posed though (or maybe I just don't understand how?). Is it possible to override the <b>name</b> of the object obj = Foo() as well?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jmc: When you set attributes on <code>obj.__class__</code>, you are setting them on <code>Foo</code>. When you echo <code>obj</code> or print <code>repr(obj)</code>, then the <code>repr(obj.__class__)</code> result is used to produce the output. While you can set the <code>__name__</code> attribute on <code>Foo</code> just <i>fine</i> (so also <code>obj.__class__.__name__</code>), setting that attribute has no effect on how <code>repr(Foo)</code> and <code>repr(obj)</code> are formed.  That is determined by <code>__qualname__</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jmc: If that doesn't answer what you are asking them I'm really not sure why you are asking about <code>__name__</code>.</span>
