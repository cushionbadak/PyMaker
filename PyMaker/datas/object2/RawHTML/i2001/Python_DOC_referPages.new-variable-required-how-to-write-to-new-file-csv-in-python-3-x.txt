<p>I am working with statistics in a library environment - and recording some monthly numbers (fairly new to programming and python). Using an opportunity to learn some python where the process in the old ILS was read in perl.</p>
<p>The scenario is:</p>
<p>a. I have an output from an oracle report that will be saved as a csv file
b. That file is opened and lines are split so the strings are hashable.
c. Using indexes, those strings are iterated, counted, and, using a dictionary, meanings are attached. My output using print() is exactly what I need it to be (the results are simple and easily readable by everyone).</p>
<p>But I am having a hard time turning this output into writable lines in a new file.</p>
<pre><code>for stat in dataSet:
statCount = stat_reader.count(stat)
name = team[stat[:3]]
code = codes[stat[-3:]]

    #for line in sorted(m_stats):
print(name + ': ' + code + ': ' + str(statCount))
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried input(''), csv.writer, csv.DictWriter, and other things in order to move that perfectly fine and printable output to a usable variable for writing as printed to a new file...</p>
<p>What am I missing (or am I over-thinking it?)</p>
<p>Also, I am expecting to output in .csv, but would be happy to output in .odt or .docx</p>
<p>::</p>
<p>Slight bit of follow-up</p>
<p>Running the exact same fixed script from yesterday (data is clean, all the key/value pairs are in the dictionary, etc) - but today, on another month's data, ONLY the FINAL line of output to the .csv file.</p>
<p>In addition, each time I run the script, I get zero errors in either cdm or pycharm and the output is a different result.</p>
<p>In addition (2.0), These results I describe here are the same in different directories (running from either cmd or pycharm)</p>
<p>This strikes me as odd.
Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>import csv
with open('out.csv', 'wb') as csvfile:
   writer = csv. writer(csvfile, delimiter=':')
   #for stat in dataSet: # I guess that was your point - if so uncomment this line and add indent to line below
   writer.writerow([name, code, str(statCount)])
