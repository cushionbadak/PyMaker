<p>I'm working on Visual studio about Python project. I have a module calls <code>"module1.py"</code> and main window <code>"TestForPython.py"</code></p>
<p>I create and array and taking input from the user and using in function inside my main. I show you sample basic code (not my code) because of you can understand my question clearly.</p>
<pre><code>dynamic_array = []
hexdec = input("Enter the hex number to binary "); 
strArray = [hexdec[idx:idx+2]  for idx in range(len(hexdec)) if idx%2 == 0]
dynamic_array = strArray

def FirstPointer(element):
   print(int(element,16))

FirstPointer(dynamic_array[0])
</code></pre>
<p>Like I said you this is a basic code.However, my code is more longer and complicated, that's why I want to carry the function to the <code>"module1"</code> and call in the main.</p>
<p>Is there any way to do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this in the file you want to import (module1.py):</p>
<pre><code>def ConvertHex(hexdec):
    return [hexdec[idx:idx+2]  for idx in range(len(hexdec)) if idx%2 == 0]

def FirstPointer(element):
    print(int(element, 16))
</code></pre>
<p>In your main file (TestForPython.py), you can utilize these functions like this:</p>
<pre><code>import module1

hexdec = input("Enter the hex number to binary ")

dynamic_array = module1.ConvertHex(hexdec)

module1.FirstPointer(dynamic_array[0])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you are working with the same directory to achieve what you want, you only need to import module1 and use it's methods in your main. </p>
<p>If you're working with different directory then it is called package.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You have lists, not arrays.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">First off all thank you for answer  @AndrasDeak, but it doesn't matter, please input <code>01</code> and you can see the number.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which functionality do you want to use in your other script? Just your <code>FirstPointer</code> function or also the hex conversion?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you @DocDriven for answer, actually, I can't separate, because of If I separate it, main function doesn't understand " where is the strArray" that2s why, I want to call everthin just with <code>FirstPointer(dynamic_array[0])</code> and taking the input in main</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you @DocDriven for your answer but, can I create  <code>dynamic_array = []</code> in the <code>module1.py</code>and use in  <code>TestForPython.py</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because of I want to use  <code>dynamic_array[i]</code> in the <code>module1.py</code> because of for loob and It doesn't recognize.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Asell: you can, just declare your variables as normal and use them with the new namespace, e.g. <code>module1.dynamic_array</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much @DocDriven</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for answer @DarioCruzMinoza I read that documentation before. Howeever when I carry the array to the module1, it doesn't understand, where is the <code>dynamic array[]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">did you use a class base module?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much</span>
