<p>I am calling shell script from my pyhton program and the shell script is having INFO &amp; DEBUG logs as part the output.
When i run the shell script from python program, i can see only standard output, but not the INFO &amp; DEBUG logs which are output of shell script.</p>
<p><strong>My Code:</strong></p>
<pre><code>   process = subprocess.Popen(['bash','/myshell_script.sh',env, params],stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)

   while (True):
     retcode = process.poll()  # returns None while subprocess is running
     line = process.stdout.readline()
     **print(line)**
     if (retcode is not None):
        break
</code></pre>
<p>here when i print the shell script output, i can see only partial output and cannot see the output like '18/10/20 11:24:55 INFO test test' (Which is shell script output)</p>
<p>Could someone help me to provide some info how can i get all the shell script output.</p>

<p>It looks like your script is sending <code>INFO</code> and <code>DEBUG</code> logs to <code>stderr</code>. You can try just to remove <code>stderr=subprocess.PIPE</code>, to see if the output appears in terminal.</p>
<p>If you really need the <code>subprocess.PIPE</code> for <code>stderr</code>, say you want to capture the <code>stderr</code> output from Python, you will need to call <code>process.communicate()</code> see more info <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Popen.communicate</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much for your reply @beezz. You are correct, i removed stderr and can see the output in the terminal. I modified my script to read from <b>'stderr'</b> intead of <b>'stdout'</b>. Now its working fine.</span>
