<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I am trying to do something simple yet hard to think out now.</p>
<p>So basically I have random number generator where it sometimes is:</p>
<pre><code>12
1234
23
2345
</code></pre>
<p>etc etc..</p>
<p>and basically what I want to do is that whenever there is more than 2 characters. Add a space and add a '-' between it meaning a output off:</p>
<pre><code>12
12 3-4
23
23 4-5
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to do a split but it just remove the last two characters</p>
<p>I would appreciate all kind of help!</p>
<p>Soulution:</p>
<pre><code>numbers = ['12', '1234', '23', '2345']

for number in numbers:
    number = str(number) # convert each to string just in case
    if len(number) &gt; 2:
       number = number[:2] + ' ' + number[2] + '-' + number[3:]
    print(number)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>numbers = ['12', '1234', '23', '2345']

for number in numbers:
    number = str(number) # convert each to string just in case
    if len(number) &gt; 2:
       number = number[:2] + ' ' + number[2] + '-' + number[3:]
    print(number)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>map</code> to change to <code>str</code> then use formatted print with list comprehension</p>
<pre><code>lst = [12, 1234, 23, 2345]
lst = map(str, lst)
res = [f'{i[:2]} {i[2]}-{i[3]}' if len(i) &gt; 2 else i for i in lst]
# ['12', '12 3-4', '23', '23 4-5']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Creating new_list</p>
<pre><code>numbers=list(map(str,numbers)) # to convert int to str
new_list=[i[:2] + ' ' + i[2] + '-' + i[3:] if len(i)&gt;2 else i for i in numbers]
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">What if the random number is 3 or 5 digits? What is the output? You're better off reading this: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You forgot to add what you tried and how it failed, also include your attempted code in the question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have created so it will always contain maximum of 4 characters only :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh when I just wanted to add someone gave n answer which I think would solve my issue! Thanks! :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! This solved my issue and I appreciate it alot! :)</span>
