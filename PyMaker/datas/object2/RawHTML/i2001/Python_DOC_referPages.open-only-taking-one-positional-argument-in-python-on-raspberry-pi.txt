<p>I'm having trouble with the <a href="https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/reading-and-writing-files-in-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Open() function</a> in python. It's only taking one positional argument in some cases, and other times it's fine.</p>
<p>In one file, this works perfectly, but in another, an error code pops up saying open only takes one argument. </p>
<p><code>w = open("file.txt", "w")</code></p>
<p><code>TypeError: open() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given</code></p>
<p>The file that works is on my windows machine, but it doesn't work every time. It doesn't seem to work at all on my Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Is this an issue with my interpreter? If so, can anyone suggest what I can do, or if there's another way to read and write to text files?</p>

<p>i think it's better explained in the python docs. You can access the info on open function through the link </p>

<span class="comment-copy">can you be more specific, what do you mean doesn't work, what error code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It can only mean that in the problematic script, <code>open</code> refers to something different than that of standard library. There should be somewhere in that script that says <code>open = ...</code>, or maybe a <code>from module import *</code> that messes the global namespace.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexisDrakopoulos The error code I get is "TypeError: open() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rightleg I've found about importing os, and using open completely differently, and it seems to work. Thank you for your suggestion.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for this! I had a look at it and it explained open.os, which does work for me. I'm still getting used to the syntax around it, but it works!</span>
