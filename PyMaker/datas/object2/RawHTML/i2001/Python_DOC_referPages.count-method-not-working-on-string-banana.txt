<p>I was coding in python to find the number of times a single sub string comes in a given string
I used the predefined method of Python3 ie .count()</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/y08a5.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">1</a>The thing is here when I am trying to count the number of time 'B' or 'A' or'NA' occurs it gives me the perfect result but when I am counting number of 'ANA' present it should give me 2 but gives the output as 1</p>
<pre><code>s="BANANA"
print("B = ",s.count('B'))
print("NA = ",s.count('NA'))
print("NAN = ",s.count('NAN'))
#Here the mistake occurs
print("ANA = ",s.count('ANA'))
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.count</code></a> counts <em>non-overlapping</em> occurences. The first "ANA" shares the "A" with the second "ANA", so the output is 1 instead of 2.</p>
<p>If you want to count overlapping occurences, see the answers to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2970520/string-count-with-overlapping-occurrences">this question</a>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>string.count(sub[, start[, end])</code> function counts the non-overlapping substrings. That's why you get only <code>1</code> as a result.</p>
<p>This is the documentation of this function: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>str.count(sub[, start[, end]])</code> </p>
<p>Return the number of non-overlapping
  occurrences of substring sub in the range <code>[start, end]</code>. Optional
  arguments <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are interpreted as in slice notation.</p>
