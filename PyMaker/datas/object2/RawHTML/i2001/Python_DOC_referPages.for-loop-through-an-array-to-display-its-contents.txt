<p>The program calculates the multiplication table from 0 to 12 for the number the user has entered.
I am trying to display the contents of the array with the results in it by for looping through it. However, it only displays the tables from 0 to 11, but not the 12th one, even if the 12th data is there.</p>
<p>Here is what I came up with:</p>
<pre><code>def multiplicationTable():
 nb = int(input("Please enter a number between 1 and 12 : \n"))

 table = array('i')
 for i in range(0,12):
     table.append(i * nb)

 for i in range(len(table)):
     print(str(nb) + "x" + str(i) + " = " + str(table[i]))
</code></pre>
<p>The output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>4x0 = 0
4x1 = 4
4x2 = 8
4x3 = 12
4x4 = 16
4x5 = 20
4x6 = 24
4x7 = 28
4x8 = 32
4x9 = 36
4x10 = 40
4x11 = 44
</code></pre>
<p>What could be causing that ? Coming from VB and C# so I may be mistaking the i as an index, while it is a value from the array, but I really don't see how I could be fixing this. 
Thank you !</p>

<p>The <code>range()</code> function is non-inclusive of the upper bound. So when you're saying <code>range(0,12)</code>, you're only going to get [0,11]. If you want [0,12], you have to do <code>range(0,13)</code>. Note that <code>range(0,13)</code> is equivalent to <code>range(13)</code> because the default lower-bound is 0.<br/>
See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>range(0,12)</code> goes from <code>0</code> to <code>11</code>. So that is why the <code>i</code> value never reaches 12. If you want for loop to go from <code>0</code> to <code>12</code> just make the for loop use <code>range(0, 13)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should modify your range to <code>range(1,13)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you have <code>array</code> in your code? I don't think python has that unless its self declared function.</span>
