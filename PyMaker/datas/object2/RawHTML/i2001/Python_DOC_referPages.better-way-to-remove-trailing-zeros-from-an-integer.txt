<p>I'm an inexperienced programmer. I'm trying to remove trailing zeros from a whole number, an integer, for a project I've set myself in python.</p>
<p>I have managed to do this but there must be a better way than the monstrosity I have concocted!</p>
<pre><code>def removeZeros(number):
    return int(str(int(str(number)[::-1]))[::-1])
</code></pre>
<p>Essentially I'm turning the integer into a string, reversing the string, turning it back into an integer---which removes the now leading zeros, turning it back into a string and reversing it; and finally turning it back into an integer to return it.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rstrip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.rstrip()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>def remove_zeros(number):
    return int(str(number).rstrip('0'))
</code></pre>
<p>You could also do it without converting the number to a string, which should be slightly faster:</p>
<pre><code>def remove_zeros(number):
    while number % 10 == 0:
        number //= 10
    return number
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What about <code>int(str(number).strip("0"))</code>?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">are you sure that you want to remove trailing zero's from <code>integer</code>? not float?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@guidot thats the one, thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you explain what is happening in your second example?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sylph While the last digit of the number is <code>0</code> (checked with the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/4432208/244297"><code>%</code></a> operator) we discard it by dividing the number by 10.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks I just worked it out. I keep forgetting you can do <code>x //= 10</code> instead of <code>x = x / 10</code>. Need to do more studying! Very elegant solution by the way and perfect for what I need, thanks.</span>
