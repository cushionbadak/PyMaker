<p>I want to make </p>
<pre><code>output=['A','B','C'] 
</code></pre>
<p>into</p>
<pre><code>output=[A,B,C]
</code></pre>
<p>what function can i use to remove the single quotes?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your list <code>list=['A','B','C']</code> means your list has 3 string values <code>'A'</code>, <code>'B'</code> and <code>'C'</code></p>
<p>if you are writing <code>list=[A, b, C]</code> that means your list has 3 variables <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code></p>
<p>so if you define <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> you can do that like,</p>
<pre><code>A = 1
B = 2
C = 3

list = [A, B, C] 
</code></pre>
<p>I would also strongly recommend you to go through <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#using-python-as-a-calculator" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">What are you trying to archive? The quotes shows that that variable is a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You will need to have previously defined <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>, as <i>without</i> quotes, they are variables, and will get <code>NameError</code>s like: <code>NameError: name 'A' is not defined</code>, etc. Otherwise, with quotes they are recognized as type "string"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, thanks for the reply! ['Á','B','C'] is my output. What can I do to change the form into [A,B,C] as my output ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>'['+','.join(output)+']'</code> makes a string that looks like what you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there any examples?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Nothing you can do actually, <code>'A'</code> means is a string and <code>1</code> means its a number, this is how python prints the number and string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you have <code>'1'</code> that means its a string and not a number</span>
