<p>I want to invalidate the "assert" in my Python codes when I run it as a release edition. Consider that a lot of "assert" may be used in my files in the developing procedure, but I want to skip the compiling of "assert" to enhance the efficiency. Is there some simple method like a pre_define of "NDEBUG" in c++ ?</p>

<p>Use command line option <code>-O</code>. As described in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the current implementation, the built-in variable <code>__debug__</code> is <code>True</code>
  under normal circumstances, False when optimization is requested
  (command line option <code>-O</code>). The current code generator emits no code for
  an assert statement when optimization is requested at compile time.</p>
