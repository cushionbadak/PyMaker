<p>This question has already been discussed, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39910730/python3-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command-operable-program">here</a> for example. So:</p>
<p>First: Did you verify that the path was added to environment variables?</p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for more details on adding the path to environment variables (<strong>Section 3.3. Configuring Python</strong>).</p>
<p>Secondly:
There is a "<strong>Python launcher</strong>" for Windows. It's an utility which aids in locating and executing of different Python versions. It allows scripts (or the command-line) to indicate a preference for a specific Python version, and will locate and execute that version.</p>
<p>Unlike the PATH variable, the launcher will correctly select the most appropriate version of Python. It will prefer per-user installations over system-wide ones, and orders by language version rather than using the most recently installed version.</p>
<p>This launcher is simply <strong>py</strong>.</p>
<p>To launch your script or virtual environment in command line simply do this:</p>
<p><strong>py your_script.py</strong> or <strong>py -m venv ENV_DIR</strong></p>
<p>If you have multiple versions of Python installed (2.x, 3.x), just specify the version you want to run like this:</p>
<p><strong>py -2.7 your_script.py</strong> or <strong>py -3.6 your_script.py</strong> </p>
<p>If you want the <strong>latest</strong> version of Python 2.x or python 3.x you have installed, try the command: </p>
<p><strong>py -2 your_script.py</strong> or <strong>py -3 your_script.py</strong></p>
