<p>I'm in the middle of a task and am struggling a little. I may be being silly but please, could someone help? I'd like help with two tasks, 1 and 2 please.</p>
<p>Here's the task:</p>
<p>Text Validation - 
For each of the following tasks use the following formatting:</p>
<p>An invalid entry should print out the message 'Invalid code'.</p>
<p>A valid entry should print out the message 'Valid code'.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Input a 'product code' that meets the following criteria:
It only contains numbers 1-9.</p></li>
<li><p>Input a 'product code' that meets the following criteria:
It only contains letters.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regex</a></p>
<p>For checking the number</p>
<pre><code>import re
if re.match("^[\w_-]*$ ", my_text):
    print("Valid code")
</code></pre>
<p>For checking the letters</p>
<pre><code>if re.match("^[\d_-]*$ ", my_text):
    print("Valid code")
</code></pre>
<p>For above both conditions</p>
<pre><code>if re.match("^[\w\d_-]*$", my_text):
    print("Valid code")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to SO. Please provide a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example. <b>Show us the code for your latest attempt</b> and where you got stuck. and explain why the result is not what you expected.  Edit your question to include the code, please don't add it in a comment, as it will probably be unreadable. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">stackoverflow.com/help/mcve</a>   It is better to show what is actually happening, rather than describing what you expect to happen.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">As mentioned, you will get more help if you attempt some code and include it with your question. Check out <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string methods</a> and you will find what you need in order to validate your input. Shouldn't take too much googling to figure out how to get the input and print your messages once you have the validation sorted out.</span>
