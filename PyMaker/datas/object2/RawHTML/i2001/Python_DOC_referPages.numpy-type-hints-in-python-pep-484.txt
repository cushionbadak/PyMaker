<p>I would like to add type hints to a method that takes a numpy array as an input, and returns a string. This numpy array contains floats so I tried:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
def foo(array: np.ndarray[np.float64]) -&gt; str:
</code></pre>
<p>But it will not work due to a <code>TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable</code>.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy-stubs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> but could not follow the discussions!</p>
<p>I thank you in advance!</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/ramonhagenaars/nptyping" rel="nofollow noreferrer">nptyping</a>. It offers type hints for numpy arrays.</p>
<p>In your case, you would end up with:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import numpy as np
from nptyping import Array

def foo(array: Array[np.float64]) -&gt; str:
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>You can check your instances as well:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>arr = np.array([[1.0, 2.0],
                [3.0, 4.0],
                [5.0, 6.0]])
isinstance(arr, Array[np.float64, 3, 2])  # True
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It looks like that link is an experimental package that is still in development. Have you looked at the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">typing</a> library?</span>
