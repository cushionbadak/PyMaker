<p>I'm trying to random some strings in a variable,</p>
<pre><code>myTest = random.choice(["test1","test2","test3"])
print(myTest)
print(myTets)
print(myTest)
</code></pre>
<p>And when I'm running my script all of them are the same every time,</p>
<pre><code>test1
test1
test1
</code></pre>
<p>I like to random my variable every time I'm calling it, like,</p>
<pre><code>test1
test3
test2
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is basically the same as</p>
<pre><code>x = 42
print(x)
print(x)
print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>A variables value only changes when you assign it:</p>
<pre><code>x = 42
print(x)
x = 45
print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want a new random value, you need to call the function again:</p>
<pre><code>l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
x = random.choice(l)
print(x)
x = random.choice(l)
print(x)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try with this...</p>
<pre><code>print(random.choice("test1","test2","test3"))
print(random.choice("test1","test2","test3"))
print(random.choice("test1","test2","test3"))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have to call the command each time:</p>
<pre><code>myTest = random.choice(["test1","test2","test3"])
print(myTest)
myTest = random.choice(["test1","test2","test3"])
print(myTest)
myTest = random.choice(["test1","test2","test3"])
print(myTest)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First you have to import your random variable. Then you should put your test1, test2 and test3 in one string. then you can get the result you are looking for like this:</p>
<pre><code>import random
myTest = random.choice(["test1, test2, test3"])
print(myTest)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Please visit <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random.sample docs</a>. In your case that can look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import random
my_tests = ['test1','test2','test3']
for choice in random.sample(my_tests, 3):
    print(choice)
</code></pre>
<p>Other option is to do that in place, in other words - by changing <code>my_tests</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import random
my_tests = ['test1','test2','test3']
print(my_tests, '\n\n')
for i in range(10):
    random.shuffle(my_tests)
    print(my_tests)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to store the results to be used somewhere instead of just printing, you should just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a>, the values will be stored directly in a new list.</p>
<p>Interpreter:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import random
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; choices = ["test1","test2","test3"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; selected = [random.choice(choices) for _ in range(3)] # iterates 3 times, appending value of "random.choice(choices)" to the end of the list
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(selected)
['test1', 'test2', 'test2']
</code></pre>
<p>By the way, "_" is just "I don't care" variable used to store values that you don't need, if you needed the number, you'd use name it a proper variable like "i" and use it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>myTets</code> is hopefully typo? Also, <code>random.choice</code> is not variadic, it needs exactly one parameter (that should be a list): <code>random.choice(["test1","test2","test3"])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">For that you have to call random each time you want random string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Related: <a href="//stackoverflow.com/q/49587299">Updating a parameter's value doesn't update the result of the function?</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are repeatedly printing the value of a variable without changing it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">let me make something clear I have a var.py in that I'm saving my variables and in another python file im trying to read var.myTest</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArmanTrb I don't understand what that has to do with your quesiton.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArmanTrb If you cannot adapt my answer directly to your problem, you should edit your question to show a more complex example that illustrates what you have done and explain in more detail what you are trying to do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArmanTrb If you want the value of <code>var.myTest</code> to change, you have to assign it different values. If you assign it only once, then it never changes. Having global variables in <code>var.py</code> seems like the incorrect solution to your real problem. I suggest you learn about functions and how to pass arguments to them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArmanTrb It doesn't matter if you have thousand variables like this. It also doesn't matter what you're doing with those variables. You have to call <code>random.choice</code> every time you want to pick a random element. There's no way around that. You can, however, write a function like <code>def random_greeting(): return random.choice(['Hi', 'Greetings', 'Welcome'])</code> and then simply call that function whenever you need a random greeting: <code>print(random_greeting())</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That won't repeat a value, though, so it's not the same as calling <code>choice</code> in the loop. Of course, the OP might actually want that. And if they do, another option is to call <code>shuffle</code> on the list, if you don't mind shuffling the original list.</span>
