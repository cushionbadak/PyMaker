<p>Quick question, what is the difference between</p>
<pre><code>import file
import .file
</code></pre>
<p>Can someone explain the difference between them? Can someone explain all kinds of importing to me?</p>
</div>

<pre><code>import .file
</code></pre>
<p>It's the new syntax for explicit relative imports. It means import from the current package. This is the current namespace or package directory.</p>
<p>You can use more than one dot, referring not to the current package but its parent(s). This should only be used within packages, in the main module.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are two ways to use functions of other modules.</p>
<p>First is importing the whole Module.</p>
<pre><code>import math      #this will import math module
print(math.sqrt(4))  #Using function of math module
</code></pre>
<p>Second Method is by importing the function not module</p>
<pre><code>from math import sqrt     #this will import sqrt function not full module
print(sqrt(4))     #Using function of math module
</code></pre>
<p>Note some more suggestions
1. you can also import module and function by using <strong>as</strong> and import it under n alias name,
Example 
import math as ilovemaths  #importing under alias name
print(ilovemaths.sqrt(4))    #using the function of module.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You can also * to import functions but then the problem will be of conflicting names. So be specific and choose the best method to import.</li>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This</a> will explain all kinds of importing to you. Do you have specific questions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@lmiguelvargasf: No, <code>import .file</code> is a syntax error, and even with the corrected syntax, your description is wrong. Relative imports are about packages, not directories.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112, you are right. I got confuse because <code>from .file import something</code> works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>import .file</code> is a syntax error. Try it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, it isn't as it used in the cases I mentioned above. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7279810/what-does-a-in-an-import-statement-in-python-mean" title="what does a in an import statement in python mean">stackoverflow.com/questions/7279810/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you look closely, you'll find that not a single post on that page tries to use <code>import .file</code> syntax. It's all <code>from</code> imports.</span>
