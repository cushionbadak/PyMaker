<p>I have a very simple question but I don't understand why it doesn't work.
I would like to set the path to <code>.json file</code> like this :</p>
<pre><code>with open(settings.BASE_DIR + '../../package.json') as package_json_file:
</code></pre>
<p>But i'm getting this issue :</p>
<pre><code>FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/val/Bureau/Projets/APP/app/src../../package.json'
</code></pre>
<p>How I can define the path from <code>BASE_DIR</code> and come back to .json file ?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can see the issue in the error message: <code>src../../package.json</code> - there is a forward slash missing in <code>src..</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of concatenating strings, use <code>os.path.join</code> so that you don't have to worry about missing/duplicate forward slashes.</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, '../../package.json')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First of all the problem in your code should be obvious: You are missing backslash between the <code>BASE_DIR</code> and the hard coded path you are adding. This this</p>
<p><code>with open(settings.BASE_DIR + '/../../package.json') as package_json_file:</code></p>
<p>should work (if the package is there of course).</p>
<p>However, to avoid such inconsistencies, it is better to explicitly use <code>os.path.join</code> to properly create paths, i.e you can use something like </p>
<p><code>with open(os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, '..', '..', 'package.json')) as package_json_file:</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">You haven't said what <code>BASE_DIR</code> or your project layout is, but using <code>'..'</code> to go up a directory should work. Perhaps you have too many or too few <code>..</code>s. You can debug by checking <code>os.path.abspath(os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, '../../package.json')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes now it works I apologize :/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right I paste the bad part. But, if I wrote your code, it searches <code>package.json</code> in <code>/home/val/Bureau/Projets/OMCL/omcl/src</code>. package.json is placed in <code>/home/val/Bureau/Projets/OMCL/</code> that's why I would like to come back in my path</span>
