<p>I have an array a = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]].
How could I reduce it to b = [1,2,3]?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If the inner array is always two of the same values.</p>
<pre><code>a = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
b = [i for i,j in a]
</code></pre>
<p>This produces:</p>
<pre><code>b = [1,2,3]   
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Are the values in the inner lists always identical? i.e. <code>[x, x]</code>? If yes, why do you even have a nested list like that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How exactly do you want it to be reduced? Say you had a list <code>a = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]</code>, or perhaps <code>[[1, 2], [3], [5, 4]]</code>. Would you want out of these <code>[1, 3, 5]</code>, or something else?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">...if so, then the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a> <code>[inner_list[0] for inner_list in a]</code> will do the trick, but I don't know if that is indeed what you want.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the elements are always the same</span>
<span class="comment-copy">a = [a[i][0] for i in range(len(a))]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And if the inner lists can be of different lengths (but can't be empty):   <code>[head for head, *tail in a]</code>. This is especially useful for lists of generic iterables. If the elements are indexable, just <code>[sub[0] for sub in a]</code> should do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I like that @timgeb</span>
