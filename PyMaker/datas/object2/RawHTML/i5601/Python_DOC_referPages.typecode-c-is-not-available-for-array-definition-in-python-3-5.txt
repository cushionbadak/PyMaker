<p>I am using python 3.5. I am trying to define an array with set of characters. I tried the below.</p>
<pre><code>import array
my_char_array = array.array('c', ['g','e','e','k'])
</code></pre>
<p>When I run, I get the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ValueError: bad typecode (must be b, B, u, h, H, i, I, l, L, q, Q, f
  or d)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't 'c' a valid typecode for characters? Please enlighten me.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>According to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>, <code>'c'</code> is not anymore available in python 3.5. It was available in python 2.6 as documented <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. You may use signed or unsigned types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'b'</code>: signed char</li>
<li><code>'B'</code>: unsigned char</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <code>'b'</code>:</p>
<p><code>m = array.array('b',  [ord('g'), ord('e'), ord('e'), ord('k')])</code></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrays represent basic values and behave very much like lists, except
  the type of objects stored in them is constrained. The type is specified
  at object creation time by using a type code, which is a single character.
  The following type codes are defined:</p>
<pre><code> Type code   C Type             Minimum size in bytes 
  'b'         signed integer     1 
  'B'         unsigned integer   1 
  'u'         Unicode character  2 (see note) 
  'h'         signed integer     2 
  'H'         unsigned integer   2 
  'i'         signed integer     2 
  'I'         unsigned integer   2 
  'l'         signed integer     4 
  'L'         unsigned integer   4 
  'q'         signed integer     8 (see note) 
  'Q'         unsigned integer   8 (see note) 
  'f'         floating point     4 
  'd'         floating point     8

<p>It's not valid in Python 3, but you can use <code>'b'</code> (signed character) or <code>'B'</code> (unsigned character). You have to pass numbers instead of strings though. You can convert characters to numerical values using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ord()</code></a>. There is a <code>'u'</code> code for unicode characters, but it is deprecated.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html</a></p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>All strings in Python 3 are unicode. That means that unlike in C, a single character does not fit into one byte. If you want an array of single bytes, you can use type code <code>'b'</code> or <code>'B'</code>, but you can't pass characters in to initialise the array (since characters don't fit into bytes).</p>
<p>It's easy enough to convert characters to integers on the fly like this:</p>
<pre><code>array.array('b', map(ord, 'Some characters'))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">'b' is an integer. You should convert your char to an integer using ord('char').</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I tried with 'b'. I am getting the following error:  my_char_array = array.array('b', ['g','e','e','k']) TypeError: an integer is required (got type str)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">See edited answer. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. Do you have any idea why python made this change. Isn't it just easier to use 'c'? What is the need to read  as 'b' with string conversion.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I do not know. Here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#text-vs-data-instead-of-unicode-vs-8-bit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/â€¦</a> there is a possible explanation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The 'u' type works. I don't understand what 'b' means and the need to pass as number and convert into characters :(..  I need to do some research. I am new to OOP.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Harish I have added some explanation to my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. This helps :)</span>
