<p>Python has a covenient <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/linecache.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>linecache</code></a> library to deal with your situation:</p>
<pre><code>import linecache

def option_a():
    line_number = int(input("Enter a line number: "))
    line = linecache.getline("firesideFixtures.txt", line_number)

<p>The argument to readlines() doesn't specify which line to read from the file.  Try something like this instead:</p>
<pre><code>def option_a():
    fixchoice = int(input("Enter: "))

    with open("firesideFixtures.txt", "r") as file:
        for i, line in enumerate(file, 1):
            if i == fixchoice:

<span class="comment-copy">can you show us Expected and Actual output of your code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Specifically, what's in the file, what numbers are you inputting, and what do you expect the corresponding results to be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your argument to <code>readlines</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html?highlight=readlines#codecs.StreamReader.readlines" rel="nofollow noreferrer">does not do</a> what you seem to think.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the meaning of <code>fixchoice</code>? Is it the number of lines? Is it the line number?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to read up a bit on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.readlines" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>readlines()</code></a>: "no more lines will be read <b>if the total size (in bytes/characters)</b> of all lines so far exceeds hint."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you, it is working now</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Each time that function is called, it leaves a file handle open. I suggest you use <code>file.close()</code> after the loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">.. or use the more transparent <code>with</code> syntax.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>enumerate</code> by default will start with zero. Line numbers usually start with one. When the user types <b>1</b>, he or she wants line 1, not line 2. You can fix it with <code>enumerate(file, 1)</code> to start with one instead of zero.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good inputs all of you, I've updated my example to include that.  I didn't intend to make an entire workable example, only fix the issue in the question itself, but it might be best I guess.</span>
