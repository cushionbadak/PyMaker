<p>I am trying to understand TenserFlow image classification. Got following <a href="https://github.com/shivakrishna9/tensorflow-retrain" rel="nofollow noreferrer">code</a> from GitHub, starts from 298 line in "retrain.py" script.</p>
<pre><code>dest_directory = FLAGS.model_dir
if not os.path.exists(dest_directory):
os.makedirs(dest_directory)
</code></pre>
<p>What does <code>"FLAGS.model_dir"</code> mean and where is this directory located?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>FLAGS</code> holds parsed command line arguments. This script uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>argparse</code></a> library, but the style is inherited from <a class="post-tag" href="/questions/tagged/gflags" rel="tag" title="show questions tagged 'gflags'">gflags</a> library, originally developed internally at Google in C++, then open sources and ported to different languages.</p>
<p>What <code>FLAGS.model_dir</code> means is easy to see from the parser definitions:</p>
<pre><code>parser.add_argument(
      '--model_dir',
      type=str,
      default='/tmp/imagenet',
      help="""\
      Path to classify_image_graph_def.pb,
      imagenet_synset_to_human_label_map.txt, and
      imagenet_2012_challenge_label_map_proto.pbtxt.\
      """
  )
</code></pre>
<p>So, its location is specified by the user when she runs the script. If nothing it specified, this path is used: <code>'/tmp/imagenet'</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Script doesn't ask any directory where to put downloaded data set. It just start downloading. Problem is that I had interrupted the download now script try to access that downloaded file that is missing or not completely downloaded, causing run time error and script now doesn't run. <code>/tmp/imagenet</code> where is this directory, So I can delete it and data can be re-downloaded.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If I want to manually code different directory path, how it can be done?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, it doesn't ask. It relies on the right arguments. If you run <code>train.sh</code>, it uses <code>--model_dir=inception</code>, so the model is in the nearby <code>inception</code> dir</span>
