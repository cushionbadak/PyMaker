<p>For some reason this code seems to enter an infinite loop and I have no clue why</p>
<pre><code>import timeit

t = timeit.Timer(stmt="for num in num_list: print(num)",
                 setup="num_list = [digit for digit in range(1, 101)]")

print(t.timeit())
</code></pre>
<p>I have python version 3.6.2 installed via Anaconda.</p>
<p>I've tried running it in the Spyder IDE and in command prompt, both have the same results.</p>
<p>If I change the setup to be generator instead of list comprehension everything works fine, the same can be said about running identical code out of timeit.</p>
<p>I've even tried restarting my computer because ya know, I have to try turning it off and on again, it works for most things.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It’s not an infinite loop – just a long one. <code>setup</code> only runs once, so when you use a generator expression, it gets consumed after the first run of <code>stmt</code> and nothing further is printed. When you use a list comprehension, each list element is printed every run of <code>stmt</code>, resulting in 100 × 1000000 calls to <code>print</code>. (1 million is the default number of iterations for <code>Timer.timeit()</code>.)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried it without timeit?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html</a> - default interations is 1,000,000.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SuperStew I confirmed it works outside of timeit already in my original post</span>
