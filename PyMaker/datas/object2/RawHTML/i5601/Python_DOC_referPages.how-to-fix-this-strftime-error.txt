<p>I would like to only print <code>'%d/%m/%Y, %H:%M'</code>, but
when I say:</p>
<pre><code>print(loan_due.strftime('%d/%m/%Y, %H:%M'))
</code></pre>
<p>I'm getting an error saying <code>AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'strftime'</code>.</p>
<p>I tried many ways but it's still not working for me. <code>loan_due</code> I have in my json file and this how it looks: </p>
<pre><code>{"customer": [{"loan_due": "22/12/2017, 19:02:39:4536"}]}
</code></pre>

<p>You can't convert it to a string, because it's actually already a string. If you want to change the way in which the string is formatted, try converting it to a datetime object first.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is using datetime.strptime. You can review the documentation for it here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior</a></p>
<p>You can then use your datetime.strftime to convert this to whatever format you see fit.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>my_dict['customer'][0]['loan_due']</code> is just a string. You need it to be a <code>datetime</code> object to be able to call <code>stftime</code> on it. Look into <code>strptime</code> to convert a string to a datetime. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You would also need to <code>import datetime</code> for that to work. You haven't provided a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> of what you're actually trying to do.</span>
