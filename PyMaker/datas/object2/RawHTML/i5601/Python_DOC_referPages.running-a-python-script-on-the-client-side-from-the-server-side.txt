<p>I have designed a website using Flask (Python 2.7). I have sent a Python script (<code>c.py</code>) to the client using the <code>send_file()</code> function.</p>
<p>Now I want to run <code>c.py</code> on the client system from the server side maybe by using my website itself or my system. Is there a possible way to do that?</p>
<p>Note: Client and server are on the same network.</p>
<p>Is it possible to write a python script which can run another python script on another system?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">exec</a>("input the content of your py file"), which supports dynamic execution of Python code.</p>
<p>A demo here: Suppose that you could run Python script on client side</p>
<p>=== Server Side ===</p>
<pre><code>from flask import Flask, send_file
import StringIO

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    sio = StringIO.StringIO()
    sio.write('print("hello world")')
    sio.seek(0)
    return send_file(sio, attachment_filename="c.py")

app.run(debug=True)
</code></pre>
<p>=== Client Side ===</p>
<pre><code>import requests

code = requests.get('http://localhost:5000').text
exec(code)  # &lt;-----
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">maybe you should better design your program in such way: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call</a> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are couple ways to do it. One easy way is through SSH (if running on Linux/Mac platform)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@py_dude thanks will look into it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My server operates on windows. So I need help on that. @Vinny 16</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How and where to use this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When your client system receive c.py, pass the content of c.py into <code>exec</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added a demo. But I do not know how your client looks like, so suppose that you could run Python script on client side.</span>
