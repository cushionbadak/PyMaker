<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I need to translate this regular expression to the python language:</p>
<pre><code>(([[:alpha:]]|\.)*/PERSON([[:space:]]|$))+
</code></pre>
<p>I have a .txt file that contains names of people with the /PERSON tag and other words that do not have tags.</p>
<pre><code>Leo/PERSON Messi/PERSON hello
</code></pre>
<p>Once you make the equivalent program in python to the regular expression above, the output must be this (all names with the label /PERSON, the other words are not):</p>
<pre><code>Leo/PERSON Messi/PERSON
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the Regex pattern:</p>
<pre><code>(?:[A-Za-z.]*/PERSON\s*)+
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><code>[A-Za-z.]*</code> matches zero or more of <code>[A-Za-z.]</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>/PERSON\s*</code> matches <code>/PERSON</code> followed by zero or more whitespace</p></li>
<li><p>The above is put in a non-captured group and the group is matched one or more time by the <code>+</code> token.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>In [9]: re.search(r'(?:[A-Za-z.]*/PERSON\s*)+', 'Leo/PERSON Messi/PERSON hello').group()
Out[9]: 'Leo/PERSON Messi/PERSON ' 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you include the code you have in Python in your question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's stopping you from doing the translation? I know this sounds like a trite comment, but your question shows no effort on your part. SO is not intended to be a free coding service where you can just post a request and people will do it for you. We need to you to make an attempt at it. Start by reviewing the Python docs for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re module</a>, which implements Python's regular expression engine. As is shown by other comments and answers on this question, <i>sometimes</i> people will be kind enough to do just that, but you shouldn't expect it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>(?:[a-zA-Z.]*/PERSON(?:\s|$))+</code>? Took me 2 minutes. Check out <a href="https://regex101.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regex101.com</a></span>
