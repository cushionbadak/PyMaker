<p>While learning to use "statistics module" in python 3.6 I am facing the following error: 
NameError: name 'statistics' is not defined
I am just testing statistics basic functions which should return mean, median, mode, stdev, variance.
I am new to Python and I can't find where the error is.</p>
<p>Code: </p>
<pre><code>from statistics import *

example_list = [5,2,5,6,1,2,6,7,2,6,3,5,5]

x = statistics.mean(example_list)
print(x)

y = statistics.median(example_list)
print(y)

z = statistics.mode(example_list)
print(z)

a = statistics.stdev(example_list)
print(a)

b = statistics.variance(example_list)
print(b)
</code></pre>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If I do this in IDLE, all works as expected.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from statistics import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; example_list = [5,2,5,6,1,2,6,7,2,6,3,5,5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = mean(example_list)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
4.230769230769231
</code></pre>
<p>So I don't get the error you report at <code>x = mean(example_list)</code>.</p>
<p>You haven't reported your stack trace (<em>why not?</em>) so it's not possible for me to tell, but I suspect you have named your test program <code>statistics.py</code>, and that is hiding the real <code>statistics</code> module.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>"from" module "import" *</code></a> brings in all the names defined in <code>__all__</code> if that exists and all names except for those starting with an underscore if <code>__all__</code> doesn't exist.</p>
<p>You don't need to qualify the names imported (that is, prefix them with <code>statistics</code>). Just used them directly, <code>median</code>, <code>mode</code>, <code>stdev</code>, <code>variance</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You are absolutely right. Thank you. I still don't understand how naming the script statistics.py will hide all function's module however when I change this to stats.py it all works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>statistics</code> module lives in a file called <code>statistics. py</code>. Having your own module of the same name in the local folder takes precedence.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe it's worth putting in the answer that <code>from something import *</code> is really not a great idea, and a better way to fix this would be to <code>import statistics</code> and keep the rest of the code as it is?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank for you answer. I got the same NameError 'mean' is not defined after removing 'statistics' prefix</span>
