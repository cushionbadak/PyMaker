<p>I am assuming this error is because the <code>csv.py</code> file is somehow still somewhere in the cache? The new file name is <code>newyear1.py</code>. But I do not understand this error, especially that if I try to update <code>nltk</code>, it tells me that it is up to date.</p>

<p>It was rather another newbie moment. The file I was working with was formatted wrong. I solved the issue by creating a new file into a new directory.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The message is about error in " import csv File "/Users/JK/Documents/csv.py" , which is an older file that I am not working out of. the NLTK downloader is not working for some reason.</span>
