<p>I'm trying to create a cartesian product list of all possible combinations between two lists, made from a master list.  But passing the "master_list" into the cartesian product function. </p>
<p>I want the results:</p>
<p>(0, 0)
(0, 1)
(0, 2)
(0, 3)
(0, 4)
(1, 0)
(1, 1)
(1, 2)
(1, 3)
(1, 4)</p>
<pre><code>x = [0,1]
y = [0,1,2,3,4]
</code></pre>
<p>This works (below) in displaying desired results:</p>
<pre><code>mylist = list(itertools.product(x, y))
</code></pre>
<p>However, this doesn't work (below), and this is what I really need.  The "master_list" list might be comprised of multiple lists dynamically.  What am I missing here?:</p>
<pre><code>master_list = [x, y]
mylist = list(itertools.product(master_list))
</code></pre>
<p>The list "master_list" is being created dynamically within the code, so I can't type something like this below.  This example also works to show what I need.</p>
<pre><code>mylist = list(itertools.produuct(master_list[0], master_list[1]))
</code></pre>

<p>You need to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-parameter_list_starargs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">unpack</a> it.</p>
<pre><code>list(itertools.product(*master_list)))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">How does <code>master_list</code> actually looks like? It could just be a problem of "flattening" a <i>list of lists</i>? (converting a list of lists into a list)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What master_list looks like should be above.  It is just a list that contains x list and y list.  Can you see the line that says "master_list = [x, y]"?  Thank you for your help.  I must be missing something obvious here.</span>
