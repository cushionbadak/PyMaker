<p>I have a card game that contains a list of cards in a players hand from top to bottom and I need to check up to what point the cards list break from the order of small to large(from top to bottom). I am not able to use any sort of GUI's.</p>
<p>For example,
cards in players hand:
23
24
12
5-check for the fifth element in the list that is properly sorted
4
3
2
1</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Code commented for explanation reasons, hth:</p>
<pre><code>cardsInHand = [23,24,25,23,27,4]  # all your cards

cardsInOrder = []                 # empty list, to be filled with in order cards
lastCard = None  

for card in cardsInHand:                  # loop all cards in hand
    if not lastCard or lastCard &lt; card:       # if none taken yet or smaller
        cardsInOrder.append(card)                 # append to result
        lastCard = card                           # remember for comparison to next card
    else:                                     # not in order
        break                                     # stop collecting more cards into list 

print(cardsInOrder)               # print all
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[23, 24, 25]
</code></pre>
<p>If you need the <em>unordered</em> part of your hand as well, you can get that by:</p>
<pre><code>unorderedCards = cardsInHand[len(cardsInOrder):] # list-comp based length of ordered cards
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">So show us what you have tried so far</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if hands1[0]&gt;hands1[1]:         solitaireScore=5         if hands1[1]&gt;hands1[2]:             solitaireScore=10</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but the problem is I'm trying to make it like a nested if statement but don't know how to do it. I want to check if the first card is greater than the second card if this is true than proceed. to the other condition etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might consider using dictionary like {"23":4, "24": 3, "12":2, "5": 1} and then if use sorted(your_dict)  - like <code>sorted(yourdict.iteritems(), key=lambda (k,v): (v,k)) </code> - using dictionary would give you O(1) time, vs using list</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@dmitryro But sorting itself is <code>O(nlogn)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also, can you help me solve a problem with writing to a list, every time I exit off the file and add more info it wipes the previous data?</span>
