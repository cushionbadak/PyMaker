<p>Sometimes I need search some thing inside some python library docs that I have installed  and I always use help() built-in function but I would like to know if there are some way to search inside this content or even better, without need to open a python terminal. I really would like to know some clean way to do this (linux based), avoiding pipes or something like this that I already know.  There are some library or external useful to share with us?</p>

<p>In shell:</p>
<pre><code>pydoc modulename | grep the-word
</code></pre>
<p>Example</p>
<pre><code>$ pydoc os | grep chmod
chmod(...)
    chmod(path, mode)
fchmod(...)
    fchmod(fd, mode)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you want a way to search all the docstrings in one go, or just the docstring for a class or method you name?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">At least the same info that I can get using help() inside the interpreter. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, it's interesting. I did not know it, but I can not use if I want to get info about a library installed in my venv, as pymongo for example. Or I can?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure you can. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></span>
