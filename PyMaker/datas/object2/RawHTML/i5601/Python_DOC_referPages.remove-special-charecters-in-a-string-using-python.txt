<p>I have a <code>string = "msdjdgf(^&amp;%*(Aroha Technologies&amp;^$^&amp;*^CHJdjg"</code> with special characters.</p>
<p>what i am trying is to remove all special charecters in the string and then display the word 'Aroha Technologies'</p>
<p>i was able to do with hard coding using <code>lstrip()</code> function but can anyone help me out how can i display string 'Aroha Technologies' in a single line using regular expressions.</p>
<p>edit suggested:-</p>
<p>by using this <code>lstrip()</code> and <code>rstrip()</code> functions i was able to remove characters from the string.</p>
<pre><code>str = "msdjdgf(^&amp;%*(Aroha Technologies&amp;^$^&amp;*^CHJdjg"

str=str.lstrip('msdjdgf(^&amp;%*(')

str=str.rstrip('&amp;^$^&amp;*^CHJdjg')
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>here, A bit more <em>dirty</em> approach</p>
<pre><code>import re # A module in python for String matching/operations  
a = "msdjdgf(^&amp;%*(Aroha Technologies&amp;^$^&amp;*^CHJdjg"
stuff = re.findall('\W(\w+\s\w+)\W', a)
print(stuff[0]) # Aroha Technologies
</code></pre>
<p>hope this helps ;)</p>

<p>You don't provide a lot of information, so this may or may not be close to what you want:</p>
<pre><code>import re
origstr = "msdjdgf(^&amp;%(Aroha Technologies&amp;^$^&amp;^CHJdjg"
match = re.search("[A-Z][a-z]*(?: [A-Z][a-z]*)*", origstr)
if match:
    newstr = match.group()
</code></pre>
<p>(looks for a series of capitalized words with spaces between them)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">here msdjdgf are not special characters. So you cannot do this using lstrip()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@gaur93 by using this hard coded function i was able to remove unwanted charecters str.lstrip('msdjdgf(^&amp;%*(')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sunilBhatraju Please show the proper code you tried to get output</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How are you logically defining what you want to <i>keep</i>  and how are you differentiating this from what you don't want to keep?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know a way to strip off special characters, but that still leaves you with alphanum gibberish.  How do you intend to isolate what you want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its working but can u explain what this line(stuff = re.findall('\W(\w+\s\w+)\W', a)) does?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>findall</code> finds all the occurrences of <code>Aroha Technologies</code> in the string but the constraint is that it must be surrounded by <b><i>non word characters (\W) separated by a white-space (\s)</i></b>, and <code>a</code> is the string, finally we save all the juice in stuff.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is re? can elaborate the answer u provided it will be helpful</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sunilBhatraju, you are asking for an answer using regular expressions. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re</a> is a module in Python used for regular expression operations.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">kk thanks @srig i just checked it but i was unable to display the string after trying the answer u provided</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using <code>str</code> as a variable name overrides the built-in type.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sunilBhatraju, do you mean my answer in the comments?</span>
