<p>I am very new to Python and I am going through the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" book (<a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter6/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter6/</a>). I am working on the Password Locker project and having difficulties with the pyperclip module. I am running Python 3.6.2 on Mac OS X Yosemite. </p>
<p>When I try to run my program through terminal I receive this message:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./pw.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    import sys, pyperclip
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyperclip'
</code></pre>
<p>However, I have already installed pyperclip and receive this message when I try using "pip3 install pyperclip":</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install pyperclip
Requirement already satisfied: pyperclip in     
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages
</code></pre>
<p>and it works fine for me in Shell:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyperclip
&gt;&gt;&gt; pyperclip.copy('hello')
&gt;&gt;&gt; pyperclip.paste()
'hello'
</code></pre>
<p>I believe my program is identical to that in the book aside from the actual passwords:</p>
<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env python3
# pw.py - An insecure password locker program.

PASSWORDS = {'email': '12345',
             'blog' : '54321',
             'luggage': '123456789' }

import sys, pyperclip
if len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:
    print('Usage: python pw.py [account] - copy account password')
    sys.exit()

account = sys.argv[1]   # first command line arg is the account name

if account in PASSWORDS:
    pyperclip.copy(PASSWORDS[account])
    print('Password for ' + account + ' copied to clipboard.')
else:
    print('There is no account named ' + account) 
</code></pre>
<p>I've been trying to find out why this happens, but cannot figure it out. Again, I am very new to Python and any helpful insight would be much appreciated! Thanks!</p>

<p>You mentioned that pyperclip is installed in<br/>
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/lib/python3.6/site-packages</p>
<p>In your script, <code>print(sys.path)</code> and verify that directory is available to your program for imports. If interpreter and library are still mismatched, consider creating an environment using conda or virtualenv.</p>
<p>BTW, please delete the <code>import</code> line, and put two new <code>import</code> lines right after the shebang, so they appear before the PASSWORDS assignment. It's just a flake8 style thing.</p>
<p>Also, consider using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">argparse</a> or <a href="http://click.pocoo.org/5/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">click</a> rather than reading <code>sys.argv[1]</code>. For one thing, you get "--help" for free.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Change the shebang in <code>#! /usr/bin/env python</code> an run it using python2 instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Script works perfectly on my computer, so it's probably a directory issue. What does <code>os.getcwd()</code> return? Try installing another module, like <code>arrow</code>, and see if you can import that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what does <code>which python3</code> and <code>which pip3</code> and <code>head -1 $(which pip3)</code> say</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You said "it works fine for you in Shell".  Are you using some sort of IDE for your development?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems to have been a directory issue. I reinstalled Python and everything seemed to work out. Thanks for your replies!</span>
