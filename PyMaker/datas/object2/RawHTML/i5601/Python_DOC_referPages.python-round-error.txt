<p>What is wrong with the <code>round</code> function in Python 3.6.3? I tested the code below:</p>
<pre><code>a = 0.5
b = 0.5000001
print (round(a),round(b))
</code></pre>
<p>..and get result as</p>
<pre><code>0 1
</code></pre>
<p>So rounding <code>0.5</code> -&gt; <code>0</code> but <code>0.500001</code> -&gt; <code>1</code>. Should both variables get value of <code>1</code>?</p>

<p>It's described in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If ndigits is omitted or is None, it returns the nearest integer to
  its input.</p>
<p>For the built-in types supporting round(), values are rounded to the
  closest multiple of 10 to the power minus ndigits; if two multiples
  are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice (so, for
  example, both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0, and round(1.5) is 2).</p>

<p><b> Both variable will not get value 1.</b>
because the value between range from 0.0000000 to 0.5000000  will round off to 0 ,but <b>when you increase any decimal bit after 0.5 it will round off to 1.</b></p>

<span class="comment-copy">There's nothing wrong with it. Per <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a> Python 3.x rounds half to even by default.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes they should and it does in 2.7 and 3 as well, idk why it's not working right quiet strange , but whatever , i have seen stranger things!</span>
