<p>I need to regularly scrape a site for coupon codes, validate them, and send out notifications. Validation in slow, however, so I don't want that process to bog down the flow of my app. Ideally, the scraper shouldn't have to wait for validation to finish to pump out more results.</p>
<p>I imagine the flow of data looking like this:</p>
<pre><code>SCRAPER --&gt; \_/ &lt;--&gt; VALIDATOR &lt;--&gt; \_/ &lt;--&gt; NOTIFIER
</code></pre>
<p>In-between each stage is a queue containing intermediate results. Is this feasible to implement? Does it even make sense to do? Thanks!</p>
