<p>So at the moment when I want to use a program with argparse, in the terminal I have to do</p>
<pre><code>python scriptname.py --arg 1
</code></pre>
<p>I was wondering if there is any way of making so that all I have to type is:</p>
<pre><code>--arg 1
</code></pre>
<p>It would make using it easier and look neater. Thanks.</p>

<p>What you ask is not possible, because you have to specify which program to run, before you can give it any arguments.</p>
<p>However, if your goal is to reduce the number of keystrokes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you could give your script a short name if you're interested in reducing the number of keystrokes.</p></li>
<li><p>you could add the following line to the start of your script</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
</code></pre>
<p>make it executable, run the following from the command line,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;chmod a+x scriptname
</code></pre>
<p>and then call the script like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;./scriptname --arg 1
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>if you have only 1 argument, you could also omit the <code>--arg</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But there's no way for the system to know which script you want to call based on the argument you pass to it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How would that even theoretically work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tagc well the way i thought would be somehow 'being inside the script' so that when you use an argument it knows to run from that program</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Might also be worth taking a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">cmd</a> module, this makes it easy to write line-based interpreters (e.g. you would start your script, then just type commands to pass to it).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What you could do is execute the script once and the script asks for the arguments using <code>input</code> inside a loop. This way you only have to type <code>python scriptname.py</code> once and you can run it multiple times with different arguments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">alright, thanks a lot</span>
