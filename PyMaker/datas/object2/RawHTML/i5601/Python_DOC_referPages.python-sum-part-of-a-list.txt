<p>Given a list, how can I find sums of part of the list? For example:</p>
<pre><code>a = [2,5,4,6,8]
sum(a) = 25
</code></pre>
<p>I want to find out if a part of the list sums up to a certain number.<br/>
The list part should have a certain length. This is my goal:</p>
<pre><code>ex_list = [2,5,4,6,8]
dif_list = partsum(ex_list, 3)
print(dif_list) ==&gt; [11, 13, 15, 12, 14, 16, 15, 17, 19, 18]
</code></pre>
<p>Each element in 'dif_list' is given by taking 3 numbers out of 'ex_list' and summing them up, i.e. 2+5+4 = 11, 2+5+6 = 13, 2+5+8 = 15, 2+4+6 = 12, etc.<br/>
Also for reference:</p>
<pre><code>ex_list = [2,5,4,6,8]
another_list = partsum(ex_list, 4)
print(another_list) ==&gt; [17, 19, 21, 20, 23]
</code></pre>
<p>Because 2+5+4+6 = 17, 2+5+4+8 = 19, etc.<br/>
Basically, partsum(thing, num) will take 'num' items of 'thing', sum them up, and append it to a new list. All help is appreciated, thanks!</p>

<p>You want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html?highlight=itertools%20combinations#itertools.combinations" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.combinations</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>import itertools

lst = [2,5,4,6,8]
combos = itertools.combinations(lst, 3)
# combos is equivalent to
# [ [2, 5, 4], [2, 5, 6], [2, 5, 8],
#   [2, 4, 6], [2, 4, 8], [2, 6, 8],
#   [5, 4, 6], [5, 4, 8], [5, 6, 8],
#   [4, 6, 8] ]
result = [sum(combo) for combo in combos]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What's the larger context you need this for?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want all combinations with <code>num</code> elements and their sum?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you are trying to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">partitions</a>, using combinations is the least efficient way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are all of the numbers positive?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and if you want to only have distinct sums change the last line into <code>set([sum(combo) for combo in combos])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hansaplast Why not a set comprehension?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AdamSmith Thanks! And will this work if there are less than 3 items in a list 'lst' for combinations(lst,3)? (Or I can find out eventually...)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@adamsmith The program I'm using can't import <code>itertools</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChristopherMarley that's fine, write your own version then. I'm not sure why you wouldn't be able to import it though, it's part of the stdlib LOL!</span>
