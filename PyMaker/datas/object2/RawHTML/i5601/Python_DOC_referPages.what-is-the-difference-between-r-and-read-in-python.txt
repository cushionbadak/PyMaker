<p>I want to open a text file and use  <code>split</code></p>
<p>Here is the code I wrote at first:</p>
<pre><code>with open("test.txt","r") as file:
 file.split("\n")
</code></pre>
<p>and here is another code I wrote because the first code I wrote didn't work:</p>
<pre><code>txt=open("test.txt")
file=txt.read()
file.split("\n")
</code></pre>
<p>what is the difference between <code>"r"</code> and <code>.read()</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>.read()</code> function is for <strong>reading</strong> data from a file; So the file should be in <strong>read mode</strong> and the read mode is <code>'r'</code> that you asked. </p>
<p>So <code>'r'</code>is <strong>Mode for File</strong> and <code>.read()</code> is a function for <strong>reading data</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>read()</code> is the actual function that does the reading of any "path-like object," returning a "file-like object" (this is due to the principle of duck typing). You can optionally pass it a parameter, which is a single character, indicating what "mode" to open the path-like object. Look at the signature for <code>read():</code></p>
<pre><code>open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that the default mode is 'r', thus, if you do not specify a mode, it will default to 'r' anyways, so including 'r' as you did is generally redundant.</p>

<p>The <code>r</code>, You can think of it as the purpose of opening a file. if you open a file with <code>r</code>, and then you can't do write with the handler! You should got some error as :</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
IOError: File not open for writing
</code></pre>
<p><code>read()</code> just a way which you can got your data from file handler! there are also have <code>readline()</code> available.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>r</code> is a letter and <code>read</code> is a function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are comparing apples with bananas. what is your actual problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, the <code>r</code> missing in the second code has nothing to do with the fact that the first didn't work. Hint: Read the error message you'd have received.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the <code>'r'</code> argument to <code>open</code> makes no difference in the two code snippets. Indeed, <code>'r'</code> is already the default argument: <code>open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)</code></span>
