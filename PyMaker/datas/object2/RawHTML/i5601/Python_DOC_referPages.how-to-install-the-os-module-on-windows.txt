<p>I'm trying to install the <code>os</code> python module on Windows.</p>
<p>In a <code>cmd</code> console, I typed:</p>
<p><code>C:\Users\username&gt; pip install os
Collecting os
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement os (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for os
</code></p>
<p>So I guessed the module was not available on Windows for some reasons, but I found references of it in some SO questions.</p>
<p>Obviously, typing <code>Windows</code> and <code>os</code> in Google only gives me answers about Windows itself.</p>
<p>So, how can I install the <code>os</code> module on Windows ?</p>

<p>OS is python's standard library. So no need to download it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why are you trying to install it? <code>os</code> is part of the standard library, so if you have Python, you have <code>os</code> already. <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/os.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#module-os" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os</code></a> is a standard Python module, there's no need install it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MattBall emacs jedi needs it, but doesn't find it And when in the console, the os functions return <code>no module named os</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This sounds like an example of <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/66377/133242">the XY problem</a>. I would suggest that you post another question, with the details of the specific error you're seeing, in the context of emacs jedi.</span>
