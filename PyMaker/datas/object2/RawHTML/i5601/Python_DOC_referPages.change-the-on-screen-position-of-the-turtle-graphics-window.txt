<p>Is it possible to change the position of the turtle console on screen?</p>
<p>My main objective is to write code that can move the window, that's all.</p>
<p>I'm using Python 3.4.0 under Windows 10.</p>
<p>If any extra information is needed please ask.</p>

<p>Why do folks <em>always</em> jump into <code>tkinter</code> before reading the turtle documentation?</p>
<p>Yes, you can set the screen position of the turtle graphics window using the same <code>setup()</code> method you use to size it:</p>
<pre><code>from turtle import Turtle, Screen

def animate():
    global offset

    screen.setup(width=0.333, height=0.333, startx=offset, starty=offset)

    turtle.dot(offset)

    offset += 10

    if offset &lt; 300:
        screen.ontimer(animate, 100)

screen = Screen()

turtle = Turtle()

offset = 30

animate()

screen.exitonclick()
</code></pre>
<p><code>startx</code>, if positive, is the starting position in pixels from the left edge of the screen, or from the right edge if negative.  Similarly, <code>starty</code>, if positive, is the starting position from the top edge of the screen, or from the bottom edge if negative.  By default, the window is centered on the screen.</p>
<p>Your title asks about the position of the <strong><em>Turtle Graphics</em></strong> window on the screen but the body of your question asks about the <strong><em>Turtle Console</em></strong>.  These might be considered two different windows.</p>

<p>I can't tell if you just want to set the initial position of the window or actually move the window around the screen so I rewrote my example to demonstrate the later.</p>

<p>Yes. You need to get the root window that contains the Tkinter Canvas that the turtle is using as its <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.TurtleScreen" rel="nofollow noreferrer">TurtleScreen</a>. Once you have that window you can change its <a href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/wm.htm#Tkinter.Wm.geometry-method" rel="nofollow noreferrer">geometry</a>. </p>
<p>Here's a simple demo.</p>
<pre><code>import turtle

turtle.setup(width=0.5, height=0.5)
screen = turtle.Screen()

width, height = screen.window_width(), screen.window_height()
canvas = screen.getcanvas()

left, top = 30, 100
geom = '{}x{}+{}+{}'.format(width, height, left, top)
canvas.master.geometry(geom)

t = turtle.Turtle()
turtle.exitonclick()

<span class="comment-copy">Sorry I didn't specify this I just wan the Turtle Graphics window to open in a position and stay still afterwards.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">turtle.setup(0.5,0.75,startx = 0,starty = 0) thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since you're calling <code>turtle.setup()</code> anyway, why not simply specify its optional <code>startx</code> and <code>starty</code> arguments and avoid the extra code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cdlane The OP said they want to <i>change</i> the window's position. They didn't say anything about setting its initial placement.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">True, but my question stil stands.  ;-)  The <code>setup()</code> methods appears up to the task, on my OS X system, I don't know what happens on Windows.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cdlane Ah, ok. I must confess I've never tried to modify the Turtle screen via <code>.setup</code>. And I don't use Windows either, so I have no idea how it behaves there.</span>
