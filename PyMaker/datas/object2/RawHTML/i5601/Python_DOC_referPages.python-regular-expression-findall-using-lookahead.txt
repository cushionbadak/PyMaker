<p>I'm new to regular expressions and would like to understand how <strong>findall()</strong> and <strong>lookahead</strong> can be used to find all occurrences of a given pattern within a string. I am having problems with alternating characters. Here is an example of what I want:</p>
<pre><code>s = 'ababa4abaab'
p = 'aba'
print([ s[i:i+len(p)] for i in range(len(s)) if s[i:i+len(p)]==p])
['aba', 'aba', 'aba']
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my attempt with findall():</p>
<pre><code>import re
re.findall('aba', 'ababa4abaab')
['aba', 'aba']
</code></pre>
<p>It only returns 2 matches but I want all three. I read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> tutorial but did not quite understand. I tried</p>
<pre><code>re.findall('(?=aba)', 'ababa4abaab')
['', '', '']
</code></pre>
<p>Can someone please tell me how to use this lookahead concept in this case and provide a brief explanation of how it works?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you just need to search either there is an 'ab' and 'a' right after,
You don't need to catch it as 'aba', you can use this look ahead:</p>
<pre><code>ab(?=a)
</code></pre>
<p>which gives you 3 matches.</p>
<p>you can also capture it inside a group and then iterate each one of them and concatenate 'a' so you'll end with the desired text 'aba' for each match</p>
<pre><code> (ab(?=a))
</code></pre>

<p>Official doc about <strong>findall</strong> says it</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Return a list of all <strong>non-overlapping</strong> matches in the string."</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is your question about ? findall(), lookahead or finding recurring patterns ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So, you want overlapping patterns. Use <code>import regex as re; re.findall('aba', 'ababa4abaab', overlapped=True)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Possible duplicate of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5616822/python-regex-find-all-overlapping-matches">Python regex find all overlapping matches?</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Key thing is capturing the stuff you lookahead for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your regex quite literally means, find every empty string which is followed by "aba".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it works! Thank you!</span>
