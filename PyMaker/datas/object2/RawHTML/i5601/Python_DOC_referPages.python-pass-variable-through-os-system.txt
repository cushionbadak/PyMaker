<p>Since <code>PlayfileDir</code> is a variable that is a <code>string</code>, you can just concatenate it to <code>'start'</code> (as pointed out by <code>@cdarke</code>, you need to also add the quotes!). As you have it at the moment, you are trying to start the actual string <code>'PlayfileDir'</code>, not the string in the variable.</p>
<p>So, you should do something like:</p>
<pre><code>os.system('start "' + PlayfileDir + '"')
</code></pre>

<p>This is a great opportunity to start using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html?highlight=pathlib" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pathlib</code></a>!</p>
<pre><code>from pathlib import Path

p = input("Gimme a path: ")

newest_mp3 = sorted(Path(p).glob('*.mp3'), reverse=True, key=lambda p: p.stat().st_mtime)[0]

os.system('start "{}"'.format(newest_mp3))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Don't use <code>os.system</code>; use the <code>subprocess</code> module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Save yourself some trouble and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess.run()</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your file path is wrong. The file is located in <code>path</code>, not in <code>os.getcwd()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But there are many things wrong here. In all the other calls, to build up the command using string concatenation. Why don't you do that in the last one as well?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't you means <code>os.system('start \'{}\''.format(PlayfileDir))</code>? And btw - please - don't use camelcase, snakecase ftw!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that the <code>PlayfileDir</code> variable already has a string. No need for the cast.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Code-Apprentice Yep</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cdarke Thanks! Am on Linux, so couldn't test this but definitely key!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JoeIddon: would apply to Linux as well, although no one in their right mind would have a directory name which includes whitespace :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi this works well but it opens a command window in which i have to type the file name to play it. Is there a way to do this automatically</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and does this replace all the code like I think</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead of doing <code>os.system(...)</code>, do a <code>print(...)</code> and see what is being generated.</span>
