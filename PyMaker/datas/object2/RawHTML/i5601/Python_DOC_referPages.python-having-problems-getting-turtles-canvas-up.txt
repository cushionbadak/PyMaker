<p>I just got a book on kids coding in Python for Christmas.  I was really excited to use it and downloaded the app immediately.  The book said to use this code to import Turtle:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import turtle
</code></pre>
<p>Then it said this to create a canvas:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = turtle.Pen ()
</code></pre>
<p>This error message appeared.</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#2&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    t = turtle.Pen ()
AttributeError: module 'turtle' has no attribute 'Pen'
</code></pre>
<p>What does this mean?  How do I get Turtle's canvas up?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use</p>
<pre><code># load the turtle module
import turtle

# the imported module turtle has a Turtle() that moves around 
# give your turtle a name so you can refer to turtle.Turtle() by the shorter name
# tim (i.e.)
tim = turtle.Turtle()

# Move tim
tim.forward(50)

# end turtling
turtle.done()
</code></pre>
<p><code>tim</code> ( the <code>turtle.Turtle()</code> ) can do many more things, this page holds informations about the turtle, its methods and some exampels:  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html</a></p>

<p>After import turtle, you want to enter a variable name which is to call the turtle via that variable.</p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle
your_variable_name = turtle.Turtle()
</code></pre>
<p>After that, you want to accessed into the turtle.</p>
<pre><code>your_variable_name.pencolor('blue')
</code></pre>

<p>What you did is in fact <em>correct</em>, despite the comments and other answers:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import turtle
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = turtle.Pen ()
</code></pre>
<p>for example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; python3
Python 3.6.0 (v3.6.0:41df79263a11, Dec 22 2016, 17:23:13)

&gt;&gt;&gt; import turtle
&gt;&gt;&gt; t = turtle.Pen()
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
&lt;turtle.Turtle object at 0x101ca4ac8&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; ^D
</code></pre>
<p>The question is, why didn't it work for <em>you</em>?  My initial guess is you've created a file called <code>turtle.py</code> on your working directory -- if so rename it or delete it and try again.  Otherwise Python finds your turtle.py file instead of the Python library turtle.py file when you <code>import turtle</code>.  If that's not the case:</p>
<p>My second guess is you're using a limited Python environment that implements it's own subset of turtle.  For example online coding with turtle on <a href="https://trinket.io/turtle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://trinket.io/turtle</a> uses such a subset where <code>Pen()</code> won't work but <code>Turtle()</code> (it's alias in the standard turtle library) works just fine. So try <code>Turtle()</code> instead of <code>Pen()</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks!  I tried that but it doesn't seem to solve the problem.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@gogaz, both <code>Pen()</code> and <code>pen()</code> exist in turtle but have different meanings.  The lower case <code>pen()</code> is <b>not</b> what the OP wants in this case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi!  Thank you so much for your help!  I have solved the problem by entering the first code into the Apple Terminal.  Thank you so much for helping me get Python working!  I am so excited to use Turtle!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This still doesn't work.  The error message this time is:                      Traceback (most recent call last):   File "&lt;pyshell#4&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;     turtle.turtle.pen() AttributeError: module 'turtle' has no attribute 'pen'                                              Is there another way?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StarlightJenna use <code>turtle.Turtle().pen()</code>  - or give the turtle a shorter name: <code>tim = turtle.Turtle()</code> -then you can use <code>tim.pen()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>turtle.Pen()</code> is an alias for <code>turtle.Turtle()</code> so this doesn't explain why the OP had a problem, nor necessarily fix it.  Calling the <code>pen()</code> method is completely unrelated to the OP's issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">turtle.Pen() is an alias for turtle.Turtle() so this doesn't explain why the OP had a problem, nor necessarily fix it.</span>
