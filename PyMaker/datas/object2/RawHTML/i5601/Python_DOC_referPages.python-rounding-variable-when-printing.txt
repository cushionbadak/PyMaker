<p>I'm new to python so sorry if I word my question improperly but bear with me. So basically I am making a program to calculate the odds of randomly generating the chosen sides of a (x) sided dice. Problem is when I try to print the variable "idealProb", it seems to rounds down to 0 unless its 100% probability, however in the debugger it says the actual decimal it is only when it prints into the terminal that is gets messed up.</p>
<pre><code>import random
import sys
import os
import time

clear = lambda: os.system('cls')
clear()

rolls = []
sides = []
x = 1

totalSides = int(input("How many sides do you want this die to have?"))
clear()

numSides = int(input("How many of those sides are you trying to land on?"))
nS = numSides

while numSides &gt;= 1:
    clear()
    s = int(input("Possibility %i:" %(x)))
    sides.append(s)
    numSides -= 1
    x += 1

idealProb = nS / totalSides

print("Ideal probability: %i" %(idealProb))
</code></pre>
<p>P.S. Any other comments on my code, any advice on how to make it less messy or a easier way to do what I'm doing please let me know I am fairly new to Python and coding in general, as Python is my first language. Thank you so much for all the help!</p>

<p>When you write %i I'm the print command you explicitly tell Python to truncate the value to an integer.

<p>Change your last line to output <code>idealProb</code> as a floating point number by using <code>%f</code> instead of as an integer with <code>%i</code> as you have it. That would make the last line:</p>
<pre><code>print("Ideal probability: %f" %(idealProb))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It's the <code>%i</code> that explicitly instructs Python to make an integer representation. Try something like <code>%f</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">or just use <code>f"Ideal probability: {idealProb}"</code> (which is new in Python 3.6)</span>
