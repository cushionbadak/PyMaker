<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I came across the code below and I am wondering what the small circle/degree sign means. The code is supposed to extract text between Item 1A and Item B. Thank you!</p>
<pre><code>(?s)(?i)°Item 1A.*?°Item
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The degree symbol, <code>°</code> is treated as a literal character to be matched. Your input probably looks like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>°Item 1A: Giraffes. Girrafes are taller than anteaters.
°Item 1B: Elephants. Elephants are taller than anteaters.
°Item 1C: Ants. Ants are shorter than anteaters.
</code></pre>
<p>So your regular expression starts its match at <code>°Item1A</code> and continues through the first subsequent <code>°Item</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Isn't it part of the string to match? what is the input string for this regex?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not a duplicate. Nothing in the referenced duplicate describes <code>°</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And to answer in a comment, <code>°</code> is treated as a literal character. I presume the input language uses it as a bullet marking the items.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Robᵩ I'm pretty sure it's part of the string to match itself. I don't see how non-ASCII (32-127) chars would be a part of the special regex chars. I agree it's not a duplicate. but since it's part of the string to match, it's just "unclear" or sth like that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is not part of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expression syntax</a>.</span>
