<pre><code>import subprocess

src_file = '/../copy_me_test.txt'

</code></pre>
<p>So I am copying a file from one directory to another. When I run the subprocess.call() method it returns a 1. Except that nothing happens and I get the following message on my terminal.</p>
<pre><code>cp: /Users/my_name/Desktop/python/copy_files/copy_me_test.txt: No such file or directory
1
</code></pre>
<p>What's going on here? Shouldn't this return a 0 since it failed to make a copy of the file. I made a work around already but I would like to know if anyone knows why this is happening? Any information or links would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Return 0 is success. Not 0 is failure. Return code can be a 32 bit integer from 0 to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4,294,967,295" rel="nofollow noreferrer">4294967295</a>. Look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status#POSIX" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Exit status</a> based on operating system.</p>
<p>Sometimes a negative return code may be set or received as Python 3 docs confirm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Popen.returncode</p>
<p>The child return code, set by poll() and wait() (and indirectly by communicate()). A None value indicates that the process hasnâ€™t terminated yet.</p>
<p>A negative value -N indicates that the child was terminated by signal N (POSIX only).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exit Python with <code>exit(-1)</code> results in <code>4294967295</code> on Windows so Python uses a unsigned 32 bit return code.</p>

<p>According to the documentation here <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html</a> it will return 1 when it fails, also check that there is a warning if you use the attribute shell=True</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Side-note: Don't use shell programs when you don't need them. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copyfile" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shutil.copyfile</code> and friends</a> to do this directly from within Python, with no fragile/hard to error check/non-portable external program usage.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'll do that. I'm new to python so I appreciate the advice. I don't really understand what you meant by" no fragile/hard to error check/non-portable external program usage."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead of catching exceptions in Python when you call a executable as a subprocess you have to capture the return code and compare it to constant, known error codes in an if-else ladder. This makes it hard to use. The error codes may also be different depending on the platform your script runs on, potentially making it non-portable. The return codes may also change in a newer version of the executable, making them fragile.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well that actually makes a lot of sense. You have given me a lot to think about. Thank you for explaining that. I'll try to keep that in mind next time I am doing these kinds of tasks in my programs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. I realize now that I misunderstood the meaning of the return values. Thank you for explaining it to me in more detail. I see now why 0 is used as a marker for success.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much. That checks out. While the documentation was a little confusing I ran my program a couple of times and the results were consistent with what you said. I was following a tutorial. I must have misunderstood it. Thanks again.</span>
