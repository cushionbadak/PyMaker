<p>I use Windows 7.</p>
<pre><code>myfile = open("matedata.txt", "a+")
print myfile.readline()
myfile.write("1")
myfile.close()
</code></pre>
<p>And this doesn't work.</p>
<pre><code>myfile.write("1")
IOError: [Errno 0] Error
</code></pre>

<p>When you open a file with python, you need to specify the type of access you want (read, write or append):</p>
<ul>
<li>a - for appending</li>
<li>r - for reading</li>
<li>w - for writing</li>
</ul>
<p>the '+' means update/create new if doesn't exists.</p>
<p>you getting IOError because you open file and you try to do both reading and writing with the same FD(file discreptor)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How come i can't edit my post? Myfile is an empty file. myfile.readline() returns "nothing"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What happens if you change it to a file that doesn't exist?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What happens if you do not read from this file - just write?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is probably unrelated to your error, but you should use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>with</code> statement</a> to handle your open file, rather than explicitly closing it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're running windows, you opened the file in <code>a+</code> mode, and did a read operation before a write operation.  This makes windows unhappy for whatever reason.  I remember there being a workaround if you really need to do this, but really just don't read and write in <code>a+</code> mode.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Incorrect.  Reading and writing is possible with the same file.  See the documentation (<a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open</a>), which says that <code>+</code> does not mean to create a file, but instead it means to open a file for both reading and writing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In addition to what Dietrich Epp said, if the file doesn't exists, 'w' mode will create it, no need for the use of '+'.</span>
