<p>I have a Python script which converts a decimal number into a binary one and this obviously uses their input.</p>
<p>I would like to have the script validate that the input is a number and not anything else which will stop the script.</p>
<p>I have tried an if/else statement but I don't really know how to go about it. I have tried <code>if decimal.isint():</code> and <code>if decimal.isalpha():</code> but they just throw up errors when I enter a string.</p>
<pre><code>print("Welcome to the Decimal to Binary converter!")
while True:
    print("Type a decimal number you wish to convert:")
    decimal = int(input())
    if decimal.isint():
        binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
        print(binary)
    else:
        print("Please enter a number.")
</code></pre>
<p>Without the if/else statement, the code works just fine and does its job.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If the <code>int()</code> call succeeded, <code>decimal</code> is <strong>already</strong> a number. You can only call <code>.isdigit()</code> (the correct name) on a string:</p>
<pre><code>decimal = input()
if decimal.isdigit():
    decimal = int(decimal)
</code></pre>
<p>The alternative is to use exception handling; if a <code>ValueError</code> is thrown, the input was not a number:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    print("Type a decimal number you wish to convert:")
    try:
        decimal = int(input())
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a number.")
        continue

    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of using the <code>bin()</code> function and removing the starting <code>0b</code>, you could also use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#format"><code>format()</code> function</a>, using the <code>'b'</code> format, to format an integer as a binary string, without the leading text:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; format(10, 'b')
'1010'
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>format()</code> function makes it easy to add leading zeros:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; format(10, '08b')
'00001010'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">In Python 2.x, you wouldn't need to call <code>isdigit</code>, infact, that would throw an error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@elssar: this is clearly not Python 2. In Python 2, you'd use <code>raw_input()</code> in this case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well yes, but I thought it should be worth mentioning that in the answer. In my haste I forgot to mention that bit :/</span>
