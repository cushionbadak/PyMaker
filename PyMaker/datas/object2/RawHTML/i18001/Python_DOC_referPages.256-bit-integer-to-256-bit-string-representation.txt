<p>in python i'm using the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycrypto" rel="nofollow">Crypto package</a> to generate a random number of length 256 bit. The function for doing so is </p>
<pre><code>import Crypto.Random.random as rand
key = rand.getrandbits(256)  
</code></pre>
<p>This gives something like:</p>
<pre><code>112699108505435943726051051450940377552177626778909564691673845134467691053980
</code></pre>
<p>Now my is question how do i transform this number to a string of all ascii characters? Is there a build in function for doing so or do i need to convert it to binary and split it up in blocks of eight ones and zeros and do it myself? </p>
<p>Thans in advance.</p>

<p>I don't know if it's built in, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>But doing it yourself is not as easy as reinterpreting your data as bytes. This is because Ascii is a 7-bit encoding scheme. The most significant bit is always zero.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to convert your int to a packed array of bytes (<code>to_bytes</code>)[1] and then discard a bit from each byte, e.g. by right shifting. This wastes 1/8 of your entropy but makes for a cleaner program.</p>
<p>This only works because you're using a cryptographically secure source of random number generation. This means that each bit has an equal probability of being a one or zero - that is, each bit is uniformly distributed and independent of all others. [2]</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just pass the integer to the bin() builtin function. Slice off the leading "0b" if you don't want it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">After some more research i found this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7396849/convert-binary-to-ascii-and-vice-versa-python">link</a> this code dit the job. Thanks a lot for your answers. I didn't knew anything about how many bits ascii used. This was a really helpful description.</span>
