<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to write a program that writes the same letter to each recipient and each address, but each letter will have the different names and address.</p>
<p>This is what i have so far.</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    recipients = [] #should be names
    adresses = [] #letters and numbers

    filename = input("Please enter the name of the template file: ")
    file = open(filename, 'w')
    recipients = input("Please enter names of recipients: ")
    adresses = input("Please list addresses: ")

    for names in recipients:
        letter = "New York, New York\n17 November 2013\n \n", recipients[names], "\n" ,adresses, "\n\nDear",recipients[names],"\n\n" \
        "Thank you for your service to New York City, and\nin particular, to the education of its residents.\nThose in", adresses, "appreciate it!"\
        "\n\nBest wishes to", recipients[names], "and your family,\n\n"

        file.write(str(letter))

    file.close()
main()
</code></pre>
<p>When it writes out to the file it just writes one letter and just puts everything together.</p>
<p>What i want to be done is for a letter to DIFFERENT people and Different addresses in the SAME file. </p>
<p>Ex. This will all be in the SAME file.</p>
<pre><code>   New York, New York

<p>Any help?</p>
<p>Using Python 3.x</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are several issues with your code.</p>
<p>First off, you're requesting a list of names and addresses, but you only get a single string from <code>input</code>. If you expect your user to specify several values, you'll need to parse that input string somehow to split up the values. For instance, you could split on commas:</p>
<pre><code>recipients_str = input("Please enter names of recipients: ")
recipients = recipients_str.split(",")
</code></pre>
<p>The next issue you have is that your loop doesn't do what you appear to expect. In Python, a <code>for</code> loop gives you the values from the sequence you're looping on, not indexes. So, try:</p>
<pre><code>for name in recipients:
</code></pre>
<p>Or, since you also have a list of addresses which should correspond to the list of names, use <code>zip</code> and get both name and address together:</p>
<pre><code>for name, address in zip(recipients, addresses):
</code></pre>
<p>Next, you have issues with the code to create your letter string. You're currently making a tuple of strings, not a single one. A much better approach would be to use <code>str.format</code> to handle inserting the various values into the template:</p>
<pre><code>letter_template = """New York, New York
11 March 2013
{name}
{address}

Dear {name},

Thank you for your service to New York City, and,
in particular, to the education of its residents.
Those in {address} appreciate it!

Best wishes to {name} and your family
"""

letter = letter_template.format(name=name, address=address)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to write to a separate file for each recipient, rather than writing to the same file as you are currently doing: </p>
<pre><code>def main():
    recipients = [] #should be names
    adresses = [] #letters and numbers

    recipients = input("Please enter names of recipients: ")
    adresses = input("Please list addresses: ")

    for names in recipients:
        letter = "CONTENTS OF LETTER"

        filename = input("Please enter the name of the template file: ")
        file = open(filename, 'w')
        file.write(str(letter))
        file.close()

main()
</code></pre>
<p>Be mindful that you'll be prompted for a new template file name for each iteration of the loop. You'll also need to ensure that each template name is unique so that prior files are not overwritten.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>your problem is that you need to write a unique file for each letter, the section of code below should be modified to create a file for each letter, you could do something like creating a counter and appending it to the filename to keep them unique.</p>
<pre><code>    for names in recipients:
        letter = "New York, New York\n17 November 2013\n \n", recipients[names], "\n" ,adresses, "\n\nDear",recipients[names],"\n\n" \
        "Thank you for your service to New York City, and\nin particular, to the education of its residents.\nThose in", adresses, "appreciate it!"\
        "\n\nBest wishes to", recipients[names], "and your family,\n\n"

        file.write(str(letter))

    file.close()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Aside from whatever your main problem is, your <code>letter</code> object is going to be a tuple of 11 strings, which means <code>str(letter)</code> is going to show up with 11 quoted and escaped strings with commas between them and parentheses around the whole thing. You need to look at <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.format</code></a>, or other ways of building up strings.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While you're at it, look at the explanation of triple-quoted strings in the tutorial's <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Strings</a> section.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it's not clear the problem you are trying to solve, try explaining exactly the output you want and what you currently have</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CameronSparr Edited to make this more clear</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem is that <code>recipients</code> and <code>addresses</code> should be lists of names and addresses. At the moment they are just strings, so the <code>for</code> loop won't work properly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">With this comment you actually taught me alot, i didnt know i could do some of those things. I am currently working to see if i figure this out with what you showed me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I WANT them in the same file. This is the tricky part</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then I'm afraid that your question may not be asking what you're meaning to ask. Care to rephrase?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i edited to make it more clear</span>
