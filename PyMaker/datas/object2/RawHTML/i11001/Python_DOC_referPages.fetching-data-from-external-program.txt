<p>I have an external program, <a href="https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack" rel="nofollow">opentrack</a>, that tracks head position using IR LED's. The position is updated in the program in real-time, but my problem is that I would like to get that data into my python code. Is it possible to do this? </p>
<p>I've been looking into subprocesses and things like that, but I still don't understand how to do it. Sorry for the very general question but I just need someone to point me into the right direction or to tell me that it isn't really possible.</p>

<p>The page you linked to clearly lists no fewer than 9 different ways in which opentrack can output the data.</p>
<p>So you need to figure out which one to use, and write Python code to act as a receiver for one of those methods. Perhaps UDP, since that sounds simple enough.</p>
<p>Hint: to decode any binary format, you're probably going to want to become familiar with Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html" rel="nofollow">struct</a> module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I used UDP and I'm getting some data feed to my python program. However it's in some strange format so I can't really interpret it, but it's definitely a start.</span>
