<p>I can't figure out how you find a percentage of a variable in Python. This is the example of the code:</p>
<pre><code>money =546.97
week=0
for i in range(10):
    money=money+16
    money=money+(5% money)
    print('you have',money,'dollars')
    week=week+4
    print(week)
i = i +1
</code></pre>
<p>It always just adds 21 because it sees 5% and gives the equation (5% money) the value of 5.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>%</code> symbol in python is the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12754680/modulo-operator-in-python">modulo operator</a> in python. </p>
<p>It doesn't compute a percent, rather <code>x % y</code> determines the remainder after dividing <code>x</code> by <code>y</code>. </p>
<p>If you want the percentage of a variable, you just have to multiply it by the decimal value of the percent:</p>
<pre><code>money * .05
# 5 % of money
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>While the <code>%</code> symbol means "percent of" to us, it means <em>an entirely different thing</em> to Python.</p>
<p>In Python, <code>%</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation" rel="nofollow"><em>modulo operator</em></a>. Takes the thing on the left, divides it by the thing on the right, and <em>returns the remainder of the division</em>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 9 % 4
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; 9 % 3
0
</code></pre>
<p>So when you do <code>5% money</code>, Python reads it as "divide <code>5</code> by <code>money</code> and return the remainder". That's not what you want at all!</p>
<p>To answer the question, we need to look at <em>what</em> a percentage is. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/percent" rel="nofollow"><em>Percent</em></a> comes from Latin <em>per cent</em>, meaning "per one hundred things". So "five percent" literally means "take five out of every hundred things." Okay, great! So what?</p>
<p>So to find a percentage of a number, you must <em>multiply</em> that number by its decimal percentage value. 5% is the same thing as <code>0.05</code>, because <code>0.05</code> represents "five one-hundredths" or "five things for every hundred things".</p>
<hr/>
<p>Let's rewrite your code a little bit (and I'll clean up the formatting somewhat).</p>
<pre><code>money = 546.97
for i in range(10):
    week = i * 4
    money += 16
    money += (0.05 * money)
    print("On week {week} you have {money:.2f} dollars.".format(week=week, money=money))
</code></pre>
<p>I made a few adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of manually incrementing both <code>i</code> and <code>week</code>, let the loop take care of that; that's what it's for, after all!</li>
<li>Replaced <code>(5% money)</code> with <code>(0.05 * money)</code>, which is how Python will understand what you want</li>
<li>Replaced your print statements with a single statement

<ul>
<li>Used the advanced formatting <code>{__:.2f}</code> to produce a number that cuts off to just two decimal places (which is usual for money, but you can erase the <code>:.2f</code> if you want the full floating-point value)</li>
<li>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow">6.1.3 — Format String Syntax</a> for more information about how these arguments work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Replaced statements like <code>money = money + x</code> with <code>money += x</code> because it's more concise and easier to read to advanced programmers (in my opinion)</li>
<li>Adjusted whitespace around operators for readability</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">For example, 8 percent of <code>x</code> is just <code>0.08*x</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ForceBru: <code>0.08 * x</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ForceBru: <code>0.8</code> is 80%</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oops, my Python is relatively good, but my math seems to be not as brilliant :D</span>
