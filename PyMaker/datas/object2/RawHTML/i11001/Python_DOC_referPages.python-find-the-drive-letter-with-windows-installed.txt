<p>I started making a program for fun when I encountered a problem. The problem was that I wanted to find the drive letter with windows installed on it (root drive). I assumed there was a function already made for that but I searched for a while and could not find one. </p>
<p>I wrote this code to do what I just described. Is this code redundant and am I being an idiot? There is probably a much easier way...</p>
<pre><code>def root():

root = ""
i = 0
drives = win32api.GetLogicalDriveStrings()
drives = drives.split("\000")[:-1]

for i in range(0, len(drives)):
    drives[i] = drives[i].replace("\\", "/")

i = 0
for i in range(0, len(drives)):

    if os.path.exists(drives[i] + "Windows"):
        root = drives[i]
        break

return root
</code></pre>
<p>I suppose someone can use this for testing purposes or what not.</p>

<p>There is an environment variable <code>windir</code>. On my computer in contains "C:\Windows". You can read this variable by <code>os.getenv('WINDIR')</code> (refer to <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.getenv" rel="nofollow">python 2:os.getenv()</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getenv" rel="nofollow">python 3:os.getenv()</a>).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You have available both <code>GetSystemDirectory</code> and <code>GetWindowsDirectory</code> - I imagine either to be helpful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Important to note that windows doesn't have to be installed to a directory called 'Windows'. Your solution is the only consistently reliable way to do it. As a side note: on python 3.5 you can also use <code>os.environ['windir']</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>os.environ</code> is not restricted to python 3.5. Ist exists in python 2.7 as well (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.environ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python 2.7: os.envirion</a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since the goal is to get the <b>drive letter</b> that Windows is installed on, you should use the <code>systemdrive</code> environment variable instead of <code>windir</code>.</span>
