<p>I am looking to view and manipulate the 1s and 0s of a file. What I gather I need is to generate/view the .bin file of a given file, which could be anything from a photo to a document. How do I go about getting the .bin file for a file in my python code?</p>

<p>All files are technically "bin" files since they are simply a sequence of bytes.  Open the file with <code>open('name', 'rb')</code> so that it is in "binary" or raw mode.  See the documentation for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow">open</a> for more information.  Then read the bytes into a variable using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.BufferedIOBase.read" rel="nofollow"><code>file.read</code></a>.  You can dump the binary representation of a file using something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function

def dump_file(name):
    with open(name, 'rb') as in_file:
        for data in in_file:
            for a_byte in data:
                print('{:08b}'.format(ord(a_byte)), end='')
        print('')
</code></pre>
