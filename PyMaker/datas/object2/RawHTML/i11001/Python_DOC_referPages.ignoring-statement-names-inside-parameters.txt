<p>When creating a function in PyCharm an error occurred as I tried to use a statement (in my case the <em>try</em> statement) as a parameter. </p>
<p>I also do get an error at second line due to Python tries to resolve the <em>try</em> as well.</p>
<pre><code>def currency_converter_to_dkk(try):
    amount = float(try * 2.25)
    print(amount)

def currency_converter_to_try(dkk):
    amount = float(DKK * 0.4436)
    print(amount)
</code></pre>
<p>and since the PEP8 name conventions I 'cannot' change the parameter to uppercase.</p>
<p>Is there any way to circumvent this issue?</p>

<p><code>try</code> is a keyword in Python used in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-try-statement" rel="nofollow">the <code>try</code> statement</a>. You cannot use keywords as a name.</p>
<p>You need to use another name. Appending an underscore is a very common practice.</p>
<pre><code>def currency_converter_to_dkk(try_):
    amount = float(try_ * 2.25)
    print(amount)

<span class="comment-copy">That's not a PyCharm problem, your code is wrong - <code>try</code> is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords" rel="nofollow noreferrer">keyword</a> and cannot be used as a parameter name. Also <code>try</code> seems like a bad name for the parameter to begin with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"and since the PEP8 name conventions I 'cannot' change the parameter to uppercase." PEP8 also reads: "A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds". Although <code>try_</code> would still be better than <code>Try</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you are using <code>try</code> to represent the Turkish Lira, maybe use <code>cc_try</code>, <code>try_</code>, <code>try_curr</code> or something of that nature.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, you should probably call your functions something like <code>try_to_dkk</code> and <code>dkk_to_try</code> instead of <code>currency_converter_to_dkk</code>. Euro is a currency, but your function doesn't convert euro to dkk.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd do something like this: <a href="http://pastebin.com/T7SAKA08" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pastebin.com/T7SAKA08</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So there is no way to use exactly 'try' as parameter and to avoid it you simply use an underscore?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rakozay, You can <code>try</code> as is. Appending underscore is an example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rakozay No, there is no way to use <code>try</code> as a parameter's name. Appending an underscore is a very common practice, so I wouldn't worry about using <code>try_</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jonrsharpe I just thought that maybe being specific would be a great idea as I have several other currencies to convert, but I see that the parameter name can be used again and again</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MarkusMeskanen Alright, thanks.</span>
