<p>I've been having trouble finding alternative ways in which Python can be ran with the -O flag. Are there any other ways besides including in a script that calls the IDLE and .py file?</p>
<p>Is a script necessary? Can it be included in the .py file itself?</p>

<p>You can set an environment variable. From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-O" rel="nofollow"><code>-O</code> switch documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turn on basic optimizations. This changes the filename extension for compiled (bytecode) files from <code>.pyc</code> to <code>.pyo</code>. <strong>See also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONOPTIMIZE" rel="nofollow"><code>PYTHONOPTIMIZE</code></a>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bold emphasis mine. The linked <code>PYTHONOPTIMIZE</code> environment variable documentation states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the <code>-O</code> option. If set to an integer, it is equivalent to specifying <code>-O</code> multiple times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no other methods of enabling this mode, so yes, you need to either invoke Python with the command line switch from another script, or use <em>something</em> to set the environment variable before running Python. </p>
<p>You can't enable it from the <code>.py</code> file as it needs to be enabled <em>before</em> the Python code is parsed and compiled.</p>
<p>Note that the only thing <code>-O</code> does is omit <code>assert</code> statements from the code being run, and to set the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html?highlight=__debug__#__debug__" rel="nofollow"><code>__debug__</code> global constant</a> to <code>False</code> (it is set to <code>True</code> otherwise). If <code>-O</code> was specified twice, docstrings are removed from the bytecode too, giving you <em>slightly</em> smaller bytecode files.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the explanation - is there a more beginner friendly resource on how to use environment variables than the official documentation? It reads almost like gibberish to a beginner like me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What OS are you using? There are loads of resources on environment variables for any OS you care about.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am using Windows 10.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't use Windows myself, surely there are loads of tutorials that explain environment variables on Windows?</span>
