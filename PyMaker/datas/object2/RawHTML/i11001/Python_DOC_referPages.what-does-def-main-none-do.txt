<p>I am working through Mastering Matplotlib and in chapter two they introduce the following code snippet:</p>
<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env python3.4
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def main () -&gt; None:
    plt.plot([1,2,3,4])
    plt.ylabel('some numbers')
    plt.savefig('simple-line.png')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>This can be seen in <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/masteringmatplotlib/architecture/blob/master/notebooks/mmpl-arch.ipynb" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> notebook, cell 10. I have never seen a main method defined this way, what is the function of <code>-&gt; None</code>? 
My only thought so far is that this may be similar to <code>def main(argv=None)</code>?</p>
<p>Beyond that, what is <code>-&gt;</code> in Python? I can't find it in <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> list of Python operators.</p>

<p>As is, it does absolutely nothing. It is a type annotation for the <code>main</code> function that simply states that this function returns <code>None</code>. Type annotations were introduced in <code>Python 3.5</code> and are specified in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/" rel="noreferrer"><code>PEP 484</code></a>.</p>
<p>Annotations for the return value of a function use the symbol <code>-&gt;</code> followed by a type. It is completely optional and if you removed it, nothing would change.</p>
<p>This will have <em>absolutely no effect on execution</em>, it is only taken under consideration if you use it with a type checking tool like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/" rel="noreferrer"><code>mypy</code></a>.</p>
