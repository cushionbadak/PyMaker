<p>I have a very simple graph that I want to plot as svg. For example:</p>
<pre><code># graph.dot
graph { 
        a -- b; 
        b -- c; 
    } 
</code></pre>
<p>I am currently using pydot to read the file and then generate the svg file as follows:</p>
<pre><code>import pydot
graphs = pydot.graph_from_dot_file('graph.dot')
graphs[0].write_svg('graph.svg') # there is only 1 graph so the 0 index.
</code></pre>
<p>However, I need to do this without the need of intermediate files <code>graph.dot</code> and <code>graph.svg</code>. I have the code content of <code>graph.dot</code> in a string, corresponding to which I need the svg output in string.</p>
<p>I need something like:</p>
<pre><code>graph_dot = "... ..." # string, I have this
graph_svg = convert_dot_to_svg(graph_dot) 
# i need something like convert_dot_to_svg()
</code></pre>
<p>My question is not limited to pydot only. If anyone knows a web api using which I can do this, then also it will do.</p>
<p>Thanks a Lot, in advance.</p>

<p>After spending some more time looking at the available methods on <code>pydot</code> object and <code>graph</code> object, it could be figured out:</p>
<p>The following code works:</p>
<pre><code>import pydot    
dot_string = """graph { 
                    a -- b; 
                    b -- c; 
                } """

graphs = pydot.graph_from_dot_data( dot_string )
svg_string = graphs[0].create_svg() 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I've never used pydot (but I do know Graphviz), but a quick look at the pydot docs suggests that you can use a file-like object instead of a file. So you should try StringIO or BytesIO from the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">io</a> module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring you are right that I can use <code>io</code> to take input. But how to replace  the <code>write_svg</code> function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring As mentioned, question isn't limited to pydot itself. Can you tell me a way to get the svg string corresponding to dot string in Graphviz. Any way is fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If <code>.write_svg</code> accepts an open file handle instead of a file name, then it will "just work" if you supply it a StringIO or BytesIO object. If you've never used the <code>io</code> module before, I suggest you study the docs &amp; do a few experiments; it's a <i>very</i> useful module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok cool ... Thanks :)</span>
