<p>I want to put a python script with module script PIL on a server. The server might not have PIL installed. (This is why I want to load the file myself)</p>
<p>If possible, how can I have the python script import Image Library from the current directory of the script without having it installed on the machine?</p>
<hr/>
<p>Using python virtual machine
I am using v2.7 of python locally, as on server.</p>

<p>One option is to import modules from a relative path as described <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/279237/import-a-module-from-a-relative-path">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use virtual environments where you pack everything you need and donÂ´t mess with python installations on the server. Look it <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="http://chrisstrelioff.ws/sandbox/2014/09/16/python_3_4_on_ubuntu_14_04_using_virtual_environments.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why don't you use a virtualenv? If you install a python module in the virtual env, it won't affect your Python distribution installed on the machine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Someone jumped your gun by giving it as an answer. I should have mentioned that I have no Python experience.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Take a look here :  <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>   It's really simple, it creates a virtual environnement in wich your can install all dependencies for your script to run without affecting the machine Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. +1 however I am mending my question to include the version. Servers usually come standard with 2.7. I need the script to support that version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is a good answer! I used the relative import</span>
