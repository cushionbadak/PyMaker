<p>this allows me to add whatever I want to this list. However, Is there a way that I can keep the changes to the list so that when I run the program later all of the things I previously wrote will be on the list? </p>
<p>EDIT: If it matters, I use PyCharm for coding and running my progams</p>

<p>You can use <code>json</code> here.</p>
<pre><code>import json
try:
    list = json.load(open("database.json"))
except:
    list = []
while True:
    try:
        list.append(input())
        print(list)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        json.dump(list, open('database.json', 'w'))
</code></pre>
<p>This stores the content in a file called database.json, you can end the program with <code>CTRL+C</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You would need a persistence layer i.e a file system, database, <code>pickle</code>, <code>shelve</code> etc. where you can store the data present in <code>list</code> once the program has terminated. When you re-run your program, make sure it loads from the same persistence store, without initializing it to <code>[]</code> and that is how you would be able to store the elements appended to the list.</p>
<p>Python provides many alternatives as described <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/persistence.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to save the list somewhere first and then load it at the start of the program. Since it's just a simple list we can just use python pickle to save it to disk like this:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

try:
    with open('list.p', 'rb') as f:
        list = pickle.load(f)
except:
    list = []
while True:
    try:
        list.append(input())
        print(list)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        with open('list.p', 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(list, f)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Consider saving the list to a text file or wherever. Then you can just load the list from the source and append new records.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You'd need to dump the list to some persistent storage (e.g., a file, a database table) and read it when the program starts.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Gupta I tried that, but when I ran the program a second time the list contents had been removed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You were closing the program using?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">PyCharm, and I want to be able to close it in PyCharm too</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also I tried it in python and closed it with CTRL + C and that didn't work either</span>
<span class="comment-copy">After <code>json.dump(...</code> in the except clause do <code>exit()</code></span>
