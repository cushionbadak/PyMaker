<p>I need to form a list of <strong>Strings</strong> from an input. I've tried other answers, but they only work for numbers and only when there are no spaces in it. For example:</p>
<pre><code>Enter input: ["Test 1", "Test 2", "Test 3"]
["Test 1", "Test 2", "Test 3"]
</code></pre>
<p>or something similar. ( <code>Enter input: "Test 1", "Test 2", etc..</code> could also work)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For a case like this, you want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow"><code>ast.literal_eval</code></a>; as long as they enter a legitimate Python literal, it will work. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow"><code>json.loads</code></a> can also work, though it's less expressive than full Python literal syntax. Either way, you'd need to verify that it actually made a <code>list</code>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>import ast

bad = True
while bad:
    userinput = input("Enter text:")
    try:
        userlist = ast.literal_eval(userinput)
    except Exception:
        pass
    else:
        bad = not isinstance(userlist, list)
    if bad:
        print("Not a valid Python list")
# Once you get here, you have a legal list stored in userlist
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This way might be a bit more convenient: </p>
<pre><code>N_items = int(input('How many items? '))
my_list = [input('Enter a list item: ') for _ in range(N_items)]
</code></pre>
<p>By the way: getting an answer does not mean it is a good question. There is a reason you are getting downvoted. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">You need to show what you tried. Contrary to what you may have heard, SO is not a code writing service.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to SO. I'm sorry, but this is not a good question and will likely be closed very soon unless you edit it with an example of what you have already tried.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you checked out the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python docs</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MadPhysicist I get this every time &gt;_&lt; I coudn't do it myslef, because i'm not that good at python, so i tried everything i knew. I then searched it, discovering new things, but still leaving it unsolved. After sarching for a while, i decided to ask a new question. Contrary to what you may have heard, not everyone knows everything</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Gee, do you think maybe you "get this every time" because on this website <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">it is expected that you PROVIDE CODE EXAMPLES of what you have tried,</a> even if they don't work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much, the other people were saying ""do not do this", ignoring it completely, while a simple answer could be more useful <b>Thank you!</b></span>
