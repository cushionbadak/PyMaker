<p>Does the error message mean something to anyone?

<p>This issue seems to be related with the setuptools version installed in your virtualenv. Downgrading to an older version fixed it for me.</p>
<p>From your virtualenv:</p>
<pre><code>pip install setuptools==21.2.1
pip install flask
</code></pre>

<p>I had this problem yesterday.  I resolved it by downloading the MarkupSafe <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/" rel="noreferrer">wheel</a> and installing with pip.  The problem was way over my head.  Something about compiler flags in order to suppress an error when generating the Speedups file, I think.</p>
<p>1) Download the wheel from the link above.</p>
<p>2) On Windows, open a command window in the same directory as the wheel.</p>
<p>3) run "pip Install "</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The setup.py of MarkupSafe is broken for Win7 on my system where there is no C compiler. (I keep a separate VM for VC++ work) I did this to get it working:</p>
<pre><code>pip download MarkupSafe 
mkdir temp 
open MarkupSafe-0.23.tar.gz with 7-zip, extract all to temp 
cd temp 
edit setup.py line 119 to read: if 0: #not (is_pypy or is_jython): 
python setup.py install
</code></pre>
<p>I did not try to debug setup.py to work correctly. I just wanted to try out Flask since it's supposed to be lightweight and easy to learn, and the official docs say it installs on Windows. Maybe I should go back to Perl...</p>
<p>Unlike the other poster, a global pip install of MarkupSafe didn't work for me either.</p>

<p>ok. I figure it out.  I don't think there is anything wrong in the way I install flask, as I already mentioned in my question, I am able to install it globally (without running within a virtualenv). 
the MarkupSafe package has an extension which is implement using c, and I don't have windows sdk installed on my local machine, so when ve_build_ext runs, 
****  it always fail  ** </p>
<p>the difference is if not (is_pypy or is_jython) , it gives a warning, which is what i got when installing it globally; it crashes, though, when running under a virtualenv. So I'm pretty sure that hasattr(sys, 'pypy_version_info') return true when running under a virtualenv.</p>
<p>Does anybody have an idea what "hasattr(sys, 'pypy_version_info')" mean??</p>

<p>I had this issue today and was able to resolve it by manually installing <a href="http://www.pocoo.org/projects/markupsafe" rel="nofollow">MarkupSafe</a> from a <a href="http://pythonwheels.com" rel="nofollow">wheel</a> file, per Lincoln's suggestion above. You can download the appropriate file <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#markupsafe" rel="nofollow">here</a>. There were several available. I don't know what the difference between all of them is, but the only one that would even install on Windows 10 was the one called <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/6kbpejrn/MarkupSafe-0.23-cp27-none-win32.whl" rel="nofollow">MarkupSafe-0.23-cp27-none-win32.whl</a>. After downloading it, I copied it into the directory I created using virtualenv (not sure if that's necessary but that's what I did) and installed it with pip:</p>
<pre><code>C:\flask-test\venv&gt;pip install MarkupSafe-0.23-cp27-none-win32.whl
</code></pre>
<p>from that directory. After that I went back to the main directory and installed Flask</p>
<pre><code>C:\flask-test\venv&gt;cd ..
C:\flask-test&gt;pip install Flask
</code></pre>
<p>and it worked fine.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks. but I'm able to install it globally without using visual studio.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what really confuses me is why it doesn't work under a virtualenv, while it works perfectly when installing globally?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This also worked flawlessly for me, this error seems to be some syntax issue way over my head.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This same fix also worked for me when seeing a similar error while installing Sphinx.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This worked for me as well. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you please gives some more detail on exactly what steps you took to do that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was trying to install Jupyter Notebook on Windows and MarkupSafe is a dependency. This error regarding MarkupSafe is what popped up when I used <code>pip</code> to install Jupyter Notebook.  I searched here for a similar problem and this was the only solution that worked for me.  I had to download the wheel created by Christoph Gohlke, use <code>pip</code> to manually install it and I was then able to install Jupyter Notebook successfully.  Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thankyou, this solved my issue after a bunch of various different attempts - I even tried installing various VC++ versions, but without success.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I got a compiled version of markupsafe from <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs</a>   and install it locally under virtualenv. After that I am able to install flask in my virtualenv</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was running under git bash.  just figured out how to run it in interaction mode  simply type: $python -i</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should add a link to the wheel repository into this answer and accept it so that others can see what the solution is. And, thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>sys.pypy_version_info</code> would be set if you were using PyPy instead of CPython. You'd know if you were using the PyPy interpreter.</span>
