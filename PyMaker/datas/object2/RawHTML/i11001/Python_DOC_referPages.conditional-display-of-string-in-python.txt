<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a program for enumerating the users with administrative privileges on Windows. I also want to display the number of accounts found which is stored in a variable called <code>num_administrator</code>.
I have the following piece of code:</p>
<pre><code>if num_administrators &gt; 1:
    print("[*] {} accounts with administrative privileges found:\n".format(num_administrators))
    show_admins()
elif num_administrators == 1:
    print("[*] {} account with administrative privileges found:\n".format(num_administrators))
    show_admins()
else:
    print("[*] No accounts with administrative privileges found.\n")
</code></pre>
<p>If there aren't admins I would like to print <code>[*] No accounts with administrative privileges found.</code>
If there is 1 or more admins the message to display is almost the same, the only difference is the display of <code>account</code> or <code>accounts</code> according to the number. It's only a matter of 1 letter (<code>s</code>).
Can I achieve the conditional print just by using a unique statement or anyway in a simpler way?
Is it possible to print something like: </p>
<pre><code>print("[*] {} account".format(num_administrators) + if num_administrators &gt; 1 "s" + "with administrative privileges found:\n")
</code></pre>
<p>Don't mind my code above, I don't know the syntax if what I'm doing makes sense, it's just to give you an idea of what I'm thinking and you can tell me if it's doable or not.</p>
<p>Besides I'm calling the function <code>show_admins()</code> 3 times (for printing the admin accounts) but actually I can call it just once at the end I guess.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here's a crafty one-liner I made:</p>
<pre><code>"[*] {} account{} with administrative privileges found.\n".format("No" if num_administrators == 0 else str(num_administrators), "s" if num_administrators != 1 else "")
</code></pre>
<p>P.S. As for readability, I don't know... I maybe be wrong, but I think my eyes are bleeding</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to go with one line solution, that's already been answered here. However, I'd recommend using if/else statements because that way, the solution is more readable:</p>
<pre><code>output = "[*] "

if num_administrators &gt; 1:
    output += "{} accounts ".format(num_administrators)
elif num_administrators == 1:
    output += "1 account "
else:
    output += "No accounts "

output += "with administrative privileges found:\n"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do something like</p>
<pre><code> if num_administrators &gt; 1:
       print "The total number of administrators is %d"%(num_administrators)
</code></pre>
<p>or, if you want it to be a string:</p>
<pre><code> if num_administrators &gt; 1:
       print "The total number of administrators is %s"%(str(num_administrators))
</code></pre>
<p>So here the simplest way is to use lambda:</p>
<pre><code>l = lambda x:'No' if x == 0 else x
print("[*] {} accounts with adminstrative priveleges".format(l(num_admin)))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I took a look at <em>dmitryro</em>'s solution and I like the use of <strong>lambda</strong> for displaying different strings according to a condition. I also would like to take into account the case of <code>num_admin == 1</code> though. I edited the code and I got this:</p>
<pre><code>l = lambda x:"No accounts" if x == 0 else ("accounts" if x &gt; 1 else "account")
</code></pre>
<p>Then I edited a bit also the print statement:</p>
<pre><code>print("[*] {} {} with administrative privileges found".format(num_admin, l(num_admin)))
</code></pre>
<p>I had to add another placeholder <code>{}</code> for displaying the number and I added another parameter <code>num_admin</code> in the <code>format()</code> function.</p>
<p>Now It's almost perfect but there is still a problem:</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>for <code>num_admin = 1</code> I get: <code>[*] 1 account with administrative privileges found</code></p>
<p>for <code>num_admin == 2</code> I get: <code>[*] 2 accounts with administrative privileges found</code></p>
<p>but for <code>num_admin == 0</code> I get: <code>[*] 0 No accounts with administrative privileges found</code></p>
<p>I would like to avoid the display of the number <code>0</code> in front of the sentence, anyway I think I'm complicating my life and it'd be still acceptable. Besides I should consider readability as an important aspect.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I took a look at <em>On a Friday</em>'s answer again and it actually addresses this problem:</p>
<p>I think in fact </p>
<p><code>print("[*] {} account{} with administrative privileges found.\n".format("No" if num_administrators == 0 else str(num_administrators), "s" if num_administrators != 1 else ""))</code> </p>
<p>seems a perfect one-liner, although I agree readability might be an issue. It certainly doesn't adhere to <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow"><strong>PEP 8</strong>:</a> <code>line too long (175 &gt; 79 characters).</code></p>
<p>I also like this solution because it avoids using lambda and uses <strong>conditional expressions</strong>, I think it's simpler.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just move your indents 4 spaces backward - your elif and else never hold as they're within if.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@dmitryro If that was the case he'd get a <code>SyntaxError</code>. you cannot have an <code>elif</code> without <code>if</code>. Probably just a copy&amp;paste error.</span>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>ngettext</code> was designed for exactly this purpose.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are right, the code wasn't indented well here on Stack Overflow, but it was fine on my computer. I edited the question. Can you have a look at the question again and see what I'm asking? @dmitryro</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please never do this ;-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it certainly doesn't adhere to PEP 8: line too long (175 &gt; 79 characters) but I love this one-liner :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Personally I would first do the if/else first and then do the formatting via format e.g. <code>"[*] {} with administrative privileges found:\n".format(account_string)</code>. That way it is easier to extend the message.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are right, this is a way to avoid the problem all together. I'd still be interested in seeing a more elegant way to achieve exactly what I asked though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Probably lambda returning you No or the number is the simplest way to do it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I like your solution with lambda because it is concise and still readable. There is also another similar way I found using conditional statements. I'd like to take into account also the case num_admin == 1</span>
