<p>When this is ran you get an error at  board[guess_row][guess_col] = "X" so the question is how do I insert the string X at those two indexes?</p>

<p><code>board</code> is a list of five 5-character strings. You are trying to assign to a specific character in an existing string, i.e. to <em>mutate</em> a string object. This is not possible, because strings in Python are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable" rel="nofollow">immutable</a> (the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" rel="nofollow">Tutorial</a> also mentions this).</p>

<p>You can, however, organize <code>board</code> as a list of lists of characters, in which case your assignment will work.</p>
