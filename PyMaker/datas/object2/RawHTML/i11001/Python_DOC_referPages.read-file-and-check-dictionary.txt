<p>I want to read a file line by line and check for each line whether one string of the line is allowed by my dictionary to be with another string in the same line. I have come up with this code </p>
<pre><code>dic={'ALA':['N','H','CA','HA','CB','HB1','HB2','HB3','C','O'],
'GLY':['N','H','CA','HA2','HA3','C','O'],
(...)
}

fin=open('file.pdb','r')

for line in fin:
    atom=line[12:16].strip()
    resi=line[17:20].strip()
    if atom not in dic[resi]:
        print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>But it gives me:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
File "names.py", line 38, in &lt;module&gt;
if atom not in dic[resi]:
KeyError: '3.2'
</code></pre>
<p>So this is not working. Strangely replacing dic[resi] to something like dic['ALA'] works just fine. What am I doing wrong here?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is you're getting the value of <code>3.2</code> for <code>resi</code> for one of the lines and since <code>3.2</code> is not a valid key in dic, you're getting an exception.</p>
<pre><code>for line in fin:
    atom=line[12:16].strip()
    resi=line[17:20].strip()
    if resi in dic and atom not in dic[resi]:
        print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<pre><code>for line in fin:
    atom=line[12:16].strip()
    resi=line[17:20].strip()
    if resi in dic.keys() and atom not in dic[resi]:
        print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>The first method using the <code>n</code> keyword is the best way to know the existence of a key in a dictionary. It runs in O(1)(uses hashing) while the second method does a linear search after getting the keys of the dictionary.</p>
<p>In both the methods, since short-circuiting is used, if the first condition fails, the second condition would never get evaluated. Alternatively you can rescue the exception using <code>try..except</code> block.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It says Keyerror when you use dic[resi] because 'resi' is not a key in the dic but 'ALA'  is a key in your dictionary. If you try something like print (dic['ALA']) it will print everything under the 'ALA' key. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't have a key named '3.2' in <code>dic</code>. I think you should check the key name first.</p>
<pre><code>for line in fin:
    atom=line[12:16].strip()
    resi=line[17:20].strip()
    result = dic.get(resi)
    if result and (atom not in result):
        print(line)

<span class="comment-copy">give us snippet of <code>file.pdb</code>, even somehting like 2-3 lines will suffice</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Clearly, whatever is being read at <code>line[17:20].strip()</code> is 3.2, which isn't a residue. It's impossible to tell without seeing the nature of the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It just tells you that there's no key with the name <code>3.2</code> in <code>dic</code>. Maybe your slicing gives wrogn results</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Amazing! I was not aware that my file header had some lines in the beginning which are different. Thanks a lot =)</span>
