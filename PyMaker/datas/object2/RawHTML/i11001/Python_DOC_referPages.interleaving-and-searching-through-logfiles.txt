<p>I have multiple GB of logfiles which I want to search through. Every log has a timestamp, message and additional multiple fields, so each log consists of multiple lines looking like this:</p>
<pre><code>Mon Jan 20 12:00:00 2016 127.0.0.1:12345 Hello World!
Field_1 = foo
Field_2 = bar
... (some more fields)
&lt;empty line&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this way two logs are separated by a single empty line. Unfortunately only single logfiles are ordered by time, two different logfiles must be interleaved to get the whole ordered line of logs. This is the first thing I want to achieve.</p>
<p>Further I want to search on logs. This basically means that I want to define search terms and grep on each single log. All search terms need to match. So in the end I want have an ordered set of logs which meet my search terms.</p>
<p>I tried to get through this by using the context search of grep but the missing order by time and the fixed context size made it a pain. So I want to ask if there is some Bash or Python magic to let this happen. Every hint is highly appreciated!</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend that you would look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">regular expressions</a>
, they have all the things you need! You could make a script that compiles the regex template and then use <code>re.findall(regex_template, your_log_variable)</code> &lt; Just an example, you have to fill in your own logs and templates.</p>
<p>Hope this helps you...</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@dmitryro Thank you for the link. In fact I was not aware of awk! Together with <a href="http://www.thinkplexx.com/learn/article/webperf/baslog/statwithbashandawk" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> I will try to get something running.</span>
