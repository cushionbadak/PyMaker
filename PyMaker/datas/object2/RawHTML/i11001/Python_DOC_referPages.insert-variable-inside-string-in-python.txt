<p>I'm new to python and I was wondering how to put a variable inside a string to show the contents of such variable in an LCD 20x4 display (2004A).</p>
<p>The code I have looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>with open("temperature.txt") as myfile:
currenttemp=myfile.readlines()

lcd_string("%(currenttemp)" ,LCD_LINE_1,2)
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this prints <code>"%(currenttemp)"</code> in the LCD display, and not the currenttemp variable value.</p>

<p>An example of string formatting in Python:</p>
<p><strong>Code:</strong></p>
<pre><code>a = "one line file"
print("this file contains: %s" %a)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>this file contains: one line file
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">In particular look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string formatting</a>. Also, your <code>currenttemp</code> right now by using <code>readlines</code> is going to be a list of lines from your file. So, you also want to make sure what exactly it is you want your <code>currenttemp</code> to actually be.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">currenttemp is always a 1 line file, so that wouldn't be a problem. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ramirous It would still be in a list. So if you had just 'foo' in your file, by using <code>readlines</code> you will have <code>['foo']</code>. And if you then put it in a string as is you will end up printing <code>['foo']</code>. You might want to look at <code>read()</code> and possibly look at removing any unwanted white space using <code>strip</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If the file has new line in the end then: currenttemp=myfile.readlines()[0][:-1] otherwise: currenttemp=myfile.readlines()[0]</span>
