<p>I'm building a Kivy application for Android. When it is run on my Linux machine from terminal it works as expected. When it is built and deployed to Android it fails with the following error:</p>
<pre><code>I/python  (14091):  Traceback (most recent call last):
I/python  (14091):    File "{project path}/src/app/.buildozer/android/app/main.py", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
I/python  (14091):    File "{project path}/src/app/.buildozer/android/app/_app.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
I/python  (14091):  ImportError: No module named app.ui.first_screen
I/python  (14091): Python for android ended.
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>first_screen.py</code> (and the accompanying <code>first_screen.kv</code>) does exist in the <code>ui</code> package, but it appears the import path is different from what I am expecting. How do I need to structure my imports to properly load on Android?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try to add the path to your module to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path" rel="nofollow">sys.path</a>.</p>
<p>But maybe... there's no such thing as <code>app.ui.first_screen</code>. Try to make it only <code>ui.first_screen</code> or go for this:</p>
<pre><code>from .&lt;file/folder in your app folder&gt; import &lt;something&gt;
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">since this would use relative imports, it will currently cause a different error on Android. I reported the issue (<a href="https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android/issues/840" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/kivy/python-for-android/issues/840</a>) on the project's bug tracker already, although there seems to be general strangeness with importing on Android.</span>
