<p>In Python, Can I generate a geometric progression using list comprehensions alone? I don't get how to refer to elements that were added to the list. </p>
<p>That would be like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18800804/writing-python-code-to-calculate-a-geometric-progression">Writing python code to calculate a Geometric progression</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31225617/generate-list-geometric-progression">Generate list - geometric progression</a>.</p>

<p>List comprehensions don't let you refer to previous values. You could get around this by using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.accumulate" rel="nofollow">more appropriate tool</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import accumulate
from operator import mul
length = 10
ratio = 2
progression = list(accumulate([ratio]*length, mul))
</code></pre>
<p>or by avoiding the use of previous values:</p>
<pre><code>progression = [start * ratio**i for i in range(n)]
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If a geometric progression is defined by <code>a_n = a * r ** (n - 1)</code> and <code>a_n = r * a_(n - 1)</code>, then you could just do the following:</p>
<pre><code>a = 2
r = 5
length = 10

geometric = [a * r ** (n - 1) for n in range(1, length + 1)]

print(geometric)
# [2, 10, 50, 250, 1250, 6250, 31250, 156250, 781250, 3906250]
</code></pre>
