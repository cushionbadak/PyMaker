<p>I have programmed in C++ earlier but I am new to Python. I searched for this but i was not able to find the appropriate answer. In C++, I can do:</p>
<pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;10;i++)
{
   i+=5;
   std::cout&lt;&lt;i&lt;&lt;std::endl
}
</code></pre>
<p>The values of i would be 5 and 11. But in python if i do:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(0,10):
   i+=5
   print i
</code></pre>
<p>The value of i does update for that iteration of loop, but in the next iteration, it will become 1.
While I do understand that in python, after each iteration, i will contain the next value in the tuple/list generated by range, but is there any way I can make it skip iterations like in C++? I really don`t want to use the next() function 5 times</p>
<p>EDIT: I can use the third parameter of range function for general use, but what if I want to skip some iterations for say if only a certain condition is true. eg</p>
<pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;10;i++)
{
   if(i%2)i+=1;
   std::cout&lt;&lt;i&lt;&lt;std::endl
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to skip iterations when a condition is true, then use <code>continue</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    if i % 2:
        continue
    print(i)
</code></pre>

<p>I know what you were thinking, but there's something built-in for python that allows you to set the iteration step within the <code>range()</code> function. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here</a> is the official Python Documentation on <code>range()</code>.</p>
<p>In essence, to skip <code>x</code> after each iteration, you would do:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(start, stop, x + 1):
    # functions and stuff
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helped.</p>

<p>You can use a regular <code>while</code> loop. it will look less nice but it does the job.
for example:</p>
<pre><code>i = 0
while i &lt; 100:
    print i
    if i % 2 == 0:
        i += 5
    i+=1
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">you might want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#range" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>range</code></a> third parameter which specify the step size. If that doesn't suit you, consider a regular <code>while</code> loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The best way to do this in Python will depend on why you want to skip 5 iterations.  You wouldn't really write code like your C++ example.  Sometimes toy simplifications obscure the real topic.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The question is not really about using continue as a solution. It's about altering the loop iteration based on an if condition. <code>if (someCondition) {change the value of i to something else}</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Nav the question says, "what if I want to skip some iterations"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But, it ain't generic. It'll work only when you have a constant skip. What if you have to skip multiples of 3 as well as 2?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hashcode55 That's the drawback for using the built-in. See Ned Batchelder's solution for a case-sensitive way of solving the problem.</span>
