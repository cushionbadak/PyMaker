<p>I have a folder structure like this:</p>
<pre><code>setup.py
core/
    __init__.py
    interpreter.py
tests/
    __init__.py
    test_ingest.py
</code></pre>
<p>If I try to import <code>core</code> in <code>test_ingest.py</code> and run it, I get an <code>ImportError</code> saying that the <code>core</code> module can't be found. However, I can import <code>core</code> in <code>setup.py</code> without an issue. My IDE doesn't freak out, so why is this error occurring? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you <code>import</code> your package, Python searches the directories on <code>sys.path</code> until it finds one of these: a file called "core.py", or a directory called "core" containing a file called <code>__init__.py</code>. Python then <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow">imports</a> your <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-package" rel="nofollow">package</a>.</p>
<p>You are able to successfully <code>import core</code> from <code>setup.py</code> because the path to the <code>core</code> directory is found in <code>sys.path</code>.  You can see this yourself by running this snippet from your file:</p>
<pre><code>import sys

for line in sys.path:
     print line
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to import <code>core</code> from a different file in your folder structure, you can append the path to the directory where <code>core</code> is found to <code>sys.path</code> in your file:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.append("/path/to/your/module")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I've seen this solution quite frequently; in <code>test_ingest.py</code>, I have <code>sys.path.append("/Users/apizzimenti/Desktop/simple-engine-core/core")</code>. After this, I run <code>import core</code>, and an ImportError still follows. If I print the lines in <code>sys.path</code> after appending the path to the module, the path appears there. Even so, I get an ImportError.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You want <code>sys.path.append("/Users/apizzimenti/Desktop/simple-engine-core/")</code> instead.  You want to append the path to the directory in which <code>core</code> is found, not the path to the module itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That works. Thank you! Now, for me to import <code>core</code> into other files in the <code>tests</code> module, do I have to append that path in every file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My pleasure!  You could do that if you wanted to; alternatively, you could add the path to your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable.  Check out this question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7472436/">stackoverflow.com/questions/7472436</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am on a mac and that answer mainly pertains to windows, but I added the path to the PYTHONPATH env variable and it all works out. Thank you for your help :) you are a gentleman and a scholar.</span>
