<p>What is the most efficient or most readable or shortest way to generate a timestamp in a range on timestamps. Basically a function that will return a timestamp.</p>
<p>Lets say timestamp has to be later than <code>1999-04-01T07:00:00Z</code> and earlier than <code>2016-06-03T15:18:07Z</code> in this exact format. </p>
<p>This timestamp will be then used as a url param to GET some entities created either earlier or later than this. Also, is this some certain standard of a format? Does it have name? </p>

<p>It seems that you need a <em>string</em> of a certain format.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ISO_8601</a>. You can use <code>.isoformat()</code> from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> to get exactly that.</p>

<p>Shortest and most efficient way would be to simply return <code>"1999-04-01T07:00:01Z"</code>, for example. Technically, that does the job.</p>
<p>However, I suppose you need something more, like returning a random new one each time or incrementing date with some step or whatnot.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Instantiate <code>datetime</code> objects, subtract them to get a <code>timedelta</code>, generate a random number between <code>0</code> and the seconds in the <code>timedelta</code>, add <code>timedelta(seconds=my_random_number)</code> to your smaller timestamp.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Ahh, thanks for the ISO_8601 reference. Still, I wanted to see what the best way to generate random values in this range. I will the use this in a performance test for an API that gets documents from solr based on when documents were created.</span>
