I'm a newbie to the Python world. I was hoping someone might point me in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>My current setup</strong></p>
<p>I am running on Ubuntu 14.04 which already had python 2.7 and 3.4 installed.
I've downloaded Python 3.5.1 and executed <code>./Configure</code>, <code>make</code>, <code>make install</code> and installation seems fine.
I've also installed pip3 <code>sudo apt-get install python3-pip</code></p>
<p><strong>My problem</strong></p>
<p>pip3 installs my new libraries for Python 3.4, not Python 3.5. </p>
<p><strong>Looking at a solution</strong></p>
<p>As per the other post, I've executed the following:</p>
<p><code>$ python3.4 -m pip --version
pip 1.5.4 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (python 3.4)
$ python3.5 -m pip --version
/usr/local/bin/python3.5: No module named pip</code></p>
<p>The other post also mentions that it could be a bug and that I could 'run pip through python' which I have no idea how to do. </p>
<p>Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install python3-pip</code> can only ever install <code>pip</code> into the system-provided Python version.</p>
<p>You'll need to get pip for Python 3.5. Python 3.5 comes with a module for this, called <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ensurepip</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>sudo python3.5 -m ensurepip
</code></pre>
<p>This will locate and install pip for that specific Python installation.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Wow Thanks man. Getting another error with this: Ignoring ensurepip failure: pip 7.1.2 requires SSL/TLS. Any thoughts?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StevePaul: you installed Python without SSL support. Install the OpenSSL development headers and re-build (configure, make) and re-install Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StevePaul: see <a href="http://serverfault.com/q/353128">Recompiling python with SSL support on ubuntu</a> for example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StevePaul: you may be missing other features, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/22934227">ImportError after upgrading python 2.7.3 to 2.7.6</a> for a list of development packages I think is still up-to-date for Python 3.5 and Ubuntu.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This helped a great deal - thank you! Now I can execute pip3.5 commands. Awesome stuff.</span>
