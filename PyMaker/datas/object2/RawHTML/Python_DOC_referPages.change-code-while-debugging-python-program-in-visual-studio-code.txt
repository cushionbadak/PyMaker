<p>Is it possible to change the code while debugging in VSCode and that the change will take effect immediately without rerun the code?
I'm using Microsoft Python extension.</p>

<p>It depends. There's no such thing as a hot reload in Python. The closest you can come is <code>importlib.reload()</code>, but realize that only reloads the module and not the objects which already exist in memory. IOW it typically doesn't do what you want in code (it's usually used in the REPL).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't think that's possible in any language.  You can change code while a program is running, but you still have to re-run the code to see the change.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In vba it's possible.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Adirmola But generally not in other languages.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Too bad. I really don't understand why not, it's a big advantage in debugging.</span>
