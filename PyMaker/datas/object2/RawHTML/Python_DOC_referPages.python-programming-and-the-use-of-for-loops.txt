<p>Am new to programming and I just started studying and practicing. I started with python and am at for loops now. I kinda coded something that‚Äôs getting confusing for me because I can‚Äôt seem to understand how the code arrived at that output. Can someone please explain it to me. Would be very grateful.
Here‚Äôs the code I did:</p>
<pre><code>a = range(1,20) 
total = 0 
for i in a : 
    if i%3==0 or i%5==0 : 
        total new = total + i 
print (total new) 
</code></pre>
<p>And the output was 18.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>a = range(1,20) 
</code></pre>
<p>Your program is creating a range of numbers between 1 and 19 (ranges go to one less than the max number you specify) like <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 19]</code></p>
<pre><code>total = 0
</code></pre>
<p>Your program is initializing the variable <code>total</code> to equal 0</p>
<pre><code>for i in a:
</code></pre>
<p>You start looping through the range you made earlier, the first iteration <code>i=1</code>, the next <code>i=2</code> and so on until <code>i=19</code></p>
<pre><code>if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
</code></pre>
<p>You are selecting only the data where the modulo of 5 or 3 is 0. For example: </p>
<pre><code>3 % 3 == 0 (0 remainder)
4 % 3 == 1 (1 remainder)
</code></pre>
<p>Now altering your variable to a reasonable name (without spaces) <strong>that will actually utilize the variable we initialized above</strong></p>
<pre><code>total = total + i # alternatively written "total += i"
</code></pre>
<p>This says that every time the value <code>i</code> is evenly divisible by 3 or 5 we will add it to our total</p>
<pre><code>print(total)
</code></pre>
<p>We show the final result after adding values. You incorrectly scripted your program to do this though so it only showed the largest value that was evenly divisible by 5 or 3 which is 18.</p>
<p>When scripted correctly:</p>
<pre><code>a = range(1, 20)
total = 0
for i in a:
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
        total += i
print(total)
</code></pre>
<p>Outputs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>78</p>
</blockquote>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>total new</code>?? Your variables should <b>not</b> have any spaces in them!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because, 0 + 18 = 18. (Assuming <code>total new</code> is a typo you made here). Result variable holds only the value computed during the last iteration; all others are overridden.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your total will always be 0. This means total new(which cant contain space) will end up to be total new = 0+18.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks very much. Exactly the understanding I needed!üëçüèæ</span>
