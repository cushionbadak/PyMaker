<p>I have a random function like this:</p>
<pre><code>def rand_int(a, b):
    res = random.random()
    diff = b - a
    res = a + (diff * res)
    return int(res) 
</code></pre>
<p>With this I can get a random number between a and b.</p>
<p>Now I want a random number between a and b that is a multiple of 5 like this:</p>
<p><code>rand_int(12,100)</code> output should be one of: 15, 20, 25, 30 ... 85, 90, 95, 100</p>
</div>

<p>::EDIT::
the question was re-phrased making my original answer wrong.</p>
<p>To get a random number between 12 and 100 but with an output rounded to the nearest 5. Note that <code>round(12/5)*5</code> is equal to 10. The original post listed "15" as the first example output. </p>
<pre><code>def randInt(a, b):
    return 5*round(random.randint(12,100)/5)

<p>This should work:</p>
<pre><code>a,b = 11, 27
k = 5

import random
from math import floor, ceil

random.randrange(k*ceil(a/k),k + (k*floor(b/k)),k) for i in range(c)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Test this by generating 100 numbers with the above expression:</strong></p>
<pre><code>l = [random.randrange(k*ceil(a/k),k + (k*floor(b/k)),k) for i in range(100)]
print (l)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried? What specifically do you need help with?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not use <code>random.randrange()</code>? That is functionally equivalent to your <code>rand_int</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You Don't Need To Capitalise Every Word. It makes your requirement harder to read, but also I'm not clear on the expected output here. What values should be multiplied by 5?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46454170/fastest-way-to-generate-random-number-from-uniform-distribtution-python">this post</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hossein Post all code in the question, formatted as I did with your other code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What if a is larger than b?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think this would work but im sure there are better ways. <code>return random.randint(min(a,b),max(a,b))*5</code> This also doesn't account for a/b being a float.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For a binary choice, I can't think of a better way tbh</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@J'e no I have this rand_int(12, 100) and outcome should like this :: 15,20, 25,40,50,65,....</span>
