<p>So for some reason, my computer refuses to see the environment PATH variable. In the path variable, I have:</p>
<p>C:\Python32;</p>
<p>listed, along with all of the other programs, but it doesn't work if I type, "python" into the command window. However, I can type "python" into the run window, and have it run the correct interpreter (I assume because I have an environment variable for that separately...? As you can see, I don't quite understand how to customize this stuff. Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>I know it's been a while, but I hope this could help someone else.</p>
<p>I had the same problem and the only way to making it work was running cmd or powershell as administrator.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can confirm if python is in your environment variables by looking at the output of echo</p>
<pre><code>%path%
</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that after editing the PATH variable using the control panel, you have to <strong>open a new terminal</strong>, as the setting will NOT be updated in existing terminals.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that you added the wrong path to the PATH variable. Verify it.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, if the directory of your python.exe is really in PATH, then running python will really work.</p>

<p>I faced the same problem.
Add more specific folders to your path.
For example I added this and it seemed to work out! :)</p>
<pre><code>C:\Python35-32;C:\Python35-32\Lib\site-packages\;C:\Python35-32\Scripts\;
</code></pre>
<p>To check if it is set successfully, type python in command prompt</p>

<p>I faced the same issue. </p>
<p>However, in my case, I went through the documentation from python and found where I was making mistake. In the latest python versions, if you type 'python' in cmd, it will show error. 
At the same time, the command that worked for me was 'py'.</p>
<p>So I recommend anyone facing a similar problem to try this - 'py'</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Tried both your and lc's ideas, but it didn't work. I have the Python path listed in my environment PATH list, but typing 'python' into the command window doesn't work. I guess the real question is, "How would I configure my path variables so that I could type 'python' into a command window and start up my Python installation present in C:\Python32?"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that if you're using Windows 7, you have to add a step. After clicking "Properties", click the "Advance System Settings" link on the left of the window. Then you can go to the "Advanced" tab and continue from there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tried it, but it didn't work. :( Thanks for the effort though. EDIT: By 'It', I mean that I tried 'set PYTHONPATH = %PYTHONPATH%; C:\Python32', but calling the 'python' command still didn't work. Any other ideas? Or possibly a more precise place to point me?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please have a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50896577/">this answer</a>: <code>py</code> is the <i>Python launcher</i> which is a utility that comes with Python installations on Windows. So, <code>python</code> and <code>py</code> are two different things. You should <i>always</i> be able to launch <code>python</code> if you have it on <code>%PATH%</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That was a very useful answer. So, is it safe to assume that we can use 'py' also in the same way as python. I mean, can we perform everything using the launcher also?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The launcher can be seen as an enhancement. So, it is able to do things a bare bone Python does not, such as choosing a python version If you have several versions installed or virtual commands from shebang lines. Basic info <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>, detailed info <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. Since the python launcher is an optional component, I would not recommend to rely on it.</span>
