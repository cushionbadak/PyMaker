<p>I'm a freshman in college, who's taking a python coding class. Currently I'm working on making a program count the amount of vowels or consonants based on a user's input to determine the mode.</p>
<p>currently, I've made two lists, and I'm trying to find out how to program python to count the vowels/consonants.</p>
<p>This is what I have so far - please keep in mind, I've worked on both ends, and the center is where the counting goes.</p>

print("Welcome to the V/C Counter!")

#Make List
vowels = list("aeiouy")
consonants = list("bcdfghjklmnpqrstvexz")

complete = False
while complete == False:
    mode = input("What mode would you like? Vowels or Consonants?: ").lower().strip()
    print("")
    print("You chose the mode: " + str(mode))
    print("")
    if mode == "vowels":
        word = input("Please input a word: ")
        print("your word was: " + str(word))
        print("")



        choice = input("Are you done, Y/N: ").lower().strip()
        if choice == "y":
            complete = True
        else:
            print("Ok, back to the top!")
    elif mode == "consonants":
        word = input("please input a word: ")
        print("your word was: " + str(word))
        print("")


        choice = input("Are you done, Y/N: ").lower().strip()
        if choice == "y":
            complete = True
        else:
            print("Ok, back to the top!")

<p>Using regex would be an alternative:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall('[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]','there wont be any wovels in the result') 
['t', 'h', 'r', 'n', 't', 'b', 'n', 'v', 'l', 's', 'n', 't', 'h', 'r', 's', 'l', 't']

<p>If you take its length your problem is solved.</p>
<pre><code>text = 'some text'

wovels = 'aeiou'
consonants = 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz'

from re import findall
wovelCount = len(findall('[%s]' % wovels, text))

<p>This is a solution which counts consonants and vowels, while excluding punctuation explicitly.</p>

<p>Most other answers seem to count each character separately and then sum up the results, which means the code has to iterate over the input string many times and is somewhat inefficient. More efficient would be to count all occurences of all characters in one go, using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import collections

s = "This is an example sentence."

counter = collections.Counter(s)

consonants = 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ'
num_consonants = sum(counter[char] for char in consonants)
# result: 14

vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
num_vowels = sum(counter[char] for char in vowels)
# result: 9

<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, no one cares about the bookends. Only the function that does the work matters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">None of the code you've pasted pertains to counting characters. What have you tried, and where are you stuck?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is <code>e</code> a consonant?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I removed it because nothing was working. (Hence where I said the big chunk spaces were where the good would go.)  What I was doing before is making using similar questions I found on google such as the .count() method, but from what I found, the particular set-up was not working.  I found one of the answers that makes more sense that I'm to test.  Thank you for the help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, slight typo.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is better than my solution using filter()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A small change will make your solution a bit faster. Instead of generator use the exact list sum([word.count(c) for c in consonants]). You can afford to do that as the list is not too big.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@spicavigo - are you sure the list solution is faster? With consonants and "hello world" it is 17% slower. But with consonants and <code>string.letters * 1000</code> it is about the same speed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think mine would bite yours :), regex rocks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>sum(1 for c in vowels)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good and concise solution, but a novice in Python probably will not understand it.  It would be nice to add a few sentences explaining the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">^ Exactly, but references non the less are always a good thing! I've actually found some "lambda" things from other similar questions, and was actually reading up on the documentation of it. Non the less, thank you for all of the help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aran-Fey, yep was still editing - also added trivial vowels solution. Thks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What if I add 'y' in both 'vowels' and 'consonants'? ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">then do not use elif, use if and you will get y counted in both nv or nc. But why you want to do that? In any case the OP seems to consider y as a vowel.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when including a code block you will want to either include comments explaining your code or some exposition around your code block explaining your solution.  Thanks!</span>
