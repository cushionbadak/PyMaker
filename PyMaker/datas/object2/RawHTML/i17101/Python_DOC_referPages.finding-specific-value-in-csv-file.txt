<p>So I have a function that finds the maximum value in a column in a csv file. I want to print the value thats on the same row as the max value, but in column 13. The code makes it clearer:</p>
<pre><code>def bigQuake(inputfilename):

    file = open(inputfilename,"r")
    maxvalue = 0.0
    for line in file:
        value = line.split()
        try:
            p = float(line.split(",")[4])
            maxvalue = max(maxvalue,p)
        except:
            pass
return maxvalue
</code></pre>
<p>The code above simply finds the maxvalue of column 4, what's not working is when I replace</p>
<pre><code>return maxvalue
</code></pre>
<p>with</p>
<pre><code>print("The largest earthquake was a " + maxvalue + "magnitude earthquake" + value[12])
</code></pre>
<p>value[12] is trying to find the value in column 12 that corresponds to the max value of column 4. Note that column 12 contains strings, so I want the output to  look like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;bigQuake(file.csv)
&gt;&gt;&gt;The largest earthquake was a 50 magnitude earthquake 10km from San Francisco.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Track the value of magnitude corresponding to the maximum value in the 4th column.</p>
<p>Also better use <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv</a> module from standard library for parsing csv files:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

def bigQuake(inputfilename):
    with open(inputfilename,"r") as input_file:
        reader = csv.reader(input_file)

        maxvalue = 0.0
        magnitude = None
        for line in reader:
            try:
                p = float(line[4])
                if p &gt; maxvalue:
                    maxvalue = p
                    magnitude = line[12]
            except ValueError:
                pass

    print("The largest earthquake was a", maxvalue, "magnitude earthquake", magnitude, ".")
</code></pre>
<p>Also, note that you should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with" rel="nofollow noreferrer">with</a> context manager while working with files and catch only <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14797375/should-we-always-specify-an-exception-type-in-python">specific to situation exceptions</a>.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you please <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/22752808/edit">edit</a> this to correctly format your code? As it's written this doesn't even run. Also: what's your actual question? What's not working?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>def bigQuake...</code> should be in the code block.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This looks trivial with the <code>pandas</code> library.  See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10202570/pandas-dataframe-find-row-where-values-for-column-is-maximal" title="pandas dataframe find row where values for column is maximal">stackoverflow.com/questions/10202570/â€¦</a> ; You'd need to use <code>df = pandas.read_csv(fname) </code> to get the data into a pandas data frame.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">code fixed, my apologies</span>
