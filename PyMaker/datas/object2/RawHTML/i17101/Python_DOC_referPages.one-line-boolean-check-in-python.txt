<p>I am a relatively newer Python developer, but I come from a Java background. In Java, there is one-line Boolean checker/assigner (for lack of a better term):</p>
<pre><code>int result = (x)?y:z;
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to use a similar approach in Python, but I am not sure whether this structure exists. Is there a way to declare a variable, check whether a condition is true and assign it to one of two values without using if/else?</p>

<p>You can use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="nofollow">conditional expression</a>:</p>
<pre><code>result = y if x else z
</code></pre>
