<p>A quick question for Python 2.7</p>
<p>Are global variables visible to a subprocess?</p>
<p>Can a subprocess change the values of global variables?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>The processes doesn't share the variables in a <code>general operating system</code> terms. Use some communication mechanism like message passing, shared memory etc to achieve the inter process communication.</p>

<p>No, global variables are not visible to a sub-process. Variables are private to each process. If you want to share variables then you need to use some form of inter-process communication.</p>

<p>Maybe the simplest way is write those into a file and read from the file in another process, although this might take extra time.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">if you want to run closely related Python code in child processes then consider <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>multiprocessing</code> module</a>: it allows to send objects between processes just by passing them as function parameters (among other IPC methods)</span>
