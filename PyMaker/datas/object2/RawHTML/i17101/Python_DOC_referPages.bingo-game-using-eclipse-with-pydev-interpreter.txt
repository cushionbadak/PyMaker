<p>Please, help me out in generating bingo game. I am using eclipse with "pydev" interpreter. till now i have worked this much. But I am not able to generate the matrix in a way, that 5 random numbers between 1-15 should be in 1st "COLUMN" and not in "ROW", similarly numbers between 16-30 in 2nd COLUMN, 31-45 in 3rd COLUMN, 46-60 in 4th COLUMN and finally 61-75 in 5th COLUMN. So, basically it becomes 5*5 matrix. My code generates the random numbers but not in the matrix form, i want.</p>
<pre><code>import random
c1 = random.sample(range(1,15),5)
c2 = random.sample(range(16,30),5)
c3 = random.sample(range(31,45),5) 
c4 = random.sample(range(46,60),5)
c5 = random.sample(range(61,75),5)

matrix = [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5]  # why the ',' at the end of this line???

print(matrix)


for i in range(len(matrix)):
    for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
        print("%s  "%(matrix[i][j], ) )
    break
print()

for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        print("%s  "%(matrix[i][j],) )    
print()

<p>First of all, to have a range from 1 to 15, you need to use <code>range(1, 16)</code>, the second argument, called <em>stop</em>, is never included in the list. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow">range function</a> in the documentation.</p>
<p>To answer your question, you can put your first list in the first column instead of the first row by using the <code>zip</code> function. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow">zip function</a> in the documentation.</p>
<pre><code>matrix = zip(c1, c2, c3, c4, c5)
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, you should learn a little more about Python syntax. It could really help you. It's designed to be simple. It's a really beautiful language, easy to read and easy to use. You can almost read every line as if it was English. Here is your loop rewritten:</p>
<pre><code>for row in matrix:
    for item in row:
        print(item, end=" ")
        # Note the "end" argument, which replaces the newline by a space
    print()  # Newline at the end of the loop
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">all the above runs when i try to make it run in python, but it doesn't work when I am trying to display the same thing in command prompt using the :  "connectionSocket.sendall(bytes(table))". Can someone please help me that?</span>
