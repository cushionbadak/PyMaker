<p>I'm trying to make a program to convert a number which is in base 6 to decimal(base 10). It doesn't seem to work. Could anyone please help.</p>
<pre><code>a = 75
if a == 0:
    return 0
a = str(a)
result = (a[0])
for i in a[:1]:
    result *= 6
    result += (i)
print result
</code></pre>
<p>The result does not work.</p>
<p>Now let's say I try to add 2 base 6 numbers. How do I proceed? I tried to convert each number to base 6 and add them, the answer is not correct. I also tried to add them first and then convert to base 6 but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>How would I proceed for multiplication as well?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int"><code>int</code></a> function, with the radix parameter, like this</p>
<pre><code>int(str(number), 6)
</code></pre>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code>print(int(str(55), 6))
# 35
print(int('10', 6))
# 6
print(int('6', 6))
# ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 6: '6'
</code></pre>

<p>The question "How can I add 2 base 6 numbers or multiply them" does not really make sense.</p>
<p>All numbers in a computer is in base 2.</p>
<p>In addition the base is just a representation.  So (The number with base 10 representation '75')+(The number with base 10 representation '103')=(The number with base 10 representation '178') does not depend on the base.</p>
<p>Base is a feature when you need to display the number, because then there needs to be a conversion from bits to characters.  In most programming languages this is by default to base 10.</p>
<p>So to answer your question "How can I add 2 base 6 numbers or multiply them?"
I would say; you don't, you do arithmetic on base 2 numbers.
If your Input/Output is in base 6 you need to take care when reading/writing the numbers so that the conversion is to the correct base.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">FYI, "75" is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_6" rel="nofollow noreferrer">base-6</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">But that's decimal to base 6, right? I need the opposite</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sab Nope, it is base 6 to decimal</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. But how can I add 2 base 6 numbers or multiply them&gt;</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sab Convert both the numbers to base 10, do whatever operations you want to do and then convert back to base 6 with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2267428/1903116">this answer</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sab the base is just a way of <i>representing</i> a number - in Python terms, a rule for str &lt;-&gt; int, rather than an intrinsic part of the number itself. Once you have it in an <code>int</code>, you can multiply and add them in the usual way.. Then convert the result back to a string using base 6 to <i>display</i> it. The result of calculations are the same regardless of what base you do them in (... provided you stick to whole numbers, but that's another story) - your computer almost certainly uses base 2 internally, for example, but most programs, including Python, display it back to you in base 10 by default.</span>
