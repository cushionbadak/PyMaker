<p>You haven't stated your environment, but you can use TkInter if you are doing GUI work with Python. <a href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm" rel="nofollow">http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/canvas.htm</a> 
Note there are a huge number of Python GUI choices, but TkInter is the official Python one: <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming" rel="nofollow">https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming</a>
If you are in a web environment, then my advice would be to stick with javascript and the canvas tag. </p>

<p>If I understand the question correctly, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">turtle</a> to draw anything you want in python. As the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle" rel="nofollow noreferrer">turtle</a> webpage says, "it uses tkinter for the underlying graphics"</p>
