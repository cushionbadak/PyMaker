<p>I am making code for a program that determines attributes for a character, I want my program to <code>print</code> in the style or 'char1 has a strength value of str1 and a skill value of skl1' I looked for a way to do this in Python 3.3.2 and found this however I keep on getting an error while running it like this; </p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "E:\CA2 solution.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    print('% has a strength value of % and a skill value of %'(char1,strh1,skl1))
TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know what this is and it is hindering my progress, this is the code;</p>
<pre><code>import random

char1=str(input('Please enter a name for character 1: '))
strh1=((random.randrange(1,4))//(random.randrange(1,12))+10)
skl1=((random.randrange(1,4))//(random.randrange(1,12))+10)
print('% has a strength value of % and a skill value of %'(char1,strh1,skl1))
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure what's wrong if anyone could help me out that would be great, thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have your syntax mixed up; to use a string as a template, you need to use the <code>%</code> operator <em>between the string and the tuple</em>; the placeholders use <code>%s</code> to interpolate values as strings:</p>
<pre><code>print('%s has a strength value of %s and a skill value of %s' % (char1, strh1, skl1))
</code></pre>
<p>Without that <code>%</code> in between Python sees that as a <code>'...'()</code> function call on the string object.</p>
<p>I'd instead recommend you use the newer <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow"><code>str.format()</code> method</a> to apply string formatting; it is more readable, uses a method call rather than an operator, and is more flexible:</p>
<pre><code>print('{} has a strength value of {} and a skill value of {}'.format(char1, strh1, skl1))
</code></pre>
<p>Especially when you only have <em>one</em> value to implement this is easier to use as you won't fall into the <code>(oneitem)</code>-is-not-a-tuple pit that many beginning Python users fall into.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code> print('%s has a strength value of %s and a skill value of %s'%(char1,strh1,skl1))
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>print("{0} has a str of {1} and skill of {2}".format(char1,strh1,skl1))
</code></pre>
<p>(although the numbers inside the curly braces are optional in python2.7 + I number them for compatibility with python &lt;= 2.6 )</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Looks like you're trying to use percent style formatting, but you forgot the percent between the string and your parameters. In any case, you ought to use <code>string.format</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Add a <code>%</code> between the string and the tuple of arguments: <code>'...' % (char1, strh1, skl1)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bakuriu there is more problems than that ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JoranBeasley Yes, but the OP didn't ask for that. The question is specific, and about a simple typographical error. I've decided to vote to close and comment to give a feedback to the OP as to what was his "syntax error" (although not a <code>SyntaxError</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+1 for actually explaining the error something I all too often forget to do (and another +1(if i could) for explaining why they should use the newer str.format method :)</span>
