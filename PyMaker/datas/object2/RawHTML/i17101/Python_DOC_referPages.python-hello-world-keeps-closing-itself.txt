<p>I'm new to programming. I''ve successfully wrote everybody's first program , however , it executes right before closing itself. How can I add a pause to the program?</p>

<p>Modify the code to be like this, you will learn about the below function soon enough:</p>
<pre><code>print('Hello world!')
input()
</code></pre>
<p>Now at the end of the program it won't exit until you press <kbd>Return</kbd>.</p>
<p>Or better still, run the code in a shell like IDLE so you don't have to worry about all that.</p>

<p>You need to put a call to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input</code></a> at the bottom of your script:</p>
<pre><code>print("Hello World!")

input("Press 'Enter' to exit.") # Use raw_input in Python 2.x
</code></pre>
<p>Doing so will keep the output window open until you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.</p>

<p>If you literally want to add a fixed pause, use the <code>sleep</code> function in the <code>time</code> module. The is discussed in detail in the answer to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/510348/how-can-i-make-a-time-delay-in-python">How can I make a time delay in Python?</a> . Your program then becomes:</p>
<pre><code>import time
print("Hello world")
time.sleep(1)
</code></pre>
<p>The first line tells python that <code>time</code> means the module <code>time</code>, while the last line says to wait for 1 second. (If you wanted to wait for 2.5 seconds, then change the last line to <code>time.sleep(2.5)</code>, etc...)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you show what you have written so far?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suppose sleep function is more complex than input function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Harmone - <code>time.sleep</code> will wait for as long as you tell it, then the window will close.  <code>input</code> will keep the window open until you press a key.</span>
