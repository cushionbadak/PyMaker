<p>I am creating a game style program and are looking for a command that will just end the program at a certain point. There are no syntax errors and it all correctly indented in the idle.</p>
<p>I want this command to execute after the 'YOU DIED GAME OVER' bit of the if statment.
I tried to look for anything online but i couldn't find any hints. 
Code below</p>
<pre><code>buy2a = input ('Type Y to drink the strange liquid and type N not to')
if buy2a == 'Y' or buy2a == 'y':
    chance2a = 2 #random.randint(1,4)
    if chance2a == '2' or chance2a == '4' :
      print ('You start to choke and you black out')
      print ('YOU DIED')
      print ('GAME OVER')
      # &gt;Thing im looking for goes here!&lt;#
else :
    print ('You feel strange')
    time.sleep(1)
    print ('You blackout but wake up several hours later')
    time.sleep(1)
    health = 20
    print ('You feel a lot better and now have ' + str(health) + ' health')

else :
    print ('You pass on the offer with a weak reason and head off in a hurry')
print ('You enter the next town on weiry feet')

<p>Use (this is standard practice for exiting):</p>
<pre><code>import sys  # At the start of file.
sys.exit()  # When you want to exit.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Built-in <code>exit()</code> function will work. Another option is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html?highlight=exit#sys.exit" rel="nofollow">sys.exit</a>.</p>
<p>Both <code>sys.exit</code> and <code>exit</code> raise the same exception <code>SystemExit</code>. The difference is in convenience: you need to import <code>sys</code> module every time you want to use <code>sys.exit</code> and <code>exit</code> is the part of <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/site.html" rel="nofollow"><code>site</code> module</a> that's imported during the initialization.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also raise the exception directly</p>
<pre><code>raise SystemExit()
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You should <code>break</code> out</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are errors in the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Having to call <code>exit()</code> in your code to terminate the program on normal behaviour might indicate that you did not structured it well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Pretty sure the <code>exit</code> is only intended for interactive use</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Eric I personally prefer <code>exit</code> because it's shorter</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is not recommended: you're directly raising a builtin exception instead of the preferable (and overwrittable) <code>sys.exit</code> wrapper. Also the brackets are not necessary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexThornton: can you point me to anything explaining why <code>sys.exit</code> is better than <code>raise SystemExit</code>?</span>
