<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to analyze a specific part of a txt.file (lines 48-392) and I have problems numbering the single lines of the txt file.
This is what I was able to come up so far:</p>
<pre><code>with open ('kafka_hungerkuenstler.txt', encoding = 'utf-8') as f:
    for line in f:
    #I tried: enumerate (line)
    #there should also be something like read_selected_lines (filename, 48,392) somewhere in
     the code      
        print (line) 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.islice()</code></a> to pick a certain range of lines:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import islice

with open ('kafka_hungerkuenstler.txt', encoding = 'utf-8') as f:
    for line in islice(f, 47, 392):
</code></pre>
<p>The loop will only iterate over lines 47 (counting from zero) until 391, inclusive; counting from 1 that's line 48 through to 392, inclusive.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Is that the 49th line (counting from 0) or the 48th line (counting from 1)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it's the 48th line counting from 1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">replace <code>for line in f:</code> with <code>for line in f.readlines()[47:392]:</code></span>
