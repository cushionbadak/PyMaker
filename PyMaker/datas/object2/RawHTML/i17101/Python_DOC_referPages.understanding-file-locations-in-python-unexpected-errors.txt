<p>I am learning python 3.3 in windows 7. I have a two text files - lines.txt and raven.txt in a folder. Both contain the same text for the first example.</p>
<p>When I try to access ravens, using the code below, I get the error - </p>
<pre><code>OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument: 'C:\\Python\raven.txt'
</code></pre>
<p>I know that the above error can be fixed by using an escape character like this - </p>
<pre><code>C:\\Python\\raven.txt
C:\Python\\raven.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Why do both methods work ? Strangely, when I access <code>lines.txt</code> in the same folder, I get no error ! Why ?</p>
<pre><code>import re

def main():
    print('')
    fh = open('C:\Python\lines.txt')

    for line in fh:
        if re.search('(Len|Neverm)ore', line):
            print(line, end = '')

if __name__ == '__main__':main()
</code></pre>
<p>Also, when I use the line below, I get a completely different error - <code>TypeError: embedded NUL character</code>. Why ?</p>
<pre><code>fh = open('C:\Python\Exercise Files\09 Regexes\raven.txt')
</code></pre>
<p>I can rectify this by using <code>\</code> before every \ in the file path. </p>

<p>\r is an escape character, but \l is not. So, lines is interpreted as lines while raven is interpreted as <code>aven</code>, since \r is escaped.</p>
<pre><code>In [1]: len('\l')
Out[1]: 2
In [2]: len('\r')
Out[2]: 1
</code></pre>
<p>You should always escape backslashes with <code>\\</code>. In cases your string doesn't have quotes, you can also use raw strings:</p>
<pre><code>In [9]: len(r'\r')
Out[9]: 2
In [10]: r'\r'
Out[10]: '\\r'
</code></pre>

<p>maybe you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.0/ref/strings.html" rel="nofollow">raw string</a>.</p>
<p>just like this <code>open(r'C:\Python\Exercise Files\09 Regexes\raven.txt')</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When an <code>r' or</code>R' prefix is present, backslashes are still used to
  quote the following character, but all backslashes are left in the
  string. For example, the string literal r"\n" consists of two
  characters: a backslash and a lowercase `n'. String quotes can be
  escaped with a backslash, but the backslash remains in the string; for
  example, r"\"" is a valid string literal consisting of two characters:
  a backslash and a double quote; r"\" is not a value string literal
  (even a raw string cannot end in an odd number of backslashes).
  Specifically, a raw string cannot end in a single backslash (since the
  backslash would escape the following quote character). Note also that
  a single backslash followed by a newline is interpreted as those two
  characters as part of the string, not as a line continuation.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can actually use forward slashes instead of backward ones, that way you don't have to escape them at all, which would save you a lot of headaches. Like this: 'C:/Python/raven.txt', I can guarantee that it works on Windows.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">can you tell me the cause for the error <code>ypeError: embedded NUL character</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's because of <code>\0</code> sequence in <code>'C:\Python\Exercise Files\09 Regexes\raven.txt'</code></span>
