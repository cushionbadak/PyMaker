<p>I need help trying to sum up numbers in a list while ignoring duplicates. Let's say I have a list [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3] the answer should be 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. The extra 2 and extra 3s should not be included in the calculation.</p>
<pre><code>def sumOfUniqueNums(list):

    sum = 0

    list1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
    remove = []
    [remove.append(i) for i in list1 if i not in remove]

    sum(list1)

    return sum
</code></pre>
<h1>Updated function</h1>
<pre><code>def sumOfUniqueNums(numbers):
    return sum(set(numbers))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset" rel="nofollow">set</a> cannot contain duplicate values, so it's as simple as</p>
<pre><code>sum(set(list1))
</code></pre>
<p>Python will let you override built-in names, though, so you'll need to unassign <code>sum</code> before this will work.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this, should work fine:</p>
<pre><code>def sumOfUniqueNums(values):
    return sum(set(values))

print sumOfUniqueNums([1,1,2,2])
3

print sumOfUniqueNums([1,1,2,2,3])
6
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What language ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm using Python language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">use a set for this. <code>sum(set(list1))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">so the updated function works for you now? If so, I would recommend accepting one of the below answers</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I found the solution. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm getting an error: line 9, in sumOfUniqueNums     sum(set(list1))  TypeError: 'int' object is not callable</span>
<span class="comment-copy">probably because you have set sum = 0 before trying this line? The above line should be all that is in your function, apart from the return keyword perhaps</span>
<span class="comment-copy">make sure you don't use 'sum' or 'list' as variable names as they clash with reserved names in python(sum is already a function, and list is a type of data structure)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So all I should have in my function/code is: def sumOfUniqueNums(list): return sum(set(numbers))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I updated my function above for easier observation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for mentioning that. My bad!</span>
