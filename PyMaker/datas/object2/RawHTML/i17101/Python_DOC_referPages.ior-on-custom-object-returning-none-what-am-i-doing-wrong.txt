<p>Produces <code>None</code>. What am I doing wrong here?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html" rel="nofollow">the docs:</a> on <code>__ior__</code> and other methods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These methods are called to implement the augmented arithmetic assignments (+=, -=, <em>=, /=, //=, %=, *</em>=, &lt;&lt;=, &gt;&gt;=, &amp;=, ^=, |=). These methods should attempt to do the operation in-place (modifying self) and return the result (which could be, but does not have to be, self).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So your method should <code>return self</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def __ior__(self, other):
    self.n |= other
    return self
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@LevLevitsky: might as well make it an answer, no?  @MikeRand: are you sure that's your code?  Isn't <code>return other |= self.n</code> a syntax error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DSM yep, will do. For a moment I thought I was wrong, but yeah, that was the problem</span>
