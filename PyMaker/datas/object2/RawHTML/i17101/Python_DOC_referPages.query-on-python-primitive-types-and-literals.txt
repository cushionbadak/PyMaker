<p>After going through this document <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.2/index.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>, I have following queries:</p>
<p>Q1)
Java has <code>byte</code>/<code>short</code>/<code>int</code>/<code>long</code>/<code>char</code>/<code>float</code>/<code>double</code>/<code>boolean</code> static types, python document mentions only <code>int</code>/<code>float</code>/<code>complex</code> dynamic types(classes), As everything is object(in python), Can i say that these are the 3 classes that handle primitive values in python?</p>
<p>Q2)
In java, Integer Literal is a Decimal/Hex(start with 0X/0x)/Octal(start with 0) Numeral, What about Integer Literals in python? In java for instance <code>char</code> supports value ranges 0-65535 unsigned , What about value ranges in python?</p>
<p>Q3)
In java, Floating-point literal(FPL) is a Decimal FPL or Hexadecimal FPL. Decimal FPL is <code>&lt;digits&gt;&lt;.&gt;&lt;digits&gt;&lt;ExpPart&gt;&lt;f|F|d|D&gt;</code> where ExpPart consists of <code>&lt;e|E&gt;&lt;+|-&gt;&lt;digits&gt;</code>(the sign is optional). How does Python describe Decimal FPL &amp; Hexadecimal FPL?</p>
<p>Q4)
In Java, Character Literal is  <code>&lt;'&gt;&lt;Character|EscapeSequence&gt;&lt;'&gt;</code> are represented in UTF-16 so supplementary characters cannot be represented by a single literal and require a surrogate pair, Does python support character literal? </p>

<ol>
<li>There are no special primitive types in Python.</li>
<li>Python integers have unlimited length.</li>
<li>There are no hexadecimal floating point literals in Python, but it looks like a simple and useful feature that might be reasonable to propose for inclusion in future versions of the language.</li>
<li>There are no character literals in Python, only string literals. You can escape any character in a string literal with a 8-digit code (<code>\Uxxxxxxxx</code>), or save space on BMP characters with a 4-digit code (<code>\uxxxx</code>), or use exotic characters without escaping in an appropriately encoded source file. No hacks.</li>
</ol>

<p>A1. sure ... thats reasonable to say if you are talking about numbers ... </p>
<p>A2. Same with python (0x10,010(0o10 in py3),0b1101) and reversing you just call <code>int('01011',base)</code> where base is between 2 and 32 (inclusive)</p>
<p>A3. the same I think, Im not really sure what you are asking.  and theres always the decimal class (which stores it as 2 integers)</p>
<p>Q4. no ... python has no single character ... only strings  (you can do something like <code>chr(ascii_val)</code> or <code>unichr(unicode_ordinal)</code> ) ... in python2 its normal bytestrings in python3 its unicode strings.  you will need to tell it how to decode the bytestring from external sources ... most people use utf8</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It appears you'd be better served by reading a full introductory text on Python, perhaps one with a focus on people with Java experience.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@delnan i think this is an introductory tut <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.2/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a> that i had been thru, but i felt python documentation is not as good as JLS in java world. i could not find answers for abov query</span>
<span class="comment-copy">lorenzo am unable to write octal numbers for integer literal. Doe we have proper docs  which describe this info.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's a manual; octal literals are in a FAQ, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html?highlight=octal#how-do-i-specify-hexadecimal-and-octal-integers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/faq/…</a> and in the language reference, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integer-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/…</a></span>
