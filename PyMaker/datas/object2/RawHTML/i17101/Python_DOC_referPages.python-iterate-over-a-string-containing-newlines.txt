<p>I have a string separated by newline characters, I need to work with each line individually. I though I would be able to iterate over by using a for loop. However this prints each character individually.  </p>
<p>Example: </p>
<pre><code>convo = "Bob: Hello \n Sandy: How are you? \n Bob: Confused by a python problem"

for line in convo:
    print(line)

&gt;&gt;&gt; B
&gt;&gt;&gt; o
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
&gt;&gt;&gt; :
</code></pre>
<p>What would be the best way to do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>str.splitlines</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; convo = "Bob: Hello \n Sandy: How are you? \n Bob: Confused by a python problem"
&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in convo.splitlines():
...     print(line)
...
Bob: Hello
 Sandy: How are you?
 Bob: Confused by a python problem
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>str.splitlines([keepends])</code></p>
<p>Return a list of the lines in the string, breaking at line boundaries. This method 
  uses the universal newlines approach to splitting lines. Line breaks are not included in the resulting list unless keepends is given and true.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Split the string by newlines using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines" rel="noreferrer"><code>str.splitlines()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>for line in convo.splitlines():
    print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>splitlines()</code> uses <em>universal newlines</em> to split the string, meaning that it'll support line separator conventions of different platforms.</p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; convo = "Bob: Hello \n Sandy: How are you? \n Bob: Confused by a python problem"
&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in convo.splitlines():
...     print(line)
... 
Bob: Hello 
 Sandy: How are you? 
 Bob: Confused by a python problem
