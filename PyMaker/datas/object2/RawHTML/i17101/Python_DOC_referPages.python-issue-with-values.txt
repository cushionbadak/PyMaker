<p>I am trying to write a program in python (just learning as it looks a nice language) but have come across a small problem.</p>
<p>My code works for the most part but decided to print found process rather than just the first found process. All i want it to print out is whether it has found a process or not.</p>
<p>I have searched for sshd for example and my output has been</p>
<pre><code>found
found
found
</code></pre>
<p>as there are 3 processes running.</p>
<p>my code is </p>
<pre><code>import os
import signal

vProcessName = "sshd"

for line in os.popen("ps xa"):
    fields = line.split() 
    if vProcessName  in fields[4]: 
        print("Found")     
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you for any help you may provide its greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-break-statement" rel="nofollow"><code>break</code> statement</a>, you can get out of the loop:</p>
<pre><code>for line in os.popen("ps xa"):
    fields = line.split()

    if vProcessName  in fields[4]:
        print("Found")
        break # &lt;----
</code></pre>
<p>Alternativing using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow"><code>any</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>if any(vProcessName in line.split() for line in os.popen("ps xa")):
    print("Found")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">And what is the question? Why doesn't it leave the cycle after first finding? How about <code>break</code>?</span>
