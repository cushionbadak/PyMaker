<p>I have the below arrays. I want to use the <code>random_round_i</code> arrays to create 3 interquartile plots, <code>upper_limits</code> to show the upper limit for each boxplot, base as a bottom line for all, and flow as an individual plot again.</p>
<p>I am not putting everything in boxplots, because flow, upper_limits and base are coming from different sources, and in fact I need to compare their values with the random </p>
<pre><code>random_round_1=[0.508477, 0.509855, 0.517986]
random_round_2=[0.506998, 0.523818, 0.503029]
random_round_3=[0.524584, 0.53033, 0.514867]
flow = [0.503688, 0.507809, 0.504012]
upper_limits = [0.544946, 0.568013, 0.616112]
base = [0.481581] 
</code></pre>
<p>How can I create one plot, in shich I have base as one horizontal long line below all boxplots, then the box plots next to each other, and finally flow and upper_limits as normal plots. </p>

<p>When I just use the code below, the boxplots and the line plots don't match at the correct positions. I want those lines to go through all three boxplots.</p>
<pre><code>    plt.boxplot([random_round_1, random_round_2, random_round_3])
    plt.plot(upper_limits)
    plt.plot(flow)
    plt.hlines(y = base, xmin = 0, xmax = 4)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that your box plots are centered at x = 1, 2 and 3. However, when you use <code>plt.plot(upper_limits)</code> and <code>plt.plot(flow)</code>, you are just passing the y-values. In this case, the default x-values starts from 0. Therefore, your curves are not falling at the same x-values on top of box plots. </p>
<p>You need the correct x-mesh starting from 1 which can be generated using either <code>range</code> or <code>np.arange</code>.</p>
<pre><code>plt.boxplot([random_round_1, random_round_2, random_round_3])
plt.plot(range(1, len(upper_limits)+1), upper_limits)
plt.plot(range(1, len(flow)+1), flow)
plt.hlines(y = base, xmin = 0, xmax = 4)
</code></pre>
