<p>I am sending Temperature, Humidity and Light sensor data from a remote XBee module to a local one. The remote XBee is connected to a sensor board with STM32 microcontroller and two sensors, the data from the sensors is sent to a microconterller then to XBee in order to transfer it wirelessly to another XBee. I don't have any problem with the microcontroller part. but when I get the data from the remote XBee I want to display it in python. I am getting the correct data but I need to add variable names to my sensor data. for instance the first sensor data is the temperature data which comes as an integer and what I need is to see the temperature sensor values as; Temp = xx(integer values).
Here is the python code I used.</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python
import serial
from xbee import ZigBee

serial_port = serial.Serial('COM22', 9600)

zb = ZigBee(serial_port)

while True:
    try:
        print('Data Received from Xbee')
        data = zb.wait_read_frame() #Get data for later use

        #print data # for debugging only
        print data['rf_data']

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        break

serial_port.close()
</code></pre>
<p>and this is my python sensor data output</p>
<pre><code>   Data Received from Xbee
23
32
103

Process finished with exit code -1
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>print 'Temp = {}'.format(data['rf_data'])</code></p>
<p>where <code>data['rf_data']</code> is your temperature data</p>
<p><code>{}</code> will be replaced but what values you have in the format method in order</p>
<p>So if you have print <code>{} and {}'.format(1,2)</code> you will print <code>1 and 2</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I didn't understand the problem. Do all data come from the same serial port? How do you know which sensor is the source?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, all the data comes from the same serial port. I arranged it like that when I was writing the microcontroller codes, The first one is the temperature, the second is the humidity and the last one is the light sensor.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>"my python sensor data output"</i>: So, your frame data are separated with <code>\n</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes! the data coming from the remote XBee is separated with \n</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't temp, hum, light = zb.wait_read_frame().split['\n'] work then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The sensor values format order is like this; the first data which is 23 is the temp data, the second one which is 32 is the humidity data and the last one is the light sensor data. I need  to assign the first one as temp = 23, hum = 32, light = 103</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So <code>zb.wait_read_frame()</code> will return all this 3 values? If yes, then you can unpack them like this: <code>temp, hum, light =  zb.wait_read_frame()</code> or <code>temp, hum, light =  zb.wait_read_frame()['rf_data']</code> if your method is a dictionary amd the key rf_data contains your data</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, I tried to unpack them before but it didn't work!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide what <code>zb.wait_read_frame()</code> actually returns?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">23 32 103,    it returns these values, which also can change according to the room temperature.</span>
