<p>I need to convert three lists into decimal lists to check maximum and minimum value in them. How can I do it? example Lists:</p>
<pre><code>binary_list = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 10, 10, 11, 100, 100, 11, 10, 0]

quaternary_list = [-11, -33, -22, -132, -220, -310]

octal_list = [62, -220, -36, 5, 0, 1, -12]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If I understand your question correctly, you could do something like this (<a href="https://glot.io/snippets/f9b8381eey" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try it online</a>):</p>
<pre><code>binary_list = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 10, 10, 11, 100, 100, 11, 10, 0]
quaternary_list = [-11, -33, -22, -132, -220, -310]
octal_list = [62, -220, -36, 5, 0, 1, -12]

def list_to_decimal(lst, base):
    return [int(str(item), base) for item in lst]

print(list_to_decimal(binary_list, 2)) # =&gt; [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 0]
print(list_to_decimal(quaternary_list, 4)) # =&gt; [-5, -15, -10, -30, -40, -52]
print(list_to_decimal(octal_list, 8)) # =&gt; [50, -144, -30, 5, 0, 1, -10]
</code></pre>
<p>It works using a function <code>list_to_decimal</code> that takes a list <code>lst</code> and a base <code>base</code>, which then uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a list comprehension</a> to interpret every element of <code>lst</code> as a number of <code>base</code>.</p>
<p>Does that answer your question?</p>

<p>You can do it like this.</p>
<pre><code>binary_list = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 10, 10, 11, 100, 100, 11, 10, 0]
quaternary_list = [-11, -33, -22, -132, -220, -310]
octal_list = [62, -220, -36, 5, 0, 1, -12]

binary_list_do_dec = [int(str(i), 2) for i in binary_list]
quaternary_list_do_dec = [int(str(i), 4) for i in quaternary_list]
octal_list_do_dec = [int(str(i), 8) for i in octal_list]

print(binary_list_do_dec)
print(quaternary_list_do_dec)
print(octal_list_do_dec)
</code></pre>
<p>The output looks like:</p>
<pre><code>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 0]
[-5, -15, -10, -30, -40, -52]
[50, -144, -30, 5, 0, 1, -10]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried converting individual number before adding it to the list, but it did not work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't need to do any conversions to find mins or maxes. Just use the built-in <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code> functions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Something doesn't work here, function is correct but output is wrong. I checked some of converted numbers with online converter and they doesn't equal</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nevermind, second attempt succeed, evidently I had an fallacy somwhere in syntax. I think it was problem with the complexity of loops I used, before refactoring them. Before that, I tried to compare outputs of your answer and sharif's answer, which were inconsistent. After simplifying the code of entire program, issue dissapeared. Strange thing, I haven't met something like it before, becouse I didn't make any major changes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright! Glad I could help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I also found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54601616/#comment95999978_54601616">David Bowling's comment</a> quite enlightening. For example, in <code>binary_list</code>, the maximum value is <code>100</code>, which also happens to be the maximum value of the list if you interpret it as decimal values, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. :)</span>
