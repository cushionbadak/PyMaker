<p>My Code:</p>
<pre><code>answer = str(raw_input("Is the information correct? Enter Y for yes or N for no"))
if answer == "y" or answer == "Y":
  print("this will do the calculation")
else:
  exit()
</code></pre>
<p>Is this way the correct to use condition with OR operator?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, that is a correct use of the OR operator, you could avoid the use of the OR making the input lower or uppercase, but as I understand the question you are more interested in the OR syntax which is valid.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">you can use <code>if answer.lower() == 'y':</code> or <code>if answer in ('y', 'Y'):</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that's the correct way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If it is the wrong way .. you get behavior that does not work or errormessages with stacktraces. Did you get any? If not - why ask? This is tutorial - material: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements</a>  - not a question for SO.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Totally unrelated, but <code>raw_input()</code> will always return a string.</span>
