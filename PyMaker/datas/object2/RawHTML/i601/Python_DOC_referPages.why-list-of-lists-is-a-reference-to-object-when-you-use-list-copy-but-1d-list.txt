<p>Here a screenshot of output. Please explain why it works this way and provide me with a solution on how to make the copy of a list of lists</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/abUZF.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the result of work</a></p>
<pre><code>matrix = [['I','A','O','O','I'],['I','A','O','O','I'],['I','A','O','O','I'],['I','A','O','O','I'],['I','A','O','O','I']]

matrix_1d = ['I','A','O','O','I']

matrix2 = matrix.copy()
matrix2_1d = matrix_1d.copy()
def printMat(m):
    for i in range(len(m)):
        print (m[i])

matrix[0][0] = 'lol'
matrix2[0][1] = 'kek'

matrix_1d[0] = 'lol'
matrix2_1d[1] = 'kek'

printMat(matrix)
print("_")
printMat(matrix2)
print("_")
print(matrix_1d)
print("_")
print(matrix2_1d)

<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> clearly states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return a shallow copy of the list.</p>

<p>What you want instead is a <strong>deep</strong> copy.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your output and code are both text, don't post links to screenshot of it. Copy paste them into the question</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>.copy</code> creates a shallow copy. The inner objects are not copied, a reference to them is put in a <i>new list</i>. You want a <i>deep copy</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As per @juanpa.arrivillaga  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17246693/what-exactly-is-the-difference-between-shallow-copy-deepcopy-and-normal-assignm" title="what exactly is the difference between shallow copy deepcopy and normal assignm">stackoverflow.com/questions/17246693/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks ! But why I have copies in 1d list if i should have references to initial list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BorysAltynnyk it works <b>exactly</b> the same. Your "1-d" list copy has references to the items in the original list, just as your "2-d" list copy does. You can check the <code>id</code>'s for yourself. And they aren't references to the <i>initial list</i>, they are references to the <i>objects contained by the original list</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga. But if objects of new list are references to objects of the initial list, why changing them in copy list don't affect them in the initial list? (Have a look on the picture attached, you will understand what I am talking about)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BorysAltynnyk you never try to change them. You <i>change the list</i>. Where do you believe you try to change the objects in the "1-D" list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BorysAltynnyk When you do <code>matrix2_1d[1] = 'kek'</code>, you assign the reference at index <code>1</code> of the copied list to point to a different object. <b>This does not change the object referenced by the original list</b>. Nor does it change any reference in the original list.</span>
