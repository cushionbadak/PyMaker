<p>In file <code>sched.py</code> I do import:</p>

<p>But python tells:</p>

<p>File <code>sched.py</code> is placed in the same level that directory <code>controller</code>.</p>
<p>Inside directory <code>controller</code> I have file <code>api.py</code></p>
<p>Why Python gives me such error?</p>

<p>You need to place an empty file named __init__.py in your 'controller' directory.  This file denotes that directory as being a Python module.  See:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">does the directory have <code>__init__.py</code> file ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Directory where is placed <code>sched.py</code> contains <code>__init__.py</code>, but there is no this file where is <code>controller/api.py</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I had the same thought as YOLO.  If you do have a__init__.py file, then maybe you can show us the actual error.  I assume you're saying that you're getting "ImportError: No module named controller.api", but you don't say that explicitly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then that's your problem.  You need an __init__.py" in the 'controller' directory</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, it can be empty.  That file defines a python module.  The code in that file will be executed when you import it, so there's lots of stuff you can do in that file to adjust your namespace, import other files, etc.  But an empty file is quite common.</span>
