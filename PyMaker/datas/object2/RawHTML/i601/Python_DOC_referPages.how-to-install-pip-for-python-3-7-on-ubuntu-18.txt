<p><strong>EDIT 18/02:
Since I still don't have a solution, I'm updating with what I know so far.</strong></p>
<p>I've installed python 3.7 successfully. 
I can install modules using pip (or pip3) but those modules are installed in Python 3.6 (Comes with ubuntu). Therefore I can't import those modules in python 3.7 (get a module not found)
Python 3.7 doesn't recognize pip/pip3, so I can't install through pip/pip3
I need python 3.7</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I've installed Python 3.7 on my Ubuntu 18.04 machine. Following this instructions in case it's relevant: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Download : Python 3.7 from Python Website [1] ,on Desktop and manually
  unzip it, on Desktop Installation : Open Terminal (ctrl +shift+T)</p>
<pre><code>Go to the Extracted folder
$ cd ~/Desktop/Python-3.7.0
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</code></pre>
<p>Making Python 3.7 default Python :</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo vim ~/.bashrc
press i
on the last and new line - Type
alias python= python3.7
press Esc
type - to save and exit vim
:wq
now type

<p>I've downloaded several modules through <code>pip install module</code> but when I try to import them, I get a <code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module names 'xx'</code></p>
<p>So I did some research and apparently when used pip to install, it installed in the modules in previous version of Python. 
Somewhere (probably a question in SO) I found a suggestion to install the module using <code>python3.7 -m pip install module</code> but then I get <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.7: no module named pip</code>.</p>
<p>Now I'm stuck, pip is installed, but apparently not for Python 3.7. I'm assuming that if I can install pip for Python 3.7, I can run the pip install command and get the modules I need.
If that is the case, how can I install pip for python 3.7, since it's already installed?</p>

<p>The command you're looking for is:</p>
<pre><code>python3.7 -m pip install package
</code></pre>
<p>Took me a surprisingly long time to figure it out, too. The docs about it are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html#basic-usage" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>To install all currently supported python versions (python 3.6 is already pre-installed) including pip for Ubuntu 18.04 do the following:</p>
<p>To install python3.5 and python3.7, use the deadsnakes ppa:</p>
<pre><code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.5
sudo apt-get install python3.7
</code></pre>
<p>Install python2.7 via distribution packages:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install python-minimal  # on Ubuntu 18.04 python-minimal maps to python2.7
</code></pre>
<p>To install pip use:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install python-pip  # on Ubuntu 18.04 this refers to pip for python2.7
sudo apt install python3-pip  # on Ubuntu 18.04 this refers to pip for python3.6
python3.5 -m pip install pip # this will install pip only for the current user
python3.7 -m pip install pip
</code></pre>
<p>I used it for setting up a CI-chain for a python project with tox and Jenkins.</p>

<p><code>pip3</code> not <code>pip</code>. You can create an alias like you did with <code>python3</code> if you like.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Already tried, output: <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.7: no module named pip</code> [Same for pip3]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like your Python 3.7 install is missing pip. You could try installing it using: <code>python3.7 -m ensurepip</code>. Also, I notice that you installed from source. If the above options don't work for you, then perhaps try installing via apt instead: <code>apt install python3.7</code>? The apt package comes with the pip module installed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried <code>python3.7 -m ensurepip</code>, it installed but when I used <code>python3.7 -m pip install package</code> got a bunch of errors. Since I was on a VM, I went back before installing python 3.7 and tried <code>apt install python3.7</code> and then <code>python3.7 -m pip install package</code>. Now everything is running smooth. Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Same issue. <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.7: no module named pip3</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">in your terminal, type <code>$ which pip</code> and <code>$ which pip3</code> and see what both of those say.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>/usr/bin/pip</code> and <code>/usr/bin/pip3</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, what exactly are you typing into the terminal to see the error <code>no module named pip3</code> or whatever?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>python3.7 -m pip3 install psycopg2</code>. If i just use <code>pip3 install psycopg2</code> it downloads the module, but I still can't import it in Python 3.7.</span>
