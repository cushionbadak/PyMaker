<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In my Python code, I have a text file in a sub-directory of my original python program that I would like to read. I am aware of the os.chdir() function, and it does work to do change the directory to where the file is before I read the file. However, I want this code to work on any machine no matter the directory, so is there a simple way to notate a changepath to a sub-directory so that it would work on any computer?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<pre><code>-root folder
---run.py
---otherstuff
---lib folder
------otherlib folder
---------textfile.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately what (I think) you are trying to do is not practical. One can scan through subdirectories with a method such as: </p>
<pre><code>p = Path('.')
[x for x in p.iterdir() if x.is_dir()]
[PosixPath('.hg'), PosixPath('docs'), PosixPath('dist'),
PosixPath('__pycache__'), PosixPath('build')]
</code></pre>
<p>I implore you to look through <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html</a> for more information on this to see if you can solve your problem.</p>
<p>However, I am assuming that your code is intending to perform some operation on a textfile, and you want to be able to use any computer to feed this (or any) file to your program to run. The best way to go about solving this problem is to use argparser. That way you can feed your program a file when running it on the command line and it will execute so long as it exists in the user's directory. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>#delcare an argparse
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()

#argparser takes a text file input
parser.add_argument('-file', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                         help='please enter file name to read')

#parse arguments
args = parser.parse_args()

#save input file as file
f = args.file.read()

#close the file
args.file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Here is more information on argparse: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html</a></p>
<p>Happy coding.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What does your directory tree look like, and what have you tried so far?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay I edited the original post, sorry I tried to make that make sense @grooveplex</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can read it using a relative path open("lib folder/otherlib folder/textfile.txt")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you @Atirag that's what I was looking for! :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I appreciate the help but I simply just wanted to read data to my program from a txt file, like as if it were a settings document or something. Atirag was able to help</span>
