<p>Environment: Windows 10 Pro. I don't want to download any .exe installer or modify my Windows path. I want all files needed for a program to work in a single directory, and if a data directory is needed, some option to let me specify that, same with configuration files. I would use Linux but I'm at work.</p>
<p>I downloaded and unzipped <code>python-3.7.2.post1-embed-amd64.zip</code> and added the path where I unzipped it to my PATH (.bash_profile as I'm using cygwin on Windows). So now I have python installed,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$python-v Python 3.7.2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apparently I need to also install pip to get anything done. I search and find this statement:</p>
<pre><code>https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/win/#install3-windows
All supported versions of Python 3 include pip, so just make sure itâ€™s up to date:
python -m pip install -U pip
</code></pre>
<p>That statement is false, the .zip file did not contain pip. So I search some more and am instructed to type:</p>
<pre><code>$python get-pip.py
</code></pre>
<p>and so I do: and get:</p>

<p>I then add pip.exe to my .bash_profile path, not modifying my Windows path.</p>
<p>And so now I run:</p>
<pre><code>python -m pip install -U pip

<p>and I get:</p>
<pre><code>H:\\apps\\python\\3.7.2\\python.exe: No module named pip

<p>Why is it telling me something about my D:\ drive and a path D:\obj, that I know nothing about? I installed python, the .zip file under H:\apps\python\3.7.2\python.exe</p>
<p>I can't pip install or pip upgrade anything, and have no idea why it is talking about my D:\ drive or if I even have a D:\ drive.</p>
<p>Should I be able to download a .zip file, put the .exe in my path and start coding? Should I not have to install pip, if it's so very necessary for using Python? I don't know why it's missing in the .zip file, I don't know why it does not work.</p>

<p>Using the zip is not a supported installation method for windows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The embedded distribution is a ZIP file containing a minimal Python environment. It is intended for acting as part of another application, rather than being directly accessed by end-users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to install Python on your machine you'll have to use the "evil" installer.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Under Windows 10, you can run the Linux subsystem, and hence run Python on (say) Ubuntu.</p>
<p>First activate/install Windows Power Shell.</p>
<p>Then follow instructions from here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10</a></p>
<p>You will be able to install Ubuntu with a command-line prompt, and thence, Python.</p>
<p>(Windows-filesystem files are accessible from Ubuntu, but Ubuntu-filesystem files should ideally not be accessed from Windows)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">According to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#using-python-on-windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>, the embeddable installer "is a minimal package of Python suitable for embedding into a larger application" whereas the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-full-installer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">full installer</a> "contains all components and is the best option for developers using Python for any kind of project".  So perhaps you should try the full installer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The Python environment is indeed complicated and the recommended package management/installation tools have evolved over time to make it as smooth as possible. You seem to strongly want to go a different way, which is fine; and it's fine to ask for help; but it hardly seems fair to blame this on Python's ecosystem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can run python on docker, bind the volume to docker image so you will get acess to hard drive</span>
