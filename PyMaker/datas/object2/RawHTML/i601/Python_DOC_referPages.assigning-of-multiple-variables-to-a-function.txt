<p>I have something that I dont understand here. I mean, it works, but I would like to understand what is going on behind the scenes:</p>
<pre><code>def load_data():
    f = gzip.open('mnist.pkl.gz', 'rb')
    training_data, validation_data, test_data = pickle.load(f, encoding="latin1")
    f.close()
    return (training_data, validation_data, test_data)
</code></pre>
<p>so, what I am trying to understand is here, in line 3, there are 3 variables(training_data, validation_data and test_data). These are being assigned to one function though!? My question is, what happens to them and/or the function? Is the function executed three times? Or are the variables simply a function then that can be called? Or is the loaded data being split in 3 parts, a third of them being distributed to every variable? I am a noob, so this is probably stupid, but please help me!</p>

<p>This is called sequence unpacking. You can find it in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python documentation</a>., where it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The statement <code>t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'</code> is an example of tuple
  packing: the values <code>12345</code>, <code>54321</code> and <code>'hello!'</code> are packed together in a
  tuple. The reverse operation is also possible:</p>
<pre><code>x, y, z = t
</code></pre>
<p>This is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works for any sequence on the right-hand side.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This feature of the language makes it easy to write functions which seem to return multiple results (although they actually just return a tuple), e.g.</p>
<pre><code>def get_three_numbers():
    return 5, 7, 11

a, b, c = get_three_numbers()
</code></pre>

<p><code>pickle.load(...)</code> is executed <strong>once</strong>. The construct you see is called <em>unpacking</em> and is more or less equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>result = pickle.load(f, encoding="latin1")
training_data = result[0]
validation_data = result[1]
test_data = result[2]
</code></pre>
<p>(actually unpacking does one more thing: it assures that <code>result</code> has exactly 3 elements) Does this help?</p>

<p>no the function is not performed three times,
but returns values at the same time.</p>
