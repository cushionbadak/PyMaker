<p>Whenever I run <code>pip</code> to install the Flask packages like <code>virtualenv</code> in Ubuntu 16.04, I get this error:</p>
<p><code>pip install virtualenv</code></p>
<p><code>Requirement already satisfied: virtualenv in ./.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages (16.1.0)
No metadata found in ./.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages
Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/virtualenv-16.1.0.dist-info/METADATA'</code></p>
<p>Here are my pip and python versions:</p>
<p><code>pip --version
pip 19.0.1 from /usr/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pip (python 3.5)</code></p>
<p><code>python3 --version
Python 3.6.8</code></p>
<p>I already tried almost all that I get from the internet to solve this issue like:</p>
<p><code>/usr/.local/bin/pip install virtualenv</code></p>
<p>But I still get the same error.</p>
<p>I also go into the dist folder to copy the metadata.json with METADATA, but there's no metadata.json file inside.</p>
<p><code>cd /usr/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/virtualenv-16.1.0.dist-info/
</code>
<code>cp metadata.json METADATA</code></p>
<p><code>cp: cannot stat 'metadata.json': No such file or directory</code></p>
<p>Please help me, I'm stucked with this issue for days. 
Thanks!</p>

<p>I encountered the same problem recently.</p>
<pre><code>Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip-19.0.1.dist-info/METADATA'
</code></pre>
<p>In the folder</p>
<pre><code>~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip-19.0.1.dist-info/
</code></pre>
<p>I found another one named <code>pip-19.0.1.dist-info</code>, and the last one contained all the required files for the <code>pip</code>.</p>
<p>I just used</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip-19.0.1.dist-info/
cp -r ./pip-19.0.1.dist-info/* ./
rm -r ./pip-19.0.1.dist-info
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously that you need to replace <code>python</code> version with your own and also check if files </p>
<pre><code>entry_points.txt  INSTALLER  LICENSE.txt  METADATA  RECORD  top_level.txt  WHEEL
</code></pre>
<p>are in here.</p>
<p>Maybe it will help you, luck.</p>

<p>I think the root of your error is that your <code>pip</code> is configured to work with Python3.5 (and looks in its specific Pythonpath for the metadata), while your Python version is 3.6.8</p>
<p>Virtual environments in Python 3 have been made simpler, in my opinion, with the usage of the built-in <code>venv</code>. Also, your Python and Flask versions should coincide, which is here, not the case. </p>
<p>I'd suggest you take the following steps</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">new virtual environment</a> using</li>
</ul>
<p><code>python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Activate the virtual environment by </li>
</ul>
<pre><code>cd /path/to/new/virtual/environment
source env/bin/activate
</code></pre>
<p>You now have an isolated, clean-slate environment, where you only have a single version of Python.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Run <code>pip install --upgrade pip</code> to upgrade the virtual environment pip to the version that is compatible with your Python version.</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code>pip install flask</code>, and install your whole stack from scratch, so that the libraries and Python executable versions are aligned.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I got same error</p>
<pre><code>Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/vagrant/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip-18.1.dist-info/RECORD'
</code></pre>
<p>It seems that there is a conflict between /usr/bin/pip and /home/vagrant/.local/lib/python3.7/.</p>
<p>My solution is avoiding the error.</p>
<ul>
<li>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt</li>
<li>I deleted the /home/user/.local/lib/python3.7 dir</li>
<li>sudo pip install --upgrade pip</li>
<li>pip install -r requirements.txt --user</li>
<li>fixed it</li>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I have held broken packages so after trying that, I just get a new error that says: <code>Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/usr/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/virtualenv-16.1.0.dist-info/RECORD'</code> My only option is to just reinstall my Ubuntu for fresh setup. Thanks anyway! This could be a solution for other people.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I get this error when executing <code>python3 -m venv /path/to/my/new/venv</code>:      <code>Error: Command '['/usr/path/to/my/new/venv/bin/python3', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1.</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>/path/to/my/new/venv</code> should be the path to where you want your virtual environment to be created. It could be like <code>~/myawesomeproject</code> or <code>~/flaskapp</code>. Where are you trying to create your environment at? Do you have write permissions on that directory?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, specifically here ~/dashboard. I typed <code>python3 -m venv ~/dashboard/</code> Then error returned with <code>/home/zhanrah/dashboard/venv/bin/python3</code> above.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem should be that the <code>venv</code> version present, is too, incompatible with Python, and stuck with 3.5, as it was also <a href="https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1059" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reported by others</a>. Could you try updating it with <code>sudo apt-get install python3.6-venv</code> and reporting back with the result?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is what I get when I update it:  <code>Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree        Reading state information... Done The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:   apache2-bin libapr1 libaprutil1 libaprutil1-dbd-sqlite3 libaprutil1-ldap liblua5.1-0 Use 'sudo apt autoremove' to remove them.</code></span>
