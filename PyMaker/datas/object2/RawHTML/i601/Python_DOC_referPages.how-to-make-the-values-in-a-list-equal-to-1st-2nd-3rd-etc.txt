<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm not trying to find the highest value or rank them in a certain order. I need the first value to be the 1st place, second value the 2nd place, you get it. Honestly, I couldn't find it done in the simplest way nor done in the way I'm describing. I'm sure it's be done but I haven't found anything. </p>
<p>Example: <code>['10','11','12','13,'14']</code></p>
<p>'10' = 1 or 1st</p>
<p>'11' = 2 or 2nd</p>
<p>'12' = 3 or 3rd</p>
<p>'13' = 4 or 4th</p>
<p>'14' = 5 or 5th</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Not sure what your end goal is with this...Maybe this is what you are looking for</p>
<pre><code>number_list = ['10','11','12','13','14']
my_dict = {}
for index, number in enumerate(number_list, 1):
    my_dict.update({number: index})
print(my_dict)
</code></pre>
<p>Result:</p>
<pre><code>{'14': 5, '12': 3, '13': 4, '10': 1, '11': 2}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If I'm understanding, <code>index</code> should be what you want:</p>
<pre><code>yourList.index('10') + 1
</code></pre>
<p>Will return 1 as it's the first element (with index value 0).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can put the values into a dictionary to make it easy to look them up:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = ['10','11','12','13,'14']

&gt;&gt;&gt; lookup = {number: place for place, number in enumerate(numbers, 1)}

&gt;&gt;&gt; lookup['12']
3

<span class="comment-copy"><code>enumerate(mylist, start=1)</code>? Make it <code>enumerate(sorted(mylist), start=1)</code> if the values aren't already in order.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"you get it" - no, I don't get it. It's already in order.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Excuse me, as we know, in the world of code, the first value in a list actually equals 0 and the next equals 1 and it keeps going. Whenever you're counting, you start at 0. What I want is the first card to equal 1 NOT 0. Common sense.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Edit the question to make it better.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can pass a <code>start</code> parameter to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><b><code>enumerate</code></b></a> so rather than counting from <code>0</code> you can make it count from <code>1</code>. You also don't need to coerce <code>index</code> to an <code>int</code> as it's already an <code>int</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PeterWood thanks for the info! I updated my answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is basically the same as my answer right? Or is list comprehension faster than looping here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you posted your answer while I was typing mine. The comprehension is probably faster.</span>
