<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm new to programming and learning about the sort function. While I did search and looked at a number of SO articles regarding sort/lambda and some even very similar to my situation, I am still having a hard time grasping how exactly this code works. I also read the docs (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html</a>) and the examples there make sense to me but I can't seem to carry this knowledge onto this example here. Would someone be kind enough to help me with the code below? I understand this can be a duplicate but I am only asking because I don't have the knowledge base to get what I've read from other similar posts. Please help if you can, thanks. </p>
<pre><code>a = [13, 15, 81, 4]
b = [0, 1, 2, 3]
b.sort(key = lambda x:a[x])
b = [3, 0, 1, 2]
</code></pre>
<p>How does the order of list 'b' change from [0, 1, 2, 3] to [3, 0, 1, 2]? How does the list 'a' come into play?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It sorts <code>b</code> as if each element in <code>b</code> had the value of the corresponding value in <code>a</code>. It might help to see what happens if you sort tuples consisting of each value.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(zip(a, b))
[(4, 3), (13, 0), (15, 1), (81, 2)]
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the second element of each tuple, where they are sorted in the order of their first elements.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer. I understand the logic based on your example but could you help me understand what happens little more under the hood?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's not too much to say. Functions like <code>sort</code> that take a <code>key</code> argument apply the function to each element <i>once</i>, and uses the result (rather than the element itself) when performing comparisons.</span>
