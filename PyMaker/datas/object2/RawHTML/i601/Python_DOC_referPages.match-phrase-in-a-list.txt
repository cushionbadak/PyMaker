<p>I am looking to match a phrase inside a list.</p>
<p>I'm using python to match a phrase inside a list. The phrases can be in the list, or it can't be inside a list.</p>
<pre><code>list1 = ['I would like to go to a party', 'I am sam', 'That is 
correct', 'I am currently living in Texas']

phrase1= 'I would like to go to a party'
phrase2= 'I am sam'
</code></pre>
<p>If phrase1 and phrase 2 are inside the list1, return correct or 100%. The purpose of it is to make sure that phrase 2 and phrase 2 are matched word for word.</p>
<p>Conversely, If the phrase is not inside a list or only one phrase is inside, for instance in list 2, then return false or 0%.</p>
<pre><code>list2 = ['I am mike', 'I don't go to party', 'I am sam']

phrase1= 'I would like to go to a party'
phrase2= 'I am sam'
</code></pre>
<p>phrases can be changed so that it can be different than just those two phrases. For instance, it can be changed to whatever user sets like 'I am not good.'</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It seems like you simply want to check for membership in the list:</p>
<pre><code>list1 = ['I would like to go to a party', 'I am sam', 'That is correct', 'I am currently living in Texas']

phrase1 = 'I would like to go to a party'
phrase2 = 'I am sam'

if phrase1 in list1 and phrase2 in list1:
    # whatever you want, this will execute if True
    pass
else:
    # whatever you want, this will execute if False
    pass
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am not sure about I understand you but I guess maybe you can try</p>
<pre><code>if phrase1 in list1
</code></pre>
<p>to check whether a phrase is in a list. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow noreferrer">all</a> and a comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>def check(phrase_list, *phrases):
  return all(p in phrase_list for p in phrases)
</code></pre>
<p>In use:</p>
<pre><code>list1 = ['I would like to go to a party', 'I am sam', 'That is correct', 'I am currently living in Texas']

phrase1= 'I would like to go to a party'
phrase2= 'I am sam'

print(check(list1, phrase1, phrase2))
#True
print(check(list1, 'I am sam', 'dragon'))
#False
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set</a></p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<pre><code>set(list1) &gt;= {phrase1, phrase2}
#True
</code></pre>
<p>Or like this:</p>
<pre><code>#you can call this the same way I called the other check
def check(phrase_list, *phrases):
  return set(list1) &gt;= set(phrases)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
<p>To print 100% or 0% you could simply use an if statement or use boolean indexing:</p>
<pre><code>print(('0%', '100%')[check(list1, phrases)])
</code></pre>
<p>To do this in your <code>return</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>return ('0%', '100%')[the_method_you_choose]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead of returning true, how to assign a value like 100%?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What you're looking for is called an <code>if</code> statement... I edited my answer..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd like to add up the % and return the complete % at the end. So, if I got both correctly(You have two print statements above), it'd be 100%. If not, 50%. What's best way to do this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try this: <code>len(set(list1) &amp; set(phrases)) / len(phrases)</code></span>
