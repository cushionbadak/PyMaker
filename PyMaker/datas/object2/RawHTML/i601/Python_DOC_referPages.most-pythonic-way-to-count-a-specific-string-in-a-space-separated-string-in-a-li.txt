<p>I have a list that looks like <code>['$25 million', '$22 million', '$3.3 billion']</code> and I want to count how many times million, billion show up.</p>
<p>I am using the script below that works but I wonder if it is the most pythonic way.  </p>
<pre><code>million = 0
billion = 0
not_mb = 0
for price in money_lower:
  if price.split().count('million') &gt; 0:
    million += 1
  elif price.split().count('billion') &gt; 0:
    billion += 1
  else: not_mb += 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>collections.Counter</code> is your best bet for things like this. You'll need to preprocess the list to extract the million/billion.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; collections.Counter(item.split()[1] for item in money_lower)
Counter({'million': 2, 'billion': 1})
</code></pre>
<p>(Note, this is more elegant than your solution, but not more efficient, since it requires two passes over the data.)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also join list to string and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>count()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>money_lower = ['$25 million', '$22 million', '$3.3 billion']

money_lower = ''.join(money_lower)
million = money_lower.count('million') 
billion = money_lower.count('billion')

print(million)  # 2
print(billion)  # 1
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Whilst all of the other answers are definitely very <em>pythonic</em> and <em>elegant</em>, it's not always the most important thing to strive for. Your original code is actually the only one so far to go over the list <em>once</em>. I'd maybe simplify it just a tad:</p>
<pre><code>for price in money_lower:
  if 'million' in price: million += 1
  elif 'billion' in price: billion += 1
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise your code is easy to read and performant (counts with a single pass).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could pick the elements of the list <code>money_lower</code> which contain specificic words <em>(such as <code>million</code> or <code>billion</code>)</em> as follows;</p>
<pre><code>money_lower = ['$25 million', '$22 million', '$3.3 billion']

million =  [m for m in money_lower if "million" in m]
billion =  [b for b in money_lower if "billion" in b]
</code></pre>
<p>Now you have 2 lists(<em>million,billion</em>) which contains the targeted elements of the <code>money_lower</code> list. If you want to learn how many elements in the lists, you can use the <code>len()</code> function as follows;</p>
<pre><code>print("Count of the string million: ", len(million))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I chose this as the best answer because I had made a poor assumption of my data and this actually found an error I had 15k entries in the list and one of them was "the hundreds of millions of dollars"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is a great one to simplify my script as well thanks!</span>
