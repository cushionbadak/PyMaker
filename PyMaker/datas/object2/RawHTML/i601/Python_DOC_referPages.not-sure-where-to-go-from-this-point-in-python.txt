<p>Here's my problem: <img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/ezXWZzc.png"/></p>
<p>I have everything covered up until the third part of the question. I just don't know where to go from there. Can I get some help on what to do?</p>
<p>Here's what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>userInt = int(input('Enter integer (0 - 155):\n'))

userFloat = float(input('Enter float:\n'))

userCharacter = input('Enter character:\n')

userString = input('Enter string:\n')

print(userInt, userFloat, userCharacter, userString)

print(userString, userCharacter, userFloat, userInt)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should take a look at the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_chr.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">chr() function</a> documentation, it's quite clear.</p>
<p>Plus, I think you should also look at those:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_join.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">join() function</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/list_reverse.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reverse() function</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update</strong><br/>
  It seems your problem is with formatting the the output, so here it is:  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">use the <code>chr</code> function maybe?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please don't post images of text.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The instruction seems quite specific, you need to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>chr</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm aware of the chr() function, I'm just not sure what to put in order to make it print "99 converted to a character is c" as the assignment requires. (I am brand new to coding, so excuse my ignorance)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is no problem with not knowing, but I will not make a better answer than what you can find on the pages I linked. But if your problem is with formatting text, you should have been more specific about that (I updated my answer). I also think the questions 1 and 2 want you to use the <code>join</code> and <code>reverse</code> functions.</span>
