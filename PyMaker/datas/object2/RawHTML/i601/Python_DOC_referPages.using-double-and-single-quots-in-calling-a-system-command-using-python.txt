<span class="comment-copy">"the actuall value which needs to be submitted for every different run" What values? What do you actually need help with?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i am reading a file and getting the names for the servers and storing in the variable with comma sapeated values. now i want to invoke the above command and in place of variable i want all those server names to be submitted while invoking the command</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess</a> module and pass the command and its arguments as a list. Then the quotes won't be much of an issue.</span>
