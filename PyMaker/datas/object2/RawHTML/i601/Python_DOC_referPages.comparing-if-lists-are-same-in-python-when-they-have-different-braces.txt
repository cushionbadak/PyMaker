<p>I am curious, what do the 3 different brackets mean in python programming? Not sure if i'm correct about this, but please correct me if i'm wrong.</p>
<pre><code>[] - # Normally used for dictionaries, list items
() - # Used to identify params
{} - # I have no idea what this does... 
</code></pre>
<p>Or if these brackets can be used for other purposes, any advises are welcomed! Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<ul>
<li><code>[]</code>: Used to define mutable data types - lists, list comprehensions and for indexing/lookup/slicing.</li>
<li><code>()</code>: Define tuples, order of operations, generator expressions, function calls and other syntax.</li>
<li><code>{}</code>: The two hash table types - dictionaries and sets.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>() parentheses are used for order of operations, or order of evaluation, and are referred to as <em>tuples</em>.
[] brackets are used for lists. List contents can be changed, unlike <em>tuple</em> content.
{} are used to define a dictionary in a "list" called a <em>literal.</em></p>

<span class="comment-copy">They can do what ever you want when crating a custom class. This question is somewhat vague, please provide specific context.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! This is quite useful when I read the documentations again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, <code>()</code> do <b>NOT</b> define a tuple. As <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the official tutorial</a> says: "a tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas [...] on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested tuples are interpreted correctly; they may be input with or without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses are necessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression)". Another situation where the parentheses are needed is to create an empty tuple: <code>()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring I know, i was aware, but OP seemed like any extreme beginner, and I didn't want to introduce such subtleties.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fair enough, but I figure my comment may be useful for future readers. (FWIW, I just saw this page today because it was linked as a duplicate target to a question which has since been deleted).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wrong is wrong. They are incredibly well associated with tuples, but parentheses and tuples aren't the same thing. I cannot emphasize enough that teaching things incorrectly is an incredible hindrance. If you have to end up explaining to a person that a language you like is imperfect and occasionally is complicated, better to do that instead. Better to just have them run things like this through type(), even.</span>
