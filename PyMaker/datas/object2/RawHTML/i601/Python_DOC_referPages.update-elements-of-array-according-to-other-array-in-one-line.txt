<p>I have two arrays called y and R(same dimensions). R consists of 1 and 0's. I am trying to change y's elements to 0 if according element of R is 0, otherwise keep it same.
I attempted this one line:</p>
<pre><code>y=[0 for a in y if for b in r if b==0]
</code></pre>
<p>but it says invalid syntax. How should I change it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could enumerate one list, accessing the other list by index:</p>
<pre><code>y = [2,3,4,5,6,7]
R = [0,0,1,1,0,1]

res = [ 0 if R[i] == 0 else a for i, a in enumerate(y) ]
#=&gt; [0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 7]
</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre><code>[ 0 if r == 0 else y[i] for i, r in enumerate(R) ]
#=&gt; [0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 7]
</code></pre>
<p><hr/>
Alternative using NumPy:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
y = np.array([2,3,4,5,6,7])
R = np.array([0,0,1,1,0,1])

print(y * R)
#=&gt; [0 0 4 5 0 7]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Rewrite your list comprehension this way:</p>
<pre><code>y = [0 if j == 0 else i for i, j in zip(y, R)]
</code></pre>
<p>Your invalid sintax error comes from the <code>for</code> immediately after the <code>if</code>, it does not mean anything for the interpreter.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>y = [b and a for b, a in zip(r, y)]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, I know "for if" is a non-sense but I wondered maybe there is a similar version for that phrase.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know, I also cannot understand what you hoped to achieve with that sintax. <code>if</code> keyword must be followed by a statement which can be evaluated as true or false (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#booleans" rel="nofollow noreferrer">boolean operations</a>) otherwise is syntax error.</span>
