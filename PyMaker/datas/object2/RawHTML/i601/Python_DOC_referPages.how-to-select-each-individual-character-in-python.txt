<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I want the user to input a word and in a separate text file it will have something like a = z which means I want it to look at each character in their word and if there's an "a" it will be replaced with a "z".  How can I select each character in Python and replace letters/numbers etc in a word?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'll assume your file is a simple text file, with on each line, a letter, an equal sign, and then another letter to replace the first with.</p>
<pre><code>a=b
c=f
...
</code></pre>
<p>First, read the file, and construct a dictionary mapping the old values to the new ones:</p>
<pre><code>d = None
with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    d = {}
    for line in lines:
        old, new = l.split('=')
        d[old] = new

   # the last 5 lines accomplish the same thing as this
   # d = {l.split('=')[0] : l.split('=')[1] for l in lines]
</code></pre>
<p>Then iterate through that dictionary and preform the replacements.</p>
<pre><code>s = 'my cool string'
for old, new in d.items()
    s = s.replace(old, new)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>str.replace('a', 'z')</code> you don't need to loop though each char in the string. .replace essentially does that for you.</p>

<pre><code>str.replace(old, new[, max])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">why use a text file when you can use a dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to SO. Please take the time to read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a> and the other links found on that page.  You should invest some time working your way through <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Tutorial</a>, practicing the examples. It will give you an introduction to the tools Python has to offer for solving your problem.  There are many other good online Python tutorial resources.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm still fairly new to Python so I'm a little confused.  Can you explain the code for me?  I don't understand "as f" or the "d =...." part also, this code will check each character and replace it with the ones I set in my text file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">See my edit. Basically <code>d = {l.split('=')[0] : l.split('=')[1] for l in lines]</code> is a shorthand for creating dictionaries in python. I've replaced it in the code above with an identical albeit longer statement. As for the part with the <code>open</code> statement, that's how you read text files in python. If you're still new to that, I reccomend this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official tutorial to reading files</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Still lost :/.  I can't find anything that will fully explain that line of code.  Also, for s = 'my cool string' for old, new in d.items()     s = s.replace(old, new)  I don't understand the d.items() part.  I understand you have s = "my cool strin" and s = s.replace(old, new) will replace the older character with the new.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">At this point I recommend you read a good intro to python tutorial or book. Perhaps <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Beginner's guide</a> ? The line of code with <code>open</code> is detailed in the link above,  The second part (s = ... ) shows how to take your input string (s) and the apply all the replacement rules that you have just read from your text file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, I'm going to give this a full read over because I feel like I should understand exactly what this code is doing haha.  If you have any other recommended guides I would appreciate the link:).  Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're going provide a link, at least link the doc :) <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str%20replace#str.replace" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">just updated the link</span>
