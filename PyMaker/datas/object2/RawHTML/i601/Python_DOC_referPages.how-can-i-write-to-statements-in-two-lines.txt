<p>I want to write the following code in the trinket interactive shell. I don't know how two write the second statement without having the first one evaluated when I press enter on my keyboard.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 42 == 42
&gt;&gt;&gt; 42 == 99
True
False
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can create a suite of statements on one line by separating them with a semicolon. The REPL will evaluate the entire suite before printing the output:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 42 == 42; 42 == 99
True
False
</code></pre>

<p>This is not related to Python, it is all about how the <code>trinket</code> operates with the server.</p>
<p>After pressing "run code interactively", we can see the following requests:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9OoUQ.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9OoUQ.png"/></a></p>
<p>First 3 of them are just preparing the environment. The fourth one contains the following body (started at 713.77 ms):</p>
<pre><code>70:42["console",{"init":true,"files":"{}","input":"(4 &lt; 5) and (5 &lt; 6)"}]
</code></pre>
<p>And the fifth one is a websocket connection with the following frames (started at 858.40 ms):</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XJw1h.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XJw1h.png"/></a></p>
<p>As you can see, the code is sent in different requests (and even different protocols) and there is a chance (or maybe design choice) that the second code line is sent before the response for the first line has been received.</p>
<p>So, this particular case is not related to Python, it is all about how trinket communicates with the server. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">What are you trying to achieve by having the first statement be delayed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does <code>print(42 == 42); print(42 == 99);</code>  count?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, I just want to write two statements and then get both statements evaluated at the same time. First: &gt;&gt;&gt; 42 &lt; 100 and then create a new line: &gt;&gt;&gt; 42 &gt; 100 and then press enter and having both statements evaluated. This give me the output True and False. I don't know how to type that in, so embarrassing...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is such a basic question, I don't even know what keywords I should use to google it :-) hope, someone can give me an answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">okay, but WHY? What are you trying to do with it? I understand that you want the output "True" and "False" but what are you hoping to do with those outputs?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your reply. Ok, this works in the python shell. I think I have to get used to the trinket shell first, then I will understand how it differs from the python shell. Many thanks.</span>
