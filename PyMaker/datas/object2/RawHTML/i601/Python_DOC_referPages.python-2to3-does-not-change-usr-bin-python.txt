<p>I am in the process of converting my python code from 2.7 to 3 using 2to3.  It seems to convert as expected, except that my code always starts with the line <code>#!/usr/bin/python</code> which I expected to change to <code>#!/usr/bin/python3</code> but it doesn't.  Have I missed something?  Is there a way to get that to happen?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>#!/usr/bin/python</code> is not a <code>python</code> version-dependent statement, or even <code>python</code> at all. It essentially instructs a shell to execute the script (file) using the <code>python</code> executable (program) located at <code>/usr/bin</code>.</p>
<p>The intent behind <code>2to3</code> it get you along the path of converting your code to python 3, frequently doing all the work for you. It doesn't address issues outside the <code>python</code> code.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible for <code>/usr/bin/python</code> to <em>be</em> <code>python</code> 3. The #! line exists let a shell execute a script using what's typically a systems <em>default</em> <code>python</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think 2to3 is not supposed to do that. It transforms Python code and sees this line as a comment.</span>
