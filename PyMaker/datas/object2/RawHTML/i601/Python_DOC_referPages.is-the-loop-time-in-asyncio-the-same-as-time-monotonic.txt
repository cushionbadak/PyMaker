<p>Are these the same clock? <code>time.monotonic()</code> and <code>asyncio.get_event_loop().time()</code>. It seems to be the case on my system, but I cannot find any related documentation except this sentence:</p>

<p>Event loop uses monotonic clocks to track time.</p>

<p>Yes, that's how it is implemented:</p>
<pre><code>class BaseEventLoop(events.AbstractEventLoop):
    (...)

    def time(self):
        """Return the time according to the event loop's clock.
        This is a float expressed in seconds since an epoch, but the
        epoch, precision, accuracy and drift are unspecified and may
        differ per event loop.
        """
        return time.monotonic()
</code></pre>
<p>See more here: <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/fb2c3465f09e1f720cdae7eca87d62125a327fd9/Lib/asyncio/base_events.py#L635" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/fb2c3465f09e1f720cdae7eca87d62125a327fd9/Lib/asyncio/base_events.py#L635</a></p>
<p>Note that this holds for the default event loop. And <code>asyncio.get_event_loop()</code> can be overwritten to return some other implementation.</p>

<p>True, and in fact it states the exact opposite, that the event loop may use any monotonic clock whatsoever. The <strong>current implementation</strong> just calls <code>time.monotonic()</code> - which is not documented - but a future one may switch to, say, a more efficient clock that returns values different from those returned by <code>time.monotonic()</code>.</p>
<p>Having said that, note that it is not very <em>likely</em> for such a switch to happen, but as far as the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.time" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>loop.time()</code></a> contract is concerned, it is allowed.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">This answer correctly references the implementation, but the actual contract stated by the cited documentation is that <b>no</b>, you cannot rely on <code>loop.time()</code> returning values compatible with <code>time.monotonic()</code> - it might be implemented using a different clock in the future.</span>
