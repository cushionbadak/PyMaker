<p>The Problem is fairly the less of knowledge. But heres my problem.</p>
<p>I tried to do a while loop for figuring out which language the customer wants to choose</p>
<p>I tried to set a simple "Question-Answer" Script with a while loop. Continue for Var A(varr) and break for Var B(othervarr)</p>
<p>Python said "continue is not properly set in loop"
or "break outside loop"</p>
<p>So now my question is not to give me a superb code like you did (i even wouldnt understand) my question is whats the difference between a while loop and if/else ? Would it be better to do it with if/else statements ? And how split the possibilities for customer to choose "A" (and get script for a) or choose "B" (to get script for b) ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your time </p>
<pre><code>varr = "german"
othervarr = "english"

print("Hello everybody. This is the first Version of 'Ismypasswordsafe' ! If you want to enter in german, type german below, if you want to continue in english, type english below")
while input() == varr:
continue;
print("Du hast dich fuer Deutsch entschieden !")
if input() == othervarr:
break;
print("Alright you choosed English")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Indent your code and you want to save the input into a variable.  Once you have the chosen language you want to print one of two things so do if A else B</p>
<pre><code>varr = "german"
othervarr = "english"

print("Hello everybody. This is the first Version of 'Ismypasswordsafe' ! If you want to enter in german, type german below, if you want to continue in english, type english below")
lang = input()

while not (lang == "english" or lang == "german"):
  print("You must enter 'english' or 'german'")
  lang = input()

if lang == "english":
  print("Alright you choosed English")
else:
  print("Du hast dich fuer Deutsch entschieden !")
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT - Updated based on the comments to loop until one of the two languages was chosen.</p>
<p>While is a loop and will loop <em>while</em> the condition is true.  So in English: while lang is not english and not german loop asking for more input.</p>
<p>Hopefully this makes sense!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<ol>
<li>Always allot your input() to a variable.</li>
<li>Always indent your code.</li>
<li>As per your question, while and if/else are completely different things. The former being a loop i.e. it helps executing a particular set of operations over and again while if/else is a conditional statement i.e. ‘if’ the condition is satisfied this part is executed, ‘else’ the other one is. </li>
</ol>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To answer your question you don't want to use a while loop for this because it will only run while the condition is true.</p>
<p>so for your code</p>
<pre><code>while input() == varr:
</code></pre>
<p>is great if the user inputs german but will never start if the user inputs english.</p>
<p>You are much better off with a input that is outside any loop and then just use a if statement to check the input. </p>
<p>The problem with doing else after if is its not really checking the other input, its just saying if its not one it must be the other.</p>
<p>Please see below.</p>
<pre><code>varr = "german"
othervarr = "english"

language = input("Hello everybody. This is the first Version of 'Ismypasswordsafe' ! If you want to enter in german, type german below, if you want to continue in english, type english below")

if language == varr:
    print("Du hast dich fuer Deutsch entschieden !")
if language == othervarr:
    print("Alright you choosed English")
</code></pre>
<p>The other thing to note of course is that indentation is very important in python and dictates the order that the code is executed.</p>
<p>Your original error of "continue is not properly set in loop" is because the continue is in line with while.</p>
<p>it should be,</p>
<pre><code>while input() == varr:
    continue;
</code></pre>
<p>Now python knows the continue is inside the while loop.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You have to use indentation to declare the scope of the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't call <code>input()</code> twice, instead assign it to a variable, also indent your code and then we will talk about loops.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dave M, you are getting downvoted only because your code is not formatted. This is very important in Python, so please fix this so we can help you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think <code>else if</code> is better. And it seems OP wants to loop until input is either "German" or "English"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you really much. If you now can tell me the difference between a while loop and if/else my day ends up perfectly.  And yes in my thougths i wanted to loop until the language selection is done.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you see the difference now after I updated the code based on Benoit's comment?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Clearly ! Now i got it, Thanks in advance for spending your time to a beginner</span>
