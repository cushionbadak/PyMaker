<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have text file with below lines:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>[Thu Jan  3 09:28:11 2019]:(sending publish)
[Thu Jan  3 09:28:14 2019]:(sending publish)
[Thu Jan  3 09:28:17 2019]:(not connect )
[Thu Jan  3 09:28:19 2019]:(sending publish)
[Thu Jan  3 09:28:21 2019]:(sending publish)
</code></pre>
<p>Now I would like to check the timestamps in the text file whether lines have time difference as 3 seconds with <code>"sending publish"</code> term as well.</p>
<p>And if the sending publish is not available, need to print the text within (not connect)</p>
<p>from 4th line onwards, need to check the lines with 3 seconds difference.</p>
<p>I don't find any clue or I don't have any python code to compare lines(having timestamp) within single file as well..</p>
<p>Please do support with any examples / code.</p>

<p>If I get what you've asked correctly, the script you need to build should complete 2 tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reading text from txt file with python</li>
<li>Parse the information you need from a line string</li>
</ol>
<h1>Reading from  a file</h1>
<p>Here is sample code for opening and reading txt file in python:</p>
<pre><code>f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
for row in f:
  print(row)
</code></pre>

<h1>String Parsing</h1>
<p>To do that you can use both string slicing or regular expressions search, here is some information on both:</p>
<ol>
<li>Regular Expressions - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html</a></li>
<li>String Slicing - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types</a></li>
</ol>
<h1>Edit</h1>
<p>You can use datetime package in python to calculate time passed on both dates - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html</a></p>
<p>Hope it helps!</p>
