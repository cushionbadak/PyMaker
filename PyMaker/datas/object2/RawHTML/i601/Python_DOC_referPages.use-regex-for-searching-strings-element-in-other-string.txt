<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm looking for the best way to check if elements of strings are present in other string
I have two cases:</p>
<pre><code>string1 = "BMW Serie 3 Touring 318d 143ch Business"
string2 = "bmw serie 3"
</code></pre>
<p>i would like to do:
if elements in string2 are in string1 so do something</p>
<p>but in the other case</p>
<pre><code>string1 = "DS 7 crossback"
string2 = "ds7"
</code></pre>
<p>what i use in the first case, i cannot use for this case</p>
<p>I think that regex is the best way, but i dont know use match in if statement (Python) (of course i already used lower() to simplify the matching)</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help</p>

<p>You don't need to use regex, you can use a function  that is a part of the <code>strings</code> objects on <code>python</code> you can use <code>count</code> which give you the number of occurrences or just use <code>in</code> which will give you a <code>boolean</code> .  </p>
<p><strong>option 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code>string1 = "BMW Serie 3 Touring 318d 143ch Business"
string2 = "bmw serie 3"
if string1.count(string2) &gt; 0:
    print("contain")
else:
    string1 = "DS 7 crossback"
    string2 = "ds7"
</code></pre>
<p><strong>option 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code>string1 = "BMW Serie 3 Touring 318d 143ch Business"
string2 = "bmw serie 3"
if string2 in string1
    print("contain")
else:
    string1 = "DS 7 crossback"
    string2 = "ds7"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you want to add some tolerance to substring search, removing the spaces and converting to lowercase:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; string1 = "DS 7 crossback"
&gt;&gt;&gt; string2 = "ds7"
&gt;&gt;&gt; string2 in string1.lower().replace(" ","")
True
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#membership-test-details" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in</a> operator would solve this problem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you add desired results for these cases? It isn't clear what you consider to be an "element", and whether "ds7" is or is not in "DS 7 crossback". Do spaces count? How about capitalization?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">excuse me, what i meant is I want to match the example string "bmw serie 3" with for example the string "BMW Serie 3 Touring 318d 143ch Business" in other words, I want to retrieve all strings containing "bmw" "serie" and "3"</span>
