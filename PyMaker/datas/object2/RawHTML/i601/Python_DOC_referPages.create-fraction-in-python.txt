<p>I have been given a task at school to define a function name "fraction", work just as the Fraction Modules.
Here is how I do it:</p>
<pre><code>def GCD(x,y):
  while y!= 0:
    (x,y) =(y,x%y)
  return x  
def fraction(a,b):
  a/=GCD(a,b)
  b/=GCD(a,b)
  print(str(int(a))+"/"+str(int(b)))
</code></pre>
<p>But when I tried to see how it'd work, it became like this:</p>
<pre><code>fraction(45,9)
5/9
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know where I was wrong, can someone help me to figure it out?
Thank you so much.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In your def fraction, </p>
<pre><code>def fraction(a,b):
  a/=GCD(a,b)
  b/=GCD(a,b)
  print(str(int(a))+"/"+str(int(b)))
</code></pre>
<p>You modified a. a became 45/9 = 5. b divided by GCD(5,9) (which equals 1) will just be b. Instead, you could store the GCD in a temporary variable and divide both by it. </p>
<pre><code> def fraction(a,b):
  gcd = GCD(a,b)
  a//=gcd
  b//=gcd
  print(str(int(a))+"/"+str(int(b)))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you modify <code>a</code> before you calculate the <code>GCD</code> for <code>b</code>; your second <code>GCD</code> calculation will therefore always return <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>you could try this:</p>
<pre><code>def fraction(a,b):
  g = GCD(a,b)
  a //= g
  b //= g
  print("{}/{}".format(a, b))
</code></pre>
<p>also note that i used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#mapping-operators-to-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">integer division (floordiv) <code>//</code></a> so i do not get a float as result that i have to cast back to in <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your helpful answers, I've realized what I did wrong and make a new one combining all your answers.
Here is the new one:</p>
<pre><code>def GCD(x,y):
  while y!= 0:
    (x,y) =(y,x%y)
  return x  
def fraction(a,b):
  gcd=GCD(a,b)
  a=a//gcd
  b=b//gcd
  print(str(a)+"/"+str(b))
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you all so so much again, you have made my day.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is not a solution to your problem, but for someone else (&amp; maybe the OP also), if someone is wondering about the part <code>work just as the Fraction Modules</code>, it would work so, <code>print(Fraction(45, 9))</code> gives the output <code>5</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're modifying <code>a/=GCD(a,b)</code> before using it to calculate <code>b/=FCD(a,b)</code>. Just use <code>x=GCD(a,b)</code> as an intermediate measure, and use <code>x</code> to calculate <code>a</code>, and <code>b</code>. Then, it will work</span>
