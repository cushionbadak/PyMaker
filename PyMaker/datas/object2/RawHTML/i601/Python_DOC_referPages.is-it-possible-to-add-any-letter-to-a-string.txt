<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am parsing a database and extracting entries to a new database. For this I use keywords which should and keywords which should not be included. For a keyword I want excluded, it should be "-anyletter-fv", I wonder if -anyletter- is possible to program. If there is no letter, a space, a comma, or anything but a letter, I don't want to exclude it, only if there is specifically a letter in front of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If I understand you correctly, you try to exclude those cases in which your keyword starts with some letter.
Use library re for it (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html</a>)</p>
<pre><code>print(re.match("^\w.*", " keyword"))
</code></pre>
<p>will return a match object if a pattern that you look for is found, otherwise None.
You can use it for if-expressions.
the "^" marks the beginning of the sequence, "\w" matches all [a-zA-Z0-9], while ".*" matches all other sequences of varying length. 
Therefore you get matches for keywords that do not start with ascii character.
I hope this helps you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's not entirely clear to me what you're trying to do, but it's possible you could use a <i>regular expression</i> - see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes that is exactly what I meant, thank you for your help!</span>
