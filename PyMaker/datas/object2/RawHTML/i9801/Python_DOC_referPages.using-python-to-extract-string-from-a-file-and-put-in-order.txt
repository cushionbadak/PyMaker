<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text file, populated with the following:</p>
<pre><code>   "": "&lt;a href=\"#\" class=\"tree-title\" title=\"IP: 10.0.0.1\nHostname: hello1\nModel: 2901\nVersion: 1.1.1.1_80000\nState: Normal\"&gt;hello1(10.0.0.1)&lt;/a&gt;"
  },
  {
    "": "&lt;a href=\"#\" class=\"tree-title\" title=\"IP: 10.0.0.2\nHostname: hello2\nModel: 2911\nVersion: 1.1.1.1_80000\nState: Normal\"&gt;hello2 (10.0.0.2)&lt;/a&gt;"
  },
  {
    "": "&lt;a href=\"#\" class=\"tree-title\" title=\"IP: 10.0.0.3\nHostname: hello3\nModel: 2911\nVersion: 1.1.1.1_80000\nState: Normal\"&gt;hello3(10.0.0.3)&lt;/a&gt;"
  },
  {
</code></pre>
<p>It's not properly structured as it was scraped off and dumped into a text file.
There is over a 100 of such segments. 
Despite how it looks, the page was not in just html hence why I couldn't simply extract the data as a structured form.</p>
<p>Now I would like to use Python to extract just the <code>hostname, Model number</code> and <code>IP address</code> in an orderly list.</p>
<p>So it would look something like the following in new lines:</p>
<pre><code>hostname: hello1       Model No: 2901       IP address: 10.0.0.1&lt;br&gt;
hostname: hello2       Model No: 2911       IP address: 10.0.0.2&lt;br&gt;
hostname: hello3       Model No: 2911       IP address: 10.0.0.3
</code></pre>
<p>But I struggle to find how to do this by firstly extracting the necessary info from the first segment, then the next etc.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm not gonna fully answer this as you didn't show us any code. Rather I'll give you some hints that will help:</p>
<p><strong>The way I'd do it:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><code>strip()</code> away any new-line character and any space from your file</li>
<li>use a regex to match the groups you need. You can use <a href="https://regex101.com/r/tjw72s/1" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>this one</strong></a></li>
<li>Regex101 has also a nice way of generating the desired code in different languages so you'll be done after a bit of self-processing. (however, for learning purposes, I don't recommend it)</li>
<li>Look into <code>re</code> module and implement the above regex. You can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read the docs</a> for this</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, you'll have to manage yourself how to handle opening of a file, reading its content, apply all the above on it and order the data however you like. Good luck.</p>
