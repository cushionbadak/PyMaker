<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have 2 lists</p>
<pre><code>A=[1,2,3,4]
B=[5,6,7,8]
</code></pre>
<p>My expected Tuple should look like</p>
<pre><code>C=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
</code></pre>
<p>How can I combine these lists into my desired output?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's as simple as:</p>
<pre><code>tuple(A + B)
</code></pre>
<p>Which results in:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
&gt;&gt;&gt; B = [5, 6, 7, 8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(tuple(A + B))
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn't as hard as you thought, was it ? Just <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>have a look at the docs</strong></a> before asking here. </p>
