<p>I want to open a new cmd window and stream some text output (logs) while my python script is running (this is basically to check where I am in the script)</p>
<p>I can't find w way to do it and keep it open and stream my output.</p>
<p>Here is what I have now:</p>
<pre><code>import os
p = os.popen("start cmd", mode='w')

def log_to_cmd(process, message):
    p.write(message)

for i in range(10):
    log_to_cmd(p, str(i))
</code></pre>
<p>And I want to get 0 to 9 output on the same cmd window already open.
Thanks a lot for any suggestion.</p>

<p>use <a href="http://www.baremetalsoft.com/baretail/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Baretail</a> this software allows you to stream logs.</p>
<p>If you want to stick to cmd shell I'd suggest installing something like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GNU Utilities for Win32</a>. It has most favourites, including tail. <code>tail</code> which allows you to open file like a log veiwer .</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes I want to stick to cmd, and I can't install anything else</span>
