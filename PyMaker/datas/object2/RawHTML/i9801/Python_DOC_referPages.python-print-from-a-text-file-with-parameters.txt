<p>Trying to write a program that will look through a text file containing the NYTimes bestselling books and let the user search and print a book from the list. </p>
<p>Currently have this code that prints the line containing the name of the book they type:</p>
<pre><code>def lookup(): 
    file= input("Please enter the text file path: ")
    search = input("Enter the books you wish to search for:   ")
    search = [word.strip() for word in search.lower().split(",")]
    with open(file, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            line = "\n" + line  
            for word in search:
                if word.lower() in line.lower():
                    print(line)

lookup()
</code></pre>
<p>How would I let the user search for a year range? The txt file contains the book name, author, year published, etc. all separated by 1 tab space.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>How about using Pandas read_csv function?</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

#reads in the tab delimited file
df = pd.read_csv(file, delimiter ='\t')

#gives all rows where the book year is 2000 or 2001
#You can pass the list of years generated by the user to the isin() function
df.loc[df.loc[:,'Year'].isin([2000, 2001]),:]
</code></pre>
<p>This solution of course assumes that you can read the file into memory.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Searching for ranges is a little tricky, but FWIW, you can read your data in a more convenient way using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv</a> module. I suggest reading your file into a list of dictionaries, one dictionary per book.</span>
