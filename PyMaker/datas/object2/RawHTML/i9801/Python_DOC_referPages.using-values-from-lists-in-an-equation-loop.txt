<p>I have a short list with coordinates: (0|0) (10|0) (10|10) (0|10). Im trying to use these coordinates to calculate the area of the square they build. 
for loop should run 4 times and perfom the math written below.
when running i get the following error in the area = .... line: </p>
<p>TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable</p>
<pre><code>list = [[0,10,10,0],[0,0,10,10]]

def gaussarea(coords):
    area = 0
    for coords in coords:
        area = area + (coords[0][0] - coords[0][1]) * (coords[1][0]+coords[1][1])
    return area

a = (gaussarea(list))

<p>You are trying to access the index of an <code>int</code>, which is meaningless, since each <code>coords</code> is a list, not a nested list.</p>
<p>Assuming you get a rectangle (or square) for sure, you are good enough with</p>
<pre><code>def gaussarea(coords):
    area = (coords[0][1] - coords[0][0]) * (coord[1][2] - coords[1][1])

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>the value of <code>cords[0]</code> is an int. Therefore <code>cords[0][0]</code> is trying to index into an int, hence your error. You can remove the for loop and your code should work.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your variable names make this needlessly confusing.  Could you write out the first two lines of arithmetic so we can see what you're trying to do?  eg <code>area = area + (0 - 0) * (10 + 0)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">you're variable name <code>list</code> is conflicting with the <code>built-in</code> type <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list</a></span>
