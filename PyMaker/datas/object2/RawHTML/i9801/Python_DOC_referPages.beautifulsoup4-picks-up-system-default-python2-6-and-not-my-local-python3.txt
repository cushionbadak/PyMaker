<p>I am working in a system where I have no admin rights. I have my local environment where I have installed python3, pip3, and bs4. It seems that the default system python2.6 also has a beautifulsoup package installed. As a result, my Python code tries to pick up bs4 and ends up picking up the python2.6 one.</p>
<p>My code is:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
except ImportError as err:
    print("BeautifulSoup is not installed. To install it use apt-get install python-bs4 or visit https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ for more information. \n OS error: {0}".format(err))
    raise
</code></pre>
<p>I am using pip to install bs4 with this command: </p>
<pre><code>pip3 install beautifulsoup4 
Requirement already satisfied: beautifulsoup4 in /my-local-path/lib/python3.3/site-packages
</code></pre>
<p>Is there any way to force it to pick up the python3 one?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python 3 can't "pick up" python 2 package. You have not installed the correct bs4. For ubuntu, the package name is: <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/python/python3-bs4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python3-bs4</a>. </p>
<p>Also your error message in <code>except</code> block is misleading as it points to python2 bs4, while the code is is python 3.</p>
<p>If you can't install a new package on your system, set up a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">virtual-environment</a> and install your dependencies by pip.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you just install bs4 by running <code>apt-get install python-bs4</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Install <code>virtualenv</code> <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs</a> This will isolate all system wide python package anomaly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What can't you use a virtualenv?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am using pip to install bs4 with this command: <code>$ pip3 install beautifulsoup4 </code> <code>Requirement already satisfied: beautifulsoup4 in /my-local-path/lib/python3.3/site-packages</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot for the virtualenv proposal mootmoot. It not only solved my issue it also helped me find out that I actually needed python2.7 not 3.3 after all.  Try to leave an answer and I will accept at ones!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for your message. I am using:     <code>$ pip3 install beautifulsoup4 Requirement already satisfied: beautifulsoup4 in /my-local-path/lib/python3.3/site-packages</code>  And it seems like it is working ok. Therefore I think I already have the python3 beautifoulsoup.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I run my code though I am getting this error: <code>Traceback (most recent call last):   File "my-local-path/Desktop/ROOT-Primer/scripts/Build_html.py", line 102, in &lt;module&gt;     if child.name=='script':   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/bs4/element.py", line 667, in __getattr__     self.__class__.__name__, attr)) AttributeError: 'NavigableString' object has no attribute 'name' </code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">How are you running your code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is solved by using virtualenv but thank you so much for noticing the wrong url. I forgot to change it after i moved the project to different bs4.</span>
