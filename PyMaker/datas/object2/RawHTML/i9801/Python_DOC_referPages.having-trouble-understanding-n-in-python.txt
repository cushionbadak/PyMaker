<p>I dunno whats the purpose of this <code>\n</code> in <code>python</code></p>
<p>Here is an example shown below:</p>
<pre><code> rangeNum = int(raw_input("Enter the max number you'd like to go up to: \n"))
</code></pre>

<p>It is a special <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ASCII</a> character signifying the end of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(text_file)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">line</a> of text and the start of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline" rel="nofollow noreferrer">new line</a>. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's a line break</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you try removing it and see what happens?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is not a Python specific character. Actually, it is an ASCII character. There is plenty of information on Internet</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The direction of the slash is important.  <code>/n</code> is two characters, <code>\n</code> is one character, a new line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jalo:  Not all languages represent a line break as <code>\n</code>, so I would say it <i>is</i> Python specific.  ASCII certainly does not mandate that representation.  <code>\n</code> doesn't even map to a consistent ASCII character (it may be LF, CR+LF, or on older Macs, CR)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">... and more of them that Python supports in its string literals can be found here <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/â€¦</a>    Scroll down to the 'Escape sequence' table.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In what way is it an ASCII character?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartinBonner: Because it's defined like that. Have a look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Control_characters" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Table of Control Characters</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matthias:  I am pretty sure that Python will map <code>\n</code> to whatever the underlying C implementation uses for <code>\n</code>.  That may be LF, or on older Macs it may be CR.  I have no idea what it is on EBCDIC mainframes, it will be.  Saying that <code>\n</code> is <b>A</b> ASCII character is wrong.  "A special character signifying ... " would be fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">According to the Python documentation the correct wording would be: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The meaning of <code>\n</code>is <i>ASCII Linefeed (LF)</i></a>.</span>
