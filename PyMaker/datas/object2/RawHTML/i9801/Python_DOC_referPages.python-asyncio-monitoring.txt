<p>I've a python program which are launching a random number of asyncio coroutine. During the time my program can launch new ones and some of them can exit when they have terminated their work.</p>
<p>I would like to know if it's possible to report, every minute, the number of active coroutine? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You cannot <em>launch a coroutine</em> but could start a new <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#task" rel="nofollow noreferrer">task</a></p>
<p>For retrieving the number of active tasks please use <code>len(asyncio.Task.all_tasks())</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You're right it's the number of tasks not coroutine, it's still confused for me :(  but you're answer is perfect. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Roughly speaking coroutine is an async function but task is async thread.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndrewSvetlov What is meant when docs talk about "number of active tasks"? <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/41029450/4249707">Look's like</a> it's simple incremental counter for all executed tasks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ElRuso what docs are you talking about? <code>Task.all_tasks()</code> returns a set  of tasks created by the loop. Please note: finished but still not garbage collected tasks are counted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndrewSvetlov Tnx, I got answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/41039173/4249707">here</a>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.Task.all_tasks" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Doc's</a> have not enough examples</span>
