<p>Hey community I'm new in python and I have a question may be this have been answered before but I want to know if that's possible</p>
<p>I have this python code: </p>
<pre><code>import re

file = open("address.txt","r")
content = file.read()
file.close()
content = content.split('LAN ')[1:]
dic = {}
for lan in content:
    dic[int(lan[0])] = lan[1:] 



def address(lan_index):
    address = re.findall('address\s(.*?)\s',dic[lan_index] )
    print 'LAN',lan_index,":",address
    return address
address(1)
</code></pre>
<p>where my output is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LAN 1 : ['192.168.0.0']</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it possible to remove <code>['']</code> and print only the <code>address</code>?
for example something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LAN 1 : 192.168.0.0 &lt;--- That's the output I want.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>address</code> is the result of a <code>re.findall</code> so it comes in the form of a <code>list</code>. If you want the (only) result that is supposed to be returned take the first item from that list:</p>
<pre><code>print 'LAN', lan_index, ":", address[0]
</code></pre>
<p>I would also suggest to make sure an address was found:</p>
<pre><code>def address(lan_index):
    address = re.findall('address\s(.*?)\s',dic[lan_index] )
    if len(address) &gt; 0:
        print 'LAN', lan_index, ":", address[0]
    else:
        print 'No address was found!'
    return address
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Try printing <code>address[0]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>re.findall()</code> returns a list of all the matches (as far as I know), since it found out only one, it returned list with one value. You need to access it as @Evert wrote.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, consider using <code>match = re.search(...)</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search" rel="nofollow noreferrer">(doc)</a> instead of <code>re.findall(...)</code> if you're only interested in one match instead of every match. You can extract the matched string using <code>address = match.group()</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match.group" rel="nofollow noreferrer">(doc)</a> if a match was found.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you a lot Uriel, worked exactaly as expected, thanks for your time :)!. Also thank you @suspicousdog I'll read a lot more about it.</span>
