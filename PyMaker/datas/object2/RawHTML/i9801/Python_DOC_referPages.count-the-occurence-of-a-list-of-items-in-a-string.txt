<p>How will I be able to count the number of time a list of items are repeated in a string. For example how can I search through string and check the number of times this list has been repeated in string?</p>
<pre><code>list = ('+','-','*','/')
string = "33+33-33*33/33"
</code></pre>

<p>Firstly, don't use a name like <code>list</code>, it masks the built-in name <code>list</code> [See: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Built-in Methods</a>] and that can lead to some subtle bugs.</p>
<p>After that, there's ways to do this. The crucial thing to have in mind is that <em>objects</em> like strings come along with a plethora of <em>methods</em> [See: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=string%20methods#string-methods" rel="nofollow noreferrer">String Methods</a>] that act on them. One of these methods is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=string%20methods#str.count" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.count(sub)</code></a> which counts the number of times <code>sub</code> occurs in your string.</p>
<p>So, creating a count for every element in <code>lst</code> could be done by using a <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>lst = ('+','-','*','/')
string = "33+33-33*33/33"
for i in lst:
    print("Item ", i, " occured", str(string.count(i)), "times")
</code></pre>
<p><code>str(string.count(i))</code> transforms the integer result of <code>string.count</code> to an <code>str</code> object so it can be printed by <code>print</code>.</p>
<p>This prints out:</p>
<pre><code>Item  +  occured 1 times
Item  -  occured 1 times
Item  *  occured 1 times
Item  /  occured 1 times
</code></pre>
<p>After getting more accustomed to Python you could use a comprehension to create a list of the results and supply them to <code>print</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print(*["Item {} occured {} times".format(x, string.count(x)) for x in lst], sep='\n')
</code></pre>
<p>which prints a similar result.</p>
<p>Finally, make sure you <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read the Tutorial</a> available on the Python documentation website, it'll help you get acquainted with the language.</p>
