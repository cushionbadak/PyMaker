<p>I use python for programing, and i wonder how to extract a number by locating a specific word. For example, StoneA weights 10kg moves with speed 20m/s, StoneB weights 30kg moves with speed 40m/s. I know i can use re.findall to extract numbers. But if i just want to extract numbers relate with speed (which is 40 and 20). Is there a way to do it by locating the word "speed" or "m/s"</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.findall</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'StoneA weights 10kg moves with speed 20m/s, StoneB weights 30kg moves with speed 40m/s'
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall(r'(\d+)m/s', s)
['20', '40']
</code></pre>
<p>Regular expression <code>(\d+)m/s</code> captures one or more digits immediately followed by <code>m/s</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You will be needing regex for that. <code>re</code> document: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/re.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why don't you regex for units like this <code>re.findall("(\d)(?:m/s|speed)", string)</code>?</span>
