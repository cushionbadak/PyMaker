<p>Or iterate the function some times, provided it is by chance a fixed point iteration</p>
<pre><code>from math import log

func = lambda x : 10*log(x,2)**2 + 1000
x=1000
for _ in range(15): x = func(x); print "%.12f" % x

<p>IMHO:</p>
<p>This is what you are looking for based on this equation:function N = 10 * (Log2 N)^2+1000</p>
<pre><code>import math
def funct_try(x):
    return (10*(math.log(x,2)**2)+1000)

funct_try(100)

<p>It is hard to understand what you actually want.Also the code you wrote doesn't seem to have anything to do with the problem stated in your question.
Assuming you are having problem to understand how to use the log function:</p>
<p>lets say you want to calculate log function with base 2 then:</p>
<pre><code>import math
print(math.log(8,2))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>3.0
</code></pre>
<p>Assuming that helped.NOw,let's try your function;it should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import math
def function_name(N):
    print(10*(math.pow(math.log(N,2),2))+1000)

function_name(110) #here I called the above function with a value 100
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>1459.8683956421526

<span class="comment-copy">The "function" you wrote doesn't seem to have anything to do with the problem stated in your question. I think you need to learn a few Python fundamentals first. There is no need to initialize variables, for example. And you don't need an <code>if</code> statement here but a simple assignment. What you do need is a value to compute (<code>N</code> in your example). Check out the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the function I wrote is the simplified version of the function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like the inverse of the function, but it would need at least another variable (<code>x</code> will never be equal to <code>2 ** (((x-1000)/10)^(1/2))</code>), and you'd need a strategy of finding a matching value for <code>N</code>. Something iterative perhaps, if your goal is to solve this problem without using <code>math.log()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why did  you take 100 as input? is that the answer for x?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes 100 is an input, and yes x is 100 so function gives value of the function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">did that solve x? why did you put 110 by the way?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes it solves the equation.Like I said ,110 is just a sample value to demonstrate you.</span>
