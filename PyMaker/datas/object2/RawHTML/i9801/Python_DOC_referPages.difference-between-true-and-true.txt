<p>I was practising a python related problem at Hackerrank. I am a total newbie to python. The Problem was to simply write a function, which checks if a year is leap year or not according to the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>I looked in the discussions tab, where I found out the answer, I decided to not to copy up the code and instead I wrote the code after understanding it.</p>
<p>So I wrote it this way:</p>
<pre><code>if year%4 == 0 and (year%100 != 0 or year%400 == 0):
    leap = true;
</code></pre>
<p>When I ran the tests, It ended up with two failed tests and two timed out tests. So I checked the solution in the discussions tab again and changed my code to:</p>
<pre><code>if year%4 == 0 and (year%100 != 0 or year%400 == 0):
    leap = True
</code></pre>
<p>When I ran this code, all my test cases passed, without any errors.</p>
<p>Does python have only 'True' and not 'true'?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance. :) </p>

<p>True is capitalised because Python built in constants are capitalised: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html</a></p>
<p>"true" would create an error, as the program will be looking for a non-existant variable called true.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The difference is that <code>True</code> is the keyword and <code>true</code> is not. The flag is case sensitive. It is always <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>, not <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python is case sensitive and strongly typed.</p>
<p>'true' is not the same as 'TRUE'</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Python only has <code>True</code>. Did you check the Python documentation? The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#boolean-values" rel="nofollow noreferrer">standard types section</a> would have answered this very quickly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Martijn true, from python 2.3, before only 1 and 0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AriGold: 2.3 is now ancient history. HackerRank certainly doesn't support it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">now is relative but yeah</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters, Okay, Thank you I should have looked up the documentation, also thank you for sending me the link to it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could do <code>true = True</code> though. Or for even more fun: <code>true = False; false = True</code> :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @dahui for explaining it, python keeps getting interesting for me :)</span>
