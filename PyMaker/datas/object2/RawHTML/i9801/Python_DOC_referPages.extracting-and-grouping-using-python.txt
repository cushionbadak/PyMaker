<p>Below is part of a log file, which is logging individual requests over some period of time. Write a python program to generate a report of the total number of steps walked  per customer. I have a log file which contains the below lines.</p>
<pre><code>01-01-2012 01:13:36 ygyfyeic  vyeywq Customerid:1231 walked 245 steps
01-09-2013 01:18:34 gghjjhkl  fyuftf Customerid:56789 walked 678 steps

<p>I am able to extract Customer id and number of steps in a different lists, but I am stuck at creating a report like, number of steps taken by each customer.</p>
<p>Note: date keep changes, and no.of customer ids are not same.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you have already extracted the data into two separate lists, lets call them <code>ids</code> and <code>steps</code>.  We can print out a report by doing the following:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(ids)):
    print('Customer number %s took %s steps' % (ids[i], steps[i]))
</code></pre>
<p>You could alternatively use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zip function</a>, which puts together two or more lists into a list of tuples containing the corresponding elements of each:</p>
<pre><code>for cid, csteps in zip(ids, steps):
    print('Customer number %s took %s steps' % (cid, csteps))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use pandas and dataframe,</p>
<p>From this <strong>i am able to extract Customer id and no of steps in a different lists</strong> i assume you have customerid and steps in 2 diff list. </p>
<p>import pandas as pd</p>
<pre><code>cid = [1231,56789,1231,1678]
steps=[1,2,3,4]

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'cid': cid,
    'steps':steps
})

print(df.groupby(['cid']).sum())
</code></pre>
<p>o/p</p>
<pre><code>       steps
cid         
1231       4
1678       4
56789      2
