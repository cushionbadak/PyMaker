<p>I just noticed Python 3.2 was removed from the drop down selector in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Docs</a>. I have a framework using Python 3.3, so I'd like to know when it'll share the same fate, and move to a newer version before this happens.</p>
<p>Is there an official guide on how long Python <code>3.x</code> gets support, backports, etc.? I couldn't find any information about Python release lifecycle on Python's home page or via search engines.</p>

<p>Yes, you could look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/devguide/#status-of-python-branches" rel="nofollow noreferrer">table in the Pythons Developer Guide</a> for most releases. Specifically <code>Python 3.3</code> will have security fixes until  2017-09-29.   </p>
<p>Additionally, there also exists appropriate <code>PEP</code>s (google-able or from the devguide table) for each branch where a lifespan section specifies these. For <code>3.3</code> in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0398/#lifespan" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>PEP 398</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>3.3</code> will receive bugfix updates approximately every 4-6 months for approximately 18 months. After the release of <code>3.4.0</code> final, a final <code>3.3</code> bugfix update will be released. After that, security updates (source only) will be released until 5 years after the release of <code>3.3</code> final, which will be September 2017.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each Python release gets a Release Schedule PEP which includes information about the planned lifespan. For 3.3: <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0398/#id11" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0398/#id11</a></p>
