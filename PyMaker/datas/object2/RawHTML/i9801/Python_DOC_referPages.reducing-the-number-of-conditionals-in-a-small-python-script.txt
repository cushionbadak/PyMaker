<p>I have been developing a small program.
It works perfectly how it is but I want to make the code a bit smaller.</p>
<pre><code>import time, math 
name= input("Enter Your Name: ")
age= int(input("Enter Your Age: "))
end= "th"
if age == 3 or age == 13 or age == 23 or age == 33 or age == 43 or age == 53 or age == 63 or age == 73 or age == 83 or age == 93:
 end= "rd"

if age == 2 or age == 22 or age == 32 or age == 42 or age == 52 or age == 62     or age == 72 or age == 82 or age == 92:
 end= "nd"

print ("Your Name Is "+ name + ", You Are " + str(age) + " Years Old.")
print ("Hi " + name + ", Happy " + str(age) + end + " birthday!")
time.sleep(5)
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to have an easier way to change the 'end' to other values without having to write them all, can I have it start at 3 then do it for everything 10 more than three.</p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex" rel="nofollow noreferrer">modulo operator</a>:</p>
<pre><code>if age % 10 == 3:
    end = "rd"
elif age % 10 == 2:
    end = "nd"
</code></pre>
<p>Or use a dict:</p>
<pre><code>ends = {2: "nd", 3: "rd"}
end = ends[age % 10]
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use a default:</p>
<pre><code>ends = {1: "st", 2: "nd", 3: "rd"}
end = ends.get(age % 10, "th)

<p>Extract the digit at tenth's place. Then it's straightforward. Though this question belongs to the <code>codereview</code> counterpart of SO.</p>

<p>Thanks For All Of It Guys,</p>
<p>I have also found another flaw and fixed it, here is my current code.
Thanks.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please write a title that describes better your problem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should look around the site to see how to write a descriptive title - your current one isn't particularly clear. Also, look into the modulo operator in Python (hint: you can replace your first check with <code>age % 10 == 3</code>).</span>
