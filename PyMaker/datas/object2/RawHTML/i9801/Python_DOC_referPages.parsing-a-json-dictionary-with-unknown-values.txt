<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to deal with a dictionary in JSON, looks like following:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "Parameters": {
        "IP": "192.168.1.40",
        "TIMEOUT": 900,
        "mode": 0
    },

    "Device": {
        "sector01": {
            "nodes": ["node01", "node02"] 
        },
        "sector02": {
            "nodes": ["node01"]
        },
        "sector03": {
            "nodes": ["node01","node02","node03"]       
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Assume I have no info about the how many sectors and nodes are present and I want to know the number of sectors (and how many nodes per sector).
I was able to find the total no of sectors by :</p>
<pre><code>len(data["Device"])
</code></pre>
<p>But, the total no of nodes per sector is more important in my case. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>for-loop</code> to get every "sector" (it doesn't matter how many you have sectors) and then you can get "nodes" in sector and check <code>len()</code></p>
<pre><code>for key, val in data['Device'].items(): 
    print(key, len(val["nodes"]))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import json

your_json = """{

<p>I suggest study more here:

<span class="comment-copy">So you want to sum over the length of the nodes value for each map in Device? What's stopping you from doing that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This looks like just a lack of understanding of how dictionaries work. Try: <code>len(data["Device"]["sector03"]["nodes"])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">use <code>for-loop</code> to get sector (one-by-one) and you don't have to know how many stectors you have - and then you can get <code>"nodes"</code> in sector to check its <code>len()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>for key, val in data['Device'].items(): print(key, len(val["nodes"]))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@furas I was trying to use key() but your line worked like a charm, thx a lot</span>
