<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a file in which among other lines there are certain lines which start are like as follows</p>
<pre><code>*SOLID SECTION, ELSET=EB1, MATERIAL=Alu
*SOLID SECTION, ELSET=EB42, MATERIAL=Alu
....
....
</code></pre>
<p>Their distinct feature being starting with *SOLID
I would like to get the number in the same line after EB so first iteration should give 1 and second should give 42</p>
<p>what I used is</p>
<pre><code>for line in inputFile:
 if line.startswith('*SOLID'):
  trial=line 
  array = line.split(' ')
  target= array[2]
  ID=target[-2:]
  print ID
</code></pre>
<p>it would give me 1, and 2, as output. I can of-course increase the -2 to -3 but the comma would still be there and when I have 1 or any number less than 10 as the last number it would also include B with that. Any suggestions to this? I could also use ',' as delimiter for the problem of separation of number from alphabet would remain!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>1st, get the needed column with split then get the number with regex</p>
<pre><code>import re
line = '*SOLID SECTION, ELSET=EB1, MATERIAL=Alu'
id = line.split()[2].split('=')[-1] # this get EB1
id = re.search('\d+', id).group()   # this get 1
</code></pre>
<p>or using regex alone</p>
<pre><code>import re
line = '*SOLID SECTION, ELSET=EB1, MATERIAL=Alu'
id = re.search('(\S+\s+){2}\w+\=\w*(\d+)', line).group(2) # this get 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use a regex as well: <code>re.findall('=EB(\d+)', s)[0]</code></span>

<span class="comment-copy">@HamadHassan <code>s</code> is a line, not the whole file. You can still get what you want.</span>
