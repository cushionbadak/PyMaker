<p>Consider the following typescript:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'a'
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(s, bytes)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(s, str)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(s, unicode)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(s.decode('utf-8'), unicode)
True
</code></pre>
<p>How come <code>s</code> is both a <code>str</code> and a <code>bytes</code>? Is one of those a descendant of the other one?</p>
<p>How did I run into it? I was trying to find description of <code>decode</code> method in the docs. I couldn't find it for <code>str</code>, but was able for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>bytes</code></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are looking at the wrong documentation.</p>
<p>This equivalence is only true in Python 2.7. There, <code>bytes</code> was introduced as an alias to <code>str</code> in order to ease migration to Python 3.</p>
<p>In Python 3, <code>str</code> is what was previously called <code>unicode</code>, <code>bytes</code> is the type that was previously called <code>str</code>.</p>
<p>The documentation for <code>str.decode</code> for Python 2 is <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.decode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(s, bytes) False</code> python 3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Added the Python 2.x tag, as this seems only to be the case in Python 2. Also, <code>bytes == str</code> yields <code>True</code> in Python 2.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Indeed. I mainly deal with Python 3, so I instinctively looked in that part of the documentation.</span>
