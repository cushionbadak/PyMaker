<p>I am quite new to python, and I haven't figured out yet how to solve my quit simple problem. I did some research, but either I did not found or I didn't understand what to do with it... My question is :
How to know if there is an instanciation of a class in a container such as a list ; 
I want to do something like</p>
<pre><code>if class in list :
</code></pre>
<p>I know this is a really simple question but to be honest I can't find the proper syntax to make it work :/ </p>

<p>You can use the <code>isinstance</code> built in function to test if an object is an instantiation of a <em>certain</em> <code>class</code>, and the <code>any</code> built in function to test if any of the members of an iterable match your condition:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class A:
        pass

&gt;&gt;&gt; stuff = [1,2,A()]
&gt;&gt;&gt; any(isinstance(a, A) for a in stuff)
True
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>FYI:  <strong>all</strong> objects in Python are instantiations of some kind of <code>class</code> (even <code>class</code>es themselves!), so there's no point to seeing if an object in a <code>list</code> is an instantiation of <em>any</em> class, since everything in the <code>list</code> will be.</p>

<p>Use the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>isinstance()</code></a> function.</p>
<pre><code>flag = False
for obj in your_list:
    if isinstance(obj, class):
        flag = True
        break
</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre><code>flag = any([isinstance(obj, class) for obj in your_list])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>class</code> is a keyword in Python, don't use it as an identifier.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you want to find out? Python code usually follows the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-eafp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">EAFP</a> style.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm  see what you mean, I meant <i>instanciation of this class</i> by class, but  thanks to you guys it works now !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No need for the square brackets in you <code>any</code> call.</span>
