<p>I want to create a program which will save data to a text file and it should create a text file everytime my program runs.
is there any way to do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try something like this:</p>
<pre><code># this will create a file in the current directory 
# from where your are executing your python script
f = open('somefile.txt', 'w')
# write some data into your file
f.write('some string\n')
# then close your file
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>This is the simplest possible script which will create a file and write <code>some string</code> in it, when you run it. But this is very primitive way of working with files. </p>
<p>There is another way which is considered as a best practice while working with files. And it is to use <code>with</code> context manager as below: </p>
<pre><code>with open('somefile.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('your stuff')
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it is shorter, cleaner and it lacks <code>closing the file</code> part because the <code>with</code> context manager does it for you, so you don't need to bother about closing files. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Many ways to do that.Tried googling?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">do you want different name for thefile?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A simple Google search for "python create file" would reveal some helpful things, including the <code>open()</code> function you're looking for.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, but what I thought that if someone is just starting to get around with files in python, they need to see the explicit process first. With <code>with</code> context manager he can't see the closing the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The explanation "this will create a file in the directory where your python code lives" is wrong. The file will be created in the current working directory which might or might not be same as the directory with the script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Graipher for suggestions. I've improved the answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Matthias I've fixed that.</span>
