That is what keeps happening when I try to run ANY script on my computer, that isnt executed inside pycharm. If I try to run the exact same code inside Pycharm, it works perfectly fine. </p>
<p>Here is the error code ran in cmd:   </p>
<pre><code>python test.py
</code></pre>
<p>File "test.py", line 86
SyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\xf8' in file test.py on line 86, but no encoding declared; see <a href="http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/</a> for details

<p>Alright so I figured out that it was because I had some "Not english letter" such as; (æ, ø, å) </p>
<p>But the problem is the script shall search for a web element with the text: "
"armbåndsure". And since it wont recognize the letter, how do I fix this error?</p>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code> emner = browser.find_element_by_link_text('Armbåndsure og lommeure')
</code></pre>
<p>The code error of that line that I cant get around since its necesarry for me to have that "å" in my script:</p>
<pre><code>  File "test.py", line 96
SyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\xe5' in file test.py on line 96, but no encoding declared; see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details
</code></pre>

<p>At this point any time you say "my script doesnt even have anything to do with unicode" you are almost certainly wrong. Your code file is most likely saved as UTF-8 therefore making your script itself unicode and non-English characters should work <em>assuming they are all encoded right</em>. If you haven't already, you should read the Python docs on unicode support (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python 2x</a>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 3x</a>).</p>
<p>Since you say the script runs in PyCharm, likely it is detecting and setting the encoding properly but in other contexts the interpter is guessing incorrectly. </p>
<p>If you can get the file open in a good code editor with all characters appearing, try saving the file explicitly as UTF-8 and see if that corrects the encoding errors. Depending on your Python version you may also need to set the encoding explicitly in your file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">So... what character is on line 86 of test.py?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"># Første bogstav i 2. object i list (brand) skal være stort.  Ah, maybe its because of "ø", why didnt I check that. Ill try to change all none english letters and see if it works.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But its just that it checks on a website for a name which contains a "å": Here is my code:_____________________________________________________________  emner = browser.find_element_by_link_text('Armbåndsure og lommeure')</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at the question again under "update"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Check my updated question, you are right, I was totally retarded for a second forgot I had "æ,ø,å" in my script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since you're worried about an encoding issue within the script, I suggest you read the HOWTO for the right version of Python (or both) and if you are still confused write up new question about that section of the script.  Include the version of Python you're using as there are differences between 2x and 3x around character encodings.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What should I search for? You told me to read: "the HOWTO" + right version of python..  I am not sure what to read to be honost. if you could provide me with a link please, that would make my day. Thanks in advance! :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Links are at the end of the first paragraph of my answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Man there is too much to read, and by quickly skimming the text, I can't spot the guide on how to make a script accept. none enligsh letters such as "å" If you dont mind, could you please provide me witht he answer. (If you know it)  I only got this one line in my whole code that contains a none english letter. which is "å". How can I unicode that into my script? No I can't just delete it from the script. Thanks in advance! :) ~~The code line is in the question above under update~~</span>
