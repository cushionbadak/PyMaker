<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code> name = input('Enter your name please: ')
 while name != str:

 while ss != int:

</code></pre>
<p>So I have this basic program that asks the user for his name and SS# and I wanted to do so the user can't input a str or a float where he is supposed to input an int. I tried this but it'll just loop forever because the If statement is checking to see if the input is the data type str or int, How can I do it to check if the variable is an int or a str?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>name != str</code> does not do what you think it does. The result of input() is always a string. If you only want to get certain types of strings, then you have to validate them yourself. For checking if something only contains letters or only contains numbers you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>name.isalpha()</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isnumeric" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>name.isnumeric()</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you need something more complicated than what these or othe other builtin string methods provide, then you'll probably need to write a regular expression or other custom validation code.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're trying to compare the value with a <code>type</code>. You should instead store the name and check if has only letters (<code>.isalpha()</code>) and try a type casting on the security number. If it fails, it's not a valid input. Using <code>isnumeric()</code> for the SSN is also an option. Something like:</p>
<pre><code>name = input('Enter your name please: ')
while not name.isalpha():
    name = input('Please enter only letters for your name: ')

ss = input('Enter your Social Security Number: ')
try:
    int(ss)
    valid_ss = True
except ValueError:
    valid_ss = False

while not valid_ss:
    ss = input('Please enter only numbers for your social security number:')
    try:
        int(ss)
        valid_ss = True
    except ValueError:
        valid_ss = False
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>name = input('Enter your name please: ')
while not name.isalpha():
    name = input('Please enter only letters for your name: ')

ss = input('Enter your Social Security Number: ')
while not ss.isnumeric():
    ss = input('Please enter only numbers for your social security number:')
</code></pre>
