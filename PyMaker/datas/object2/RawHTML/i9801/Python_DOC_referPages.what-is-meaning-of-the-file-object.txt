<p>In python to open a file we write <code>with open(filename) as f:</code> or <code>f=open(filename)</code>. Can anyone please give more knowledge of what is <strong>f</strong> and what it will do?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you write <code>F = open(filename)</code> in Python, you are saving the object returned by the call to <code>open()</code> on <code>filename</code> into a variable.  The variable is called <code>F</code>, in your case, but it could be <code>file</code> or <code>puppy</code> if you wanted.  </p>
<p>The <code>open</code> function in Python returns a Python file object (Python glossary on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-file-object" rel="nofollow noreferrer">file object</a>). So after that declaration, <code>F</code> is a file object - but I think your question was more about whether <code>F</code> was a Python keyword that contributed to the code, and I think you can see now that the answer to that is "No, it is an arbitrary variable name" basically.  It is not quite an <em>arbitrary</em> variable name - people use <code>F</code> a lot (so I can see why you thought it was a keyword), but it's used frequently in this instatiation because people are thinking 'F' for 'file'.  </p>
<p>You can learn more about the <code>open</code> function over here in its <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>f</strong> is file <code>object</code> that contain the <code>state of the file</code></p>
<p>few methods: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>f.mode - The mode attribute of a file object tells you in which mode
  the file was opened.</p>
<p>f.name - The name attribute of a file object tells you the name of the
  file that the file object has open.</p>
<p>f.closed - The closed attribute of a file object indicates whether the
  object has a file open or not. In this case, the file is still open
  (closed is False).</p>
<p>f.close() - To close a file, call the close method of the file object.</p>
<p>f.seek(0) - The seek method of a file object moves to another position
  in the open file</p>
<p>f.tell() - The tell method of a file object tells you your current
  position in the open file</p>
<p>f.read() - T0 read the content of file</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It means that you are assigning to a variable named F a file object wrapper. It's done to make further operations on that same instance file object.</p>
