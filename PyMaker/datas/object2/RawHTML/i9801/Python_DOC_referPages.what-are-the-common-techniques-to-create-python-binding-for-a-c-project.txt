<p>I've seen so many projects written in pure <code>C++</code>, but when the project is done, authors create Python bindings for the project such that users could not only use the tool from command line but also inside python as a library.</p>
<p>I wonder how the Python binding is created?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have several options as you can see in the comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Python / C API.</li>
<li>Boost.Python</li>
<li>Pybind11</li>
</ul>
<p>There is <a href="https://youtu.be/bJq1n4gQFfw" rel="nofollow">a talk</a> on CppCon 2016 about this that can be of interest to you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I have seen good work done to wrap C++ with Python using boost python (<a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_62_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">boost.org/doc/libs/1_62_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html</a>) as well as SWIG (<a href="http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html</a>).  You can also manually write the bindings yourself if desired by using ctypes (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html</a>) but in that case you first need to have a pure C interface to wrap (not C++).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@qexyn, <code>pure C interface to wrap</code>? You mean I cannot have C++ class wrapped?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Only in the case of using python cyptes do you need pure C interface; sorry for confusion.  Boost python and SWIG allow binding to C++ directly so you dont need to write the C code.</span>
