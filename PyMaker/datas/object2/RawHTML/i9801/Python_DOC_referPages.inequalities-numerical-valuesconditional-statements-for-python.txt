<p>I want to make a conditional test for python to check that the value of a given inputted number is equal to or less than 9, and greater than or equal to 0.</p>
<pre><code>number =input( "Please enter a number! :" )
Please enter a number! :23
&gt;&gt;&gt; edited_number=float(number)
&gt;&gt;&gt; if edited_number &gt;0 &lt;9:
    print ("Entered value greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 9!")
</code></pre>
<p>I get a printed message saying:</p>
<p><strong>entered value greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 9!</strong></p>
<p>Which obviously is wrong, because the entered value is 23. That then suggests to me that the &lt;9 condition has been ignored for some reason. </p>
<p>Is there some way for me to have a numerical range with a single if? Or will only a single condition be interpreted per if statement?</p>
<p>PS: I am using Python 3.6.0b if that is of any relevance.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>"<code>if edited_number &gt; 0 &lt; 9</code>"</p>
<p>This doesn't work in python.
You need to specify the variable twice like this:</p>
<p><code>if edited_number &gt; 0 and edited_number &lt; 9</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can write</p>
<pre><code>if not (0 &lt;= edited_number &lt;= 9):
   print ("Entered value greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 9!")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That chained expression isn't doing what you think it does. What you want is:</p>
<pre><code>0 &lt;= edited_number &lt;= 9
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you're not comfortable with chained conditionals you can use the verbose form:</p>
<pre><code>0 &lt;= edited_number and edited_number &lt;= 9
</code></pre>
<p>The expression:</p>
<pre><code>edited_number &gt; 0 &lt; 9
</code></pre>
<p>Is the same as </p>
<pre><code>edited_number &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; 9
</code></pre>
<p>Which evaluates to <code>True</code> when <code>edited_number</code> is 23. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Isn't your suggested expression the <i>opposite</i> of what is desired?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ScottHunter Good eye on the typo</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Moses Koledoyle; can I clarify with you, are you saying my grammar was wrong, rather than the coding? :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@apronedsamurai I'll say the conditional expression was not properly written - your coding. The variable should be in the middle. If you're not comfortable with chained conditionals, better to use the verbose form.</span>
