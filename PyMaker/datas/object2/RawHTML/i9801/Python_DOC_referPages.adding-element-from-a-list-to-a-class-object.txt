<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've got a class <code>Animal</code>, with attributes <code>Name</code>, <code>Age</code>, <code>Gender</code> and <code>Species</code>. I've got a list with split elements like this:</p>
<pre><code>li = ['George', '23', 'Monkey', 'Male', 'Mike', '31', 'Racoon', 'Male']
</code></pre>
<p>Now I want to take four elements at a time, and add to new <code>Animal</code> objects.
I really can't figure out how to. Can someone help me with this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This may help you get started:</p>
<pre><code>class Animal(object):
    def __init__(self, Name, Age, Species, Gender):
        self.name = Name
        self.age = Age
        self.species = Species
        self.gender = Gender

li = ['George', '23', 'Monkey', 'Male', 'Mike', '31', 'Racoon', 'Male']

first_animal = Animal(*li[0:4])
second_animal = Animal(*li[4:])

print("""
First Animal is:
gender: {0.gender}
age: {0.age}
name: {0.name}
species: {0.species}""".format(first_animal))
</code></pre>
<p>Outputs:</p>
<pre><code>First Animal is:
gender: Male
age: 23
name: George
species: Monkey
</code></pre>
<p>A brief explanation, "chunking of the list" can be done many ways, I just chose to use the <code>*</code>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">splat operator</a>, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html?highlight=slicing#slicings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">slice</a> the contents.</p>
<p>Instantiating objects from the class was borrowed from this tutorial <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex40.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>, bottom of the page "A First Class Example".</p>
<p>I didn't put these new class objects into a new list, but as everything in python is an object, and you know how to create lists as you did in your question, I'll leave that trivial part out.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe well for starters the "chunking" of the list. I've read the other posts as well, but I can't make them work. The next step is also to put these new class objects into a new list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then ask <b>one specific question</b>. You say you've read other posts but <i>"can't make them work"</i> - which posts? What did you try? What precisely went wrong? <i>Then</i> you have a decent question.

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your very courteous and thoughtful edit @Tadhg McDonald-Jensen, ;) is much clearer and looks better!</span>
