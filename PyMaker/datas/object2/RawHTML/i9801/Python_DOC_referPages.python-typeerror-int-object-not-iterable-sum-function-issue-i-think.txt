<p>The object of the program is to ask the user how many articles of clothing they collected on each day of a 3 day (weekend) clothes drive, average them, do it again for the second weekend, then average the two weekends (clothes per day). </p>
<p>Here is my code: </p>
<pre><code>import math

num_clothes = int() 
weekend_total = int() 
weekend_avg = float() 
total_clothes = int() 
total_avg = float() 
index = int()


index = 1 
while index &lt;= 2: 
    index = 1 
    while index &lt;= 3: 
        num_clothes = int(input("How many articles of clothing did you collect today? ")) 
        index = index + 1

    weekend_total = sum(num_clothes) 
    weekend_avg = weekend_total / 3 
    print("Total Collected:\t", weekend_total) 
    print("Weekend Average:\t", weekend_avg) 
    index = index + 1`1

total_clothes = sum(weekend_total) 
total_avg = total_clothes / 6 
print("Total Number of Clothing Collected:\t", total_clothes) 
print("Average Collected:\t", total_avg)
</code></pre>
<p>And here is the error i keep getting: </p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "G:\ITCS 1140\labs\python\lab 9.py", line 17, in &lt;module&gt;
    weekend_total = sum(num_clothes)
TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to make num_clothes into a list and add all the values of it with sum(num_clothes).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your num_clothes is an variable of type <strong>int</strong> and you are passing this variable as parameter to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sum" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sum function</a></p>
<pre><code>weekend_total = sum(num_clothes)
</code></pre>
<p>You can see by the documentation that, if you want to sum properly, you need an iterator passed as parameters.</p>
<p>If you want to read a list from the user, try to change your input to this:</p>
<pre><code>    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]  

Example
-------

    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    3 4 5
    &gt;&gt;&gt; a
    [3, 4, 5]
    &gt;&gt;&gt; sum(a)
    12
    &gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4663306/get-a-list-of-numbers-as-input-from-the-user">Source</a></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can leave your code as it is and change num_clothes to list(). Then, after read the input, append the result to the list: </p>
<pre><code>num_clothes = list()

...

num_clothes.append(int(input(...))

...

weekend_total = sum(num_clothes)
</code></pre>

<p><code>sum()</code> is a function that adds all objects of an iterable object such as a list</p>
<pre><code>list = [1,2,3]

<p>either change <code>num_clothes</code> to a list by using <code>.append()</code> and adding an integer to the list every iteration of the while loop</p>
<p>or just make <code>num_clothes</code> a total by doing <code>+= int(input(..etc))</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">so i just tried doing the second one and i got the error message:  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "G:\ITCS 1140\labs\python\lab 9.py", line 16, in &lt;module&gt;     num_clothes.append(int(input("How many articles of clothing did you collect today? "))) AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'append'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you change your num_clothes variable type to list() instead of int() ? I have updated the example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hooray you fixed it!!!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice. You can now accept (and mark as useful) my answer or Padskiiz's answer. <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5234/how-does-accepting-an-answer-work" title="how does accepting an answer work">meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5234/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do I do the append thing? like num_clothes.append(what goes here)? Or if I want to make it a total would I just print out num_clothes as the total and not have a total variable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The integer you want to append to the list, so for every iteration of the while loop do num_clothes.append(int(input("how many clothes: ")))</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would also suggest using raw_input() over input()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it says "int object has no attribute 'append'"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you initialise the variable instead of num_clothes = int() make it num_clothes = [] this creates a blank list</span>
