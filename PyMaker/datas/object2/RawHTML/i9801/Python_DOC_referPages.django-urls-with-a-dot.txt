<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to match a url like: <code>/api/1.0/page/1</code></p>
<p>I've got my main <code>urls.py</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^api/1.0/', include('api_v1.urls')),
]
</code></pre>
<p>and then in my <code>api_v1/urls.py</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^page/(?P&lt;page_id&gt;[0-9]{4})/', views.page),
]
</code></pre>
<p>I feel like it should be simple but I can't get it to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your regex enforces 4 character page ids.  But your page id is just <code>1</code>.  Perhaps this pattern would work better:</p>
<pre><code>r'^page/(?P&lt;page_id&gt;[0-9]+)/'
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The URL patterns are regexes, so you'll have to escape special regex characters, like the dot. Try <code>r'^api/1\.0/'</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It might be worth your while to read up on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Python documentation on regular expressions</a>, in particular what special characters exist.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've tried escaping the dot @Evert (I'm reasonably good with regex). When I escape it Django lists the url patters as <code>^api/1\.0/ ^page/(?P&lt;page_id&gt;[0-9]{4})/</code> (notice the space)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Egg on my face. You're spot on - I was looking the the wrong place.</span>
