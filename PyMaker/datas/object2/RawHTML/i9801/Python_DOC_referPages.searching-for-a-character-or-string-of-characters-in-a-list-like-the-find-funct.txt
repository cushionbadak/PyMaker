<p>My first post here.
I'd like to create a search function, searching a list for any raw_input entered.
So far, I've been able to call a path on computer and append each item to a list.
I know I can list.index() for a complete file name, but I'd like it to search for
simply any character(s) one might want to input.</p>
<p>Here's what I've got so far:::</p>
<pre><code>import os

list1 = []

x = "/Users/User/temp"

vec = os.listdir(x)

for p in vec:
    list1.append(p)

for line in list1:
    print line

o = raw_input("search&gt;&gt;&gt; ")

print list.index(o)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, with this code, the filename has to be typed in exactly...
So, it'll take my path(users/user/temp) and make a list from it, search
the list for the filename and return the index at which it lies.</p>
<p>How can I search for say.. (you) in the list and bring up a result that
might be (youarewonderful.txt).</p>
<p>Thanks, I'm very new to Python, so any insight or code improvements are welcome
as well.</p>

<p>This gives a list of indices:</p>
<pre><code>[i for i, x in enumerate(vec) if "you" in x]
</code></pre>
<p>This is called a list comprehension, and it uses the <code>enumerate</code> function to keep track of the indices.  If you aren't familiar with these, I recommend the official python tutorial <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>

<p>I've got a lead!</p>
<p>Next, I added:::</p>
<pre><code>for p in vec:
    if 'yo' in p:
        print p
        print list1.index(p)
</code></pre>
<p>Sorry Patrick, this is more along the lines of what I wanted to do.  Thanks anyways!  -although I don't quite get what you were getting at.  I'd like to know, though.</p>
<p>Here is completed program, don't know how I got here:::</p>
<pre><code>import os
list1 = []
x = "/Users/User/temp"
vec = os.listdir(x)

for p in vec:
    list1.append(p)

for line in list1:
    print line

b = raw_input('search for item in list/path&gt;&gt;&gt; ')

for p in vec:
    if str(b) in p:
        print p
        print list1.index(p)
</code></pre>
<p>Woo Hoo

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! BUT  - Still working on this... not getting very far.  I feel like enumerate just provides the index with the entry.  How does this help me search?  Because of the 'if "you" in x' ? And then, how do I make it's index print?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>enumerate</code> returns tuples of <code>(index, item)</code> So the item in the list is <code>x</code> and its index is <code>i</code>.  Then you can check the contents of <code>x</code> and only keep the index `ii</span>
<span class="comment-copy">check out my answer, Patrick... any improvements would be welcome.  -thanks</span>
