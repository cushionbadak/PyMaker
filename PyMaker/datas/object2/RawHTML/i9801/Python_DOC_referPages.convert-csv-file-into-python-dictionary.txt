<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I want to convert <code>A,B,24</code> type CSV file into a dictionary having format like <code>{'A':{'B':24}}</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For an <code>input.csv</code> CSV file holding:</p>
<pre><code>A,B,24
</code></pre>
<p>This could be done as follows:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

my_dict = {}

with open('input.csv') as f_input:
    for row in csv.reader(f_input):
        my_dict[row[0]] = {row[1] : row[2]}

print my_dict
</code></pre>
<p>Giving you:</p>
<pre><code>{'A': {'B': '24'}}
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know what a A,B,24 type csv file means. Pandas has a nice read csv method, though</span>

Did you find the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code> module</a> in the standard library yet? Should this happen for every row? Don't answer in the comments, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/40799687/edit">edit</a> your question to include this information.</span>
