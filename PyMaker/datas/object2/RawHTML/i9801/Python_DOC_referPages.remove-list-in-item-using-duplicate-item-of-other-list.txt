<p>I want to remove the repeating day(11) at the same time its value in time.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter        
#identify repeating day in dex number duplicate
dup = [i for key in (key for key, count in Counter(day).items() if count &gt; 1) for i, x in enumerate(day) if x == key]
</code></pre>
<p>I managed to find the index of the duplicate using the above code then I remove the other except the last occurrence of the duplicate then appended by the code below</p>
<pre><code>for x in dup[:-1]:
   time.pop(x)
   day.pop(x)
   day2.append(adlaw)
   time2.append(time)

<p>If you are trying to do what @Keiwan suggested, then consider creating a new list rather than removing unneeded values. Removing an element from a list runtime complexity is O(n), while appending an item to a list is usually of O(1).</p>
<p>The right solution, therefore, would be - </p>
<ul>
<li><p>having a set of "already used days", initialized to be empty</p></li>
<li><p>having a list of new times, initialized to be empty</p></li>
<li><p>running over the list of days</p></li>
<li><p>for each day, check if it appears in the "already used"; if it is - skip it. If it is not - add it to that set, and append the appropriate time to "new times".</p></li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">Please <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/40738547/edit">edit</a> your question and add the code you've tried. Does it work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am confused <i>"how to remove the list item in Time using duplicate value of Day."</i> but your <code>Day</code> is already having unique values, Right? Please also mention the structure of the list you desire and what you tried to achieve that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want to for example remove <code>08:06</code> because there are two <code>11</code>s in <code>Day</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes sir. That's exactly what I mean.</span>
