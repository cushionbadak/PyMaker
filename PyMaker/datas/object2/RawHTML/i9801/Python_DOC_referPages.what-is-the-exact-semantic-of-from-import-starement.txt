<p>I've experiment with the statement,however the result did not match the official description.
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Quotation</a> is below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The from form uses a slightly more complex process:</p>
<ol>
<li>find the module specified in the from clause, loading and initializing it if necessary;</li>
<li>for each of the identifiers specified in the import clauses:
  
  <ol>
<li>check if the imported module has an attribute by that name</li>
<li>if not, attempt to import a submodule with that name and then check the imported module again for that attribute</li>
<li>if the attribute is not found, ImportError is raised.</li>
<li>otherwise, a reference to that value is stored in the local namespace, using the name in the as clause if it is present, otherwise using the attribute name</li>

<p>I created a namespace package named l007,  within which submodule named l009 was placed.I typed "from l007 import l009" in the interpreter, the execution was ok, while in which case a ImportError should have been raised.
Is my understanding wrong?</p>

<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#submodules" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a submodule is loaded using any mechanism (e.g. <code>importlib</code> APIs, the <code>import</code> or <code>import-from</code> statements, or built-in <code>__import__()</code>) a binding is placed in the parent moduleâ€™s namespace to the submodule object. For example, if package <code>spam</code> has a submodule <code>foo</code>, after importing <code>spam.foo</code>, <code>spam</code> will have an attribute <code>foo</code> which is bound to the submodule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is why the steps in your quote are in the order they are in.  Even though <code>l007</code> doesn't initially have an attribute <code>l009</code>, it will have one after the submodule import occurs.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you think an ImportError should have been raised?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">module l009 does not have a attribute named l009 corresponding with the official description.</span>
