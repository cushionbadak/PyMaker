<p>How would I generate random numbers to 2 decimal places in the range (0, 0.1]. My code so far is generating numbers with two decimal places in the range [0, 0.1]:</p>
<pre><code>radius = round(random.uniform(0, 0.1), 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps the easiest way to solve your problem is to think in terms of integers, not floating-point numbers.</p>
<p>You basically want possible random numbers like 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ..., 0.09, 0.10.</p>
<p>First you generate an integer between 1 to 10 inclusive, then you divide by 100.0 to get a floating-point number.</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>x = random.randint(1, 10)
y = x / 100.0
</code></pre>
<p>Documentation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint" rel="noreferrer"><code>random.randint(a, b)</code></a></p>

<p>Try subtract random value from max value as <code>uniform</code> includes low, but excludes high then you will get values from <code>0</code> to <code>max</code> excluding low and including high:</p>
<pre><code>radius = round(0.1-random.uniform(0, 0.1), 2)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Not sure what is wrong here. What's the error there?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AliGajani They want to exclude 0.00</span>
<span class="comment-copy">radius = round(random.uniform(0.01, 0.1), 2)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Janukasamaranyake Note that using round() creates a bias, because 0.01 is less likely to occur than 0.02</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much for the help</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Hello You are welcome! Next time there's no need to thank; simply upvote and accept the answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This still produces the same distribution, and still produces 0.00</span>
