<p>I've the following code in python: </p>
<p><code>P = [0] * (6)</code></p>
<p>What am I doing here? Am I multiplying an array and a number? What is the result?</p>
<p>I saw this topic:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/400739/what-does-asterisk-mean-in-python">What does asterisk * mean in Python?</a></p>
<p>But I guess it's not related.</p>

<p>The operators in Python are magic.  They invoke special methods depending on the class of the operand.  In this case a special method called <code>__mul__</code> is called from the <code>list</code> class, since a list object is on the left-side.</p>
<p>In the case of a list, the list is repeated by the number of times given on the right (the parentheses are meaningless in this case).  Tuple and string (<code>str</code>) objects can be multiplied in a similar way.</p>
<p>If you want to see what the special methods are, and their corresponding operators, see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/operator.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>operator</code> module documentation</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, you use the term <em>array</em>, which is understandable coming from other languages.  However <code>[0]</code> does not create an array, but a <code>list</code> object.  That might sound like semantics, but arrays do exist in python, but they have a specialised use.  There is an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">array module</a> in the standard library, and the <code>numpy</code> module also has arrays, see <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.creation.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.  For everyday use though, <code>list</code> is the norm.</p>

<p>if you run the code <code>[0] * (6)</code> you get <code>[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code>. Similarly, if you run <code>[1,2,3] * (6)</code> you get <code>[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]</code>. So the asterisk is repeating/<em>multiplying</em> the list. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're making, and concatenating, six copies of the list. I.e. <code>[0] * 6 == [0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ,0]</code></p>

<p>Snarky answer. Sorry but I cant help myself... this would have been so much less work then posting here!!!!</p>
<p>Heres a screencaputre of me finding the answer by typing 15 characters. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Will be the same as <code>p = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code>, please be aware when doing <code>p = [[]] * 6</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Obviously there are some programmers who fell into an empty cauldron when they were young.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">... and concatenating them.</span>
