<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Maybe it's not clear enough, let me explain :
I want to write into a csv file, i'm using a list with 3 strings in it for example and i want to give every elements of the list to <code>writer.writerow()</code>
as <code>write.writerow(['test', 'test1', 'test2'])</code>.</p>
<p>I cannot give directly the list otherwise it will print " ['test1', 'test2', 'test3'] "  in only one cell of the csv file.</p>
<p>I was thinking about a for loop maybe, but i'm not a beast with python so any help would be appreciated. </p>
<p>Couldn't find any help on the internet.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I guess this will help you.</p>
<pre><code>import re

test = "['test1', 'test2', 'test3']"
match = re.compile(r"'\w+'")
my_list = [t.strip("'") for t in match.findall(test)]
for line in my_list:
    writer.writerow(line)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From the CSV docs, it looks like anything passed to .writerow() that isn't a string (eg., your list) is stringified.</p>
<p>Try this?</p>
<pre><code>mylist = ['test', 'test1', 'test2']
for line in mylist:
    writer.writerow(line)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not 100% sure, but maybe what you're after is <code>writer.writerow(*your_list)</code>, where <code>*</code> unpacks the list?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">it says Python versions &lt; 3.5 do not support <code>*</code> in tuples, lists and sets :/</span>

<span class="comment-copy">If you are using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/csv.html#csv.writer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv.writer</a>, it looks like you are doing it right. It should print the strings in separate columns.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't help because it prints every word on a new line, thanks anyway</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, I thought that's what you wanted to do. Can you give an example, using the <code>['test', 'test1', 'test2']</code> list, of what you'd like the output to be? Do you want <code>test, test1, test2</code> in one line?</span>
