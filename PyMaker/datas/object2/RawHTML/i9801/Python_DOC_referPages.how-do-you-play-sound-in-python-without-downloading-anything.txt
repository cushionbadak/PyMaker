<p>I have been looking for ages on ways to find out how to make idle python play sound such as wav.</p>
<p>The solutions I have found are used by programs such as pygame. I can't download pygame or any other program.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>To play a sound without downloading anything, you use the code:</p>
<pre><code>import winsound

winsound.PlaySound('FILENAMEHERE.wav', winsound.SND_FILENAME)
</code></pre>
<p>keep everything the same apart from FILENAMEHERE</p>

<p>Why are you unable to download anything? <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/playsound/1.2.1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/playsound/1.2.1</a> - link for playsound module it is very easy to download. You can download it using pip by navigating with cmd to your python folder (usualy C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32) and writing: python -m pip install playsound (if you are using python 3). I think that is the easiest and the fastest way for you to play sound if you have any other questions about this let me know. </p>
<p>p.s
