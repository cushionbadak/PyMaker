<p>While reading through the Python 3 Lexical analysis, I became slightly confused by the last section on operators[1] and delimiters. The <code>@</code> character is listed as both an operator and a delimiter, and <code>@=</code> is also listed as an augmented assignment operator. Following the form of other augmented assignment operators, I would expect this to mean that the <code>@</code> character can be used like so:</p>
<pre><code>x = x @ y
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>x @= y
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried using it in this way with integers and strings without any success. I am familiar with using <code>@</code> for decorators, but fail to see how an augmented assignment operator is compatible with decorators.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of <code>@</code> and <code>@=</code> when used as an operator and/or delimiter in Python 3?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The @ (at) operator is intended to be used for matrix multiplication. No builtin Python types implement this operator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you have to use numpy or other math libraries to make <code>x = x @ y</code> work. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">as an operator it's a matrix multiply. <code>a = np.arange(4).reshape(2, 2); b = np.arange(4).reshape(2, 2); print(a @ b)</code> shows <code>array([[ 2,  3], [ 6, 11]])</code>. I've only seen it work with numpy arrays though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Elliot you do appear to be correct, but I'd love to know if this works outside of numpy. Using your example, I tried <code>a @= b</code> and received the following error:  <code>TypeError: In-place matrix multiplication is not (yet) supported. Use 'a = a @ b' instead of 'a @= b'.</code></span>
