<p>I know Jython converts Python code into Java byte code, but are there any syntax changes between the two? and as a side question is Jython 3.x usable yet or is it still being ported?</p>

<p>Jython is an <a href="http://www.jython.org/jythonbook/en/1.0/LangSyntax.html#the-difference-between-jython-and-python" rel="noreferrer">implementation</a> of the Python language.  It is not a different language at all.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.jython.org/" rel="noreferrer">Jython website</a>, the latest stable version is currently 2.5.3b1, and the latest development version is 2.7a2.  As far as I know, no one is currently working on an 3.x-compatible version of Jython.</p>

<h3>Jython</h3>
<ol>
<li>100% Java</li>
<li>Any JVM (currently 1.1+)</li>
<li>Compiles to .class</li>
<li>Extend with Java</li>
<li>Truly multi-threaded</li>
<li>Java garbage collection</li>

<p>There are 3 major implementations available for Python language. Jython is a java implementation, Cython is C implementation and IronPython is c# implementation. As far as Python language syntax is concerned, it remains consistent in all implementations. Regarding the last part of your question, I dont think Jython version 3.x is released or in use yet, probably you meant python 3.x - if so, yes it is.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">A quick search on Google can give you the answer to this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Syntax changes? Not any intentional ones. Jython has recently released the alpha version of 2.7. It's likely it will be a while before a 3.x version will be released.</span>
