<p>I'm developing an application with Tkinter that uses a database of <code>png</code> image files for icons. In order to use said images in the application, I open them using PIL's <code>Image.open</code>, run it through the <code>ImageTk.PhotoImage</code> function, then pass it to the widget constructor.</p>
<p>The problem is, I'm trying to port my entire project over to Python 3.x, and because of PIL's lack of support for Python 3, I have no idea how to load the icons into the application.</p>
<p>If anyone knew of a solution that would allow me to use the icons without having to convert all of them to <code>.gif</code> bitmaps, I would be very grateful!</p>

<p>PNG files, even with transparency, are correctly displayed in tkinter and ttk in python 3.4.1 on Linux, even though only GIF and PPM/PGM support is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html" rel="noreferrer">documented</a>.</p>

<p>Above PNG image contains transparency.</p>
<pre class="lang-python prettyprint-override"><code>from tkinter import *          

root = Tk()                    

photo = PhotoImage(file="example.png")
photo_label = Label(image=photo)
photo_label.grid()             
photo_label.image = photo      

text = Label(text="Text") # included to show background color
text.grid()    

root.mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>Above code renders the image correctly with transparency as seen below:</p>
