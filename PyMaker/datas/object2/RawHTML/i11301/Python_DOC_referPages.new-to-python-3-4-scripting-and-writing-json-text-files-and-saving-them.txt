<p>I'm currently trying to write a script in Python that can manipulate JSON ".txt" files within a folder and saving it as a new JSON ".txt" file within the same folder.  I already know how to manipulate the file, but I'd need to manually type in the actual path.  Is there a way to just type in the folder name and the name of the text file to just manipulate that instead of typing the full path? </p>
<p>Because right now, I'm having it to do</p>
<pre><code>    import json
    simple_path = input('Please input the path directory: ")
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'c:\user\path1\path2\simple.txt'
    with open (simple_path,'r+') as f:
        simple_data = json.load(f)
        somefunction()
        f.seek(0)
        out_file = open('c://user//path1//path2//simple_edit.txt','w')
        json.dump(simple_data, out_file)
</code></pre>
<p>each time I want to manipulate a specific JSON text files, I'd have to change the whole path, and I'd have to edit "out_file" manually every single time, so I can I make it more flexible?</p>
<p>since I'll be placing the script into a main folder with all the sub-folders and JSON Files.  It'd be easier for me to manipulate the sub-folder JSON text files without having to put the full path.</p>

<p>Yes you can easily do that with the os module</p>
<pre><code>import os

folder = input('please enter the folder:')

file = input('enter the filename:')

print('C'+os.path.join(os.sep, folder, file))
</code></pre>
<p><code>os.path.join</code> constructs the path to the file by joining the strings you supplied to it and adding the correct file separator (<code>/</code> in *nix systems and <code>\</code> on windows)</p>
<p>while <code>os.sep</code> returns a string of the root directory which will be <code>/</code> in *nix systems and <code>\</code> in windows</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For the input, relative paths may be sufficient. For the output, just generate the filename from the input filename by adding '_edit' using <code>os.path.splitext()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import json
import os

def edit_json(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r+') as f:
        simple_data = json.load(f)
        somefunction()
        f.seek(0)
        base, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
        out_file = open(base + '_edit' + ext, 'w')
        json.dump(simple_data, out_file)

simple_path = input('Please input the path directory: ")
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'path2\simple.txt'

edit_json(simple_path)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You have to pass <code>simple data as an argument: </code>somefunction(simple_data)` and <code>def somefunction(data): ...</code></span>
