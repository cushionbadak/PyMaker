<p>I want to implement a class in Python where modifying a subset of its attributes leads to a specific class method being called. I see that Python offers many ways to achieve something what I want but I'm not sure which is the most Pythonic and minimalistic way to achieve this.</p>
<p>For instance, let's say we have class <code>Foo</code> with attributes <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>, and we're interested in intercepting modifications to attributes <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. Whenever someone calls <code>foo.x = ...</code> or <code>foo.y = ...</code>, I want method <code>foo.bar</code> to be called. Also, I don't really care if I have to use a wrapper for each attribute, provided that this wrapper would have to be written only once, e.g. somehow intercept calls to virtually non-existent methods <code>foo.set_x(...)</code> and <code>foo.set_y(...)</code> to <code>def foo.set_member(self, member, value): ...</code>.</p>

<p>This is actually pretty easy with the new classes in Python, built on top of the <code>object</code> class :</p>
<pre><code>class Foo ( object ) :

    def __setattr__ ( self, name, value ) :
        self.bar( name, value )
        object.__setattr__( self, name, value )

    def bar ( self, name, value ) :
        print( 'Setting {} to {}.'.format( name, value ) )
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">So you want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setattr__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__setattr__</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe that's exactly what I need, I missed the part that explains how to actually access the member once inside the <code>__setattr__</code> function. However, it turns out that having a <code>set_XXX</code> method (were the <code>XXX</code> part of the method name is resolved dynamically) would suit my needs better. Unfortunately, it looks like that Python doesn't give me a chance via some mechanism to intercept a method call, it immediatelly fails with <code>AttributeError</code>.</span>
