<p>I am trying to use <code>os.path.basename(path)</code> on a string. I thought that was how it was used. In the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html" rel="nofollow">doc for version 3</a> it clearly says that is the case but I am using 2.7. How do I use the method if all I have is a string (which clearly don't have a path attribute?)</p>

<p>You probably have overridden <code>os</code> with your own variable.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import os
# ...
os = "abc"
# ...
os.path # &lt;-- error
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure you don't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing" rel="nofollow">shadow</a> imported libraries.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Quick overshadowing check: what does <code>print(type(os))</code> output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh... gah scary! :)</span>
