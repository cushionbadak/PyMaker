<p>I am implementing a class in which I want an attribute to never be deleted i.e. <code>del myClass.immortal_attr</code>. What Exception is acceptable to raise for when the user attempts to do this?</p>
<p>None of the builtin exceptions seemed obvious to me, it doesn't feel like I should need to implement a custom Exception class. Something like <code>DeleteError</code> seems like a fairly universal need.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Raise an <code>AttributeError</code>, just like the types that come with Python do:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; del (1).bit_length
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'int' object attribute 'bit_length' is read-only
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(object):
...     @property
...     def x(self):
...         return 3
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; del Foo().x
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: can't delete attribute

<p>Incidentally, implementing your attribute with a <code>property</code> might be a good way to achieve what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>I believe <code>AttributeError</code> might work for what you are trying to do, but you could also create your own custom exception if that doesn't quite suit what you want to do.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why not an <code>AttributeError</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or simply <code>RuntimeError</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>RuntimeError</code> would be my choice if nothing else is appropriate, which is what I wasn't sure of.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I thought this might have been the way but my test case had a bug...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is deletion with <code>del</code> an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AttributeError" rel="nofollow noreferrer">attribute reference</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm. I'm honestly not positive. Are you using <code>(object).__del__(self)</code>? Looking at the documentation for that, it looks like exceptions for this are totally ignored. <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Documentation</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Colby: <code>del</code> and <code>__del__</code> are unrelated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112: Not always true. <code>__del__</code> (<code>del var</code>) and <code>__delattr__</code>/<code>__delete__</code> (<code>del var.attr</code>) are different things though</span>
