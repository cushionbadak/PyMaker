<p>is there a way of passing a field of an array of collections into a function so that it can still be used to access a element in the collection in python?. i am attempting to search through an array of collections to locate a particular item by comparing it with an identifier. this identifier and field being compared will change as the function is called in different stages of the program. is there a way of passing up the field to the function, to access the required element for comparison? 
this is the code that i have tried thus far:

<p>In your code, <code>M_work</code> is a list. Lists are accessed using an index and this syntax: <code>myList[index]</code>. So that would translate to <code>M_work[place]</code> in your case. Then you say that <code>M_work</code> stores objects which have fields, and you want to access one of these fields by name. To do that, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow">getattr</a> like this: <code>getattr(M_work[place], field)</code>. You can compare the return value to <code>identifier</code>.</p>
<p>Other mistakes in the code you show:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>place</code> is misspelled <code>pace</code> at one point.</li>
<li><code>True</code> is misspelled <code>true</code> at one point.</li>
<li>The body of your loop always returns at the first iteration: there is a <code>return</code> in both the <code>if found == True</code> and <code>else</code> branches. I don't think this is what you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>You could improve your code by:</p>
<ul>
<li>noticing that <code>if found == True</code> is equivalent to <code>if found</code>.</li>
<li>finding how you don't actually need the <code>found</code> variable.</li>
<li>looking at <a href="http://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops" rel="nofollow">Python's <code>for...in</code> loop</a>.</li>

<span class="comment-copy">"a field of an array of collections" Phew, could you please <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/37546864/edit">edit</a> your question and include an example for what you try to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hint: Since you put code into graphic files, maybe this will help: <a href="https://xkcd.com/1685/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">xkcd.com/1685</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Although I dont entirely understand what you want, you are probably looking for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow noreferrer">getattr</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you so much!!!, that work so well and your suggestions allowed me to simplify my code so much, your amassing!  thank you.</span>
