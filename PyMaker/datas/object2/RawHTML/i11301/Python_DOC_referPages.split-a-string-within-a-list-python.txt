<p>I have a list in python, which is from a text document that I split at new line characters. The end of data is indicated with <code>#</code> in the text document. I need to count each of element of the list and then split the strings in the list at tab characters, creating a two dimensional list.</p>
<p>I thought this was fairly simple, however, I'm not getting a result from my code. The strings in the list are not splitting at all, nevermind at <code>\t</code>.</p>
<pre><code>with open('names.txt') as names:
    records = names.read().split('\n')
recordcount = 0
for item in records:
    if item != '#':
        recordcount += 1
        item = item.split('\t')
print (records)
print (recordcount)
</code></pre>
<p>Has this got something to do with tab characters being troublesome? Or can I not replace elements of a list in-place? Should I be creating a new list with my split records?</p>

<p>You're just reassigning a local variable. This doesn't affect the contents of the list. Try this:</p>
<pre><code>for i, item in enumerate(records):
    if item != '#':
        recordcount += 1
        records[i] = item.split('\t')
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You can replace list items in-place, but <code>item = item.split('\t')</code> just re-assigns the local variable <code>item</code>.  You can easily replace the list item by e.g. <code>records[index] = item</code>.  You can get the right <code>index</code> by using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow"><code>enumerate</code></a> function.</p>
<p>Your code changed to do what you want:</p>
<pre><code>with open('names.txt') as names:                                            
    records = names.read().split('\n')                                      
recordcount = 0                                                             
for index, item in enumerate(records):                                      
    if item != '#':                                                         
        recordcount += 1                                                    
        item = item.split('\t')                                             
        records[index] = item                                               
print (records)                                                             
print (recordcount)

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, thank you. I should have looked more closely at my work, such an obvious error. Thanks.</span>
