<p>I am trying to get more information out of an exception object, <code>err</code>, beyond its error message. In my code I sometimes capture exceptions deep in some subfunction. Back at the top level I want to print info about where the exception occurred etc.</p>
<p>I have seen similar questions where the answers involve using <code>sys.exc_info</code>, but according to the docs, this is too limited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return information about the most recent exception caught by an except
  clause in the current stack frame or in an older stack frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>whereas I want to get this information from an arbitrary exception object captured and stored at some unknowable point in the program execution, with possibly multiple exceptions being raised at later points.</p>
<p>The information seems to be in there; if I issue <code>raise err</code> it all comes out. But I cannot figure out how to pry it out of the exception object without <code>rais</code>ing it. Can I somehow capture the output from <code>raise</code> in a string and print that?</p>

<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html" rel="nofollow"><code>traceback</code></a> module:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import traceback
&gt;&gt;&gt; try:
...  raise Exception()
... except Exception as e:
...  print(traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__))
... 
[('&lt;stdin&gt;', 2, '&lt;module&gt;', None)]
</code></pre>
<p>(2 is the line number)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Until it is raised, an exception is just a regular object.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that's why I am asking. How can I inspect this object to find line numbers etc?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Line number of what? It can't be the line the exception was raised</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And why is that? If I raise the exception manually it tells me where it was first raised, which is what I am looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because you're asking about exceptions that were not raised.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Exactly what I was looking for!</span>
