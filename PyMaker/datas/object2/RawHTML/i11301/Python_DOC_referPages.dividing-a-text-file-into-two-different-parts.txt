<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have written a simple script to collect a list of titles from the JSON file and generated a text file containing the list.</p>
<p>The result is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Animal geography
Autobiogeography
Chorography
Economic geography
Footloose industry
Geomorphometry
Health geography
Human geography
Military geography
Philosophy of geography
Physical geography
Political geography
Regional geography
Satirical cartography
Settlement geography
Transport geography
Vernacular geography
Visual geography

Category:Economic geography
Category:Geodemography

Category:Military geography
Category:Physical geography
Category:Political geography
Category:Regional geography
Category:Settlement geography
Category:Topography
Category:Toponymy
Category:Transportation geography
Category:Vernacular geography
Category:Geography by place  
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>The problem that I am facing right now is how to split the text file into two parts:</p>
<p>The first part is text file containing :</p>
<pre><code>Animal geography
Autobiogeography
Chorography
Economic geography
Footloose industry
Geomorphometry
Health geography
Human geography
Military geography
Philosophy of geography
Physical geography
Political geography
Regional geography
Satirical cartography
Settlement geography
Transport geography
Vernacular geography
Visual geography
</code></pre>
<p>And a second text file containing those which begins with the word Category:</p>
<pre><code>Category:Cartography
Category:Economic geography
Category:Geodemography
Category:Human geography
Category:Military geography
Category:Physical geography
Category:Political geography
Category:Regional geography
Category:Settlement geography
Category:Topography
Category:Toponymy
Category:Transportation geography
Category:Vernacular geography
Category:Geography by place  
</code></pre>
<p>I am totally at a lost on how to do it. Please advice.</p>
<p>Sorry for the confusing title. I have no idea how to explain my problem. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
<p>For example I have extracted all the titles from this API (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;format=json&amp;list=categorymembers&amp;cmtitle=Category%3ABranches%20of%20geography&amp;cmlimit=100" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&amp;format=json&amp;list=categorymembers&amp;cmtitle=Category%3ABranches%20of%20geography&amp;cmlimit=100</a>) :</p>

<p>I really appreciate if you can point me to the right direction on how to solve this problem. </p>
<p><strong>Thank you all for your assistance and guidance.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try this :</p>
<pre><code>with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:

    data = []
    category = []

    lines = f.readlines()

    for line in lines:
        if line.startswith('Category'):
            category.append(line)
        else:
            data.append(line)

    cat_file = open('category.txt', 'w')
    data_file = open('data.txt', 'w')

    cat_file.write(''.join(category))
    data_file.write(''.join(data))

    cat_file.close()
    data_file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>This reads the file <code>file.txt</code> line by line, and test if it begins with "Category". If it's the case, it adds the line to the <code>category</code> array, and if not, to the <code>data</code> array.</p>
<p>After processing the file, the program merges all the lines and write them to category.txt and data.txt.</p>
<p>Hope it'll be helpful.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To test if a line in a file begins with  "Category:", you can simply do this:</p>
<pre><code>with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f.read().splitlines():
        if line[0:8] == "Category":
            &lt;here your code that writes "Category:" lines in a new file&gt;
        else:
            &lt;here your code that writes all other lines in a new file&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Thanks  leekaiinthesky for telling me to use 'in'</p>
<pre><code>f1 = open('List.text', 'r')
f2 = open('WordWithCat.text', 'w')
f3 = open('WordwithoutCat.text', 'w')
query = 'Category:'
lines = f1.read().splitlines()

for  line in lines:

    if query in line:
        f2.write(line+'\n')

    else:

        f3.write(line+'\n')

<p>It turn out to be not as complicated as I thought it would be. Thank you all for your help and guidance.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried so far? Why not just generate two files when you're parsing the JSON?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might find the <code>in</code> operator useful: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#membership-test-details" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The reason is these are all the title founds based on the json . When I extract I have extracted all the titles out but I do not know how to separate them .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@windboy no problem, you can accept the answer if it solves your issue.</span>
