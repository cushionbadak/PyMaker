<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried? What format file do you want to save to? And what exactly do you want to write to another file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can just print a string to file using <code>f.open(file_to_write_to, 'w')</code> and <code>f.write(string_to_print)</code>. See the documentation for more info: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a> If you need more specific help, you should ask a more specifc question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@shaheen: evryone loves to help, when you show us the code just remember to indent by 4 spaces in the textarea, so it is readable for the world willing to help. And the above two comments are IMO full of good hints already</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your replies. i want to store above printed result into text file..f.write(string_to_print) will save whatever string we give to the file, but my requirement is i want to store output of a curl command which i have stored in variable "result" to a file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">date = datetime.datetime.strptime(match.group(), '%Y.%m.%d').date()  i have used this in my python code, looks like this doesnt work with python 2.4.3 version. can you please suggest me, what can i use instead of this in  2.4.3</span>
