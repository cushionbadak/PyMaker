<p>The instructions that I've been given tells me create 2 functions: first one (helloWorld) just has to print a basic string but the second one (helloWorldNTimes) has to call the first one 'n' amount of times. This is what I have so far - I either don't understand the question completely or misinterpreting it.</p>
<pre><code>def helloWorld():
    print('Hello World')

def helloWorldNTimes(n):

def main():
    helloWorldNTimes(7)

main()
</code></pre>

<p>You have to study loops in programming language. Especially for loop. </p>
<p>You have to call function inside a loop. It can be either while or for loop. Then only it can be called n number of times.</p>
<p>Example :</p>
<pre><code>def helloWorld():
    print ("Hello, World!")

for x in range(7):
    helloWorld()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>your 2nd function doesn't do anything... you have to call a loop "n" times to have it done:</p>
<pre><code>def helloWorld():
    print('Hello World')

def helloWorldNTimes(n):
    for x in range(7):
        helloWorld()

def main():
    helloWorldNTimes(7)

main()

<span class="comment-copy">looks like you need to learn what loops are, specifically something called a <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_for_loop.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">for loop</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So far so good! Now you just need to think of a looping structure to use in the <code>helloWorldNTimes</code> function..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I warmly suggest you to start with a good tutorial on the Python basics, e.g. the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">one</a> available on the Python official site.</span>
