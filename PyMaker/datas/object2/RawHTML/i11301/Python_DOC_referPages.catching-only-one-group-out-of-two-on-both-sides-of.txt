<p>I need to catch something inside double or single quotes, logically, I do this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; re.match( '"(\d+)"|\'(\d+)\'', "'123'" ).groups()
(None, '123')
</code></pre>
<p>But for some reason two groups are returned, why?..</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because your regex contains two groups and <code>groups()</code> returns "<em>a tuple containing all the subgroups of the match, from 1 up to however many groups are in the pattern</em>" (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match.groups" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match.groups</a>).</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>s1 = '..."123"...'
s2 = "...'123'..."
s3 = """...'123"..."""

&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall(r'(\'\d+\'|"\d+")', s1)
['"123"']

&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall(r'(\'\d+\'|"\d+")', s2)
["'123'"]

&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall(r'(\'\d+\'|"\d+")', s3)
[]

<span class="comment-copy">I thought only matched groups are returned, first one didn't. How can I achieve my goal then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@VasylDemianov <code>re.match( '(["\'])(\d+)\\1', "'123'" ).group(2)</code> might work. Disclaimer: I don't know Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you are right, it will in this very case, but it will not if the string I am trying to match is <code>'"123"'</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@VasylDemianov I tried it in <a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">repl.it/languages/python3</a> and it worked fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, wait, I didn't read your regex properly. Sorry.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That also matches <code>"123'</code>, unlike OP's code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, this will work and I can remove quotes afterwards, but I am sure there must be a way to achieve this using regex.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, not a regex, use comprehension. If you use PyPi regex module you can use a branch reset though.</span>
