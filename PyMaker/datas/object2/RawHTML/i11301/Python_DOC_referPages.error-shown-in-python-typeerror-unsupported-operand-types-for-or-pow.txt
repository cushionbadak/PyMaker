<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I just started python today..  Spent hours on codeacademy and learnt quite a bit so I thought I'd make my own program to square the ages of a person and their sibling. Very basic just a starter. Pretty useless actually just wanted to see what I can do.  I keep getting this TypeError mentioned in the title. Here's my code :</p>
<pre><code>a=raw_input(''enter age'') 
b=raw_input(''sibling's age'') 
Square=a**2 + b**2 + 2ab
If square &lt;160:
    Print 'really young people' 
Else:
    Print 'square of sum &gt;160'
</code></pre>
<p>Please help
Thanks!! </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First and foremost, if you're just starting, you <strong><em>really</em></strong> should be learning Python 3, not 2. </p>
<p>The code you posted has many issues. Here's a line-by-line breakdown, with corrections in Python 3:</p>
<pre><code>a=raw_input(''enter age'') 
b=raw_input(''sibling's age'')
</code></pre>
<p>You need to use either single quotes <code>'</code> or double quotes <code>"</code>, but not two single quotes to define strings. Try:</p>
<pre><code>a = int(input("Enter age"))
b = int(input("Sibling's age"))
</code></pre>
<p>There is no <code>raw_input()</code> in Python 3, it's just <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input()</code></a>. This function also returns a string, so if you want to do math on it you need to call <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow"><code>int()</code></a> to turn the result into an integer.</p>
<pre><code>Square=a**2 + b**2 + 2ab
</code></pre>
<p>As long as <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are ints, the first two parts of the expression are fine, but you need to remember that all operations in Python are explicit, so you'll need to fix the last part like so:</p>
<pre><code>Square = a**2 + b**2 + 2*a*b
</code></pre>
<p>Now for the last part:</p>
<pre><code>If square &lt;160:
    Print 'really young people' 
Else:
    Print 'square of sum &gt;160'
</code></pre>
<p>Python is case-sensitive. Since you used <code>Square</code> above, you'll need to use the same capitalization down here. Likewise, builtin keywords and functions are all in lowercase (<code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>print()</code>, etc.). Finally, in Python 3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print</code></a> is a function, not a statement, so you'll need parentheses <code>( )</code> around your arguments:</p>
<pre><code>if Square &lt; 160:
    print("Really young people")
else:
    print("square of sum &gt; 160")
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>So, here's your complete Python 3 code:</p>
<pre><code>a = int(input("Enter age"))
b = int(input("Sibling's age"))
Square = a**2 + b**2 + 2*a*b
if Square &lt; 160:
    print("Really young people")
else:
    print("square of sum &gt; 160")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Start by learning Python 3, not 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Even before the type problems, this code is full of syntax errors. You need to post code you actually ran.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright but will this work in python 3?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112 this is the code I ran... It works just fine till the mathematical part</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KarlStark: No it's not. If you tried to run this code, you would get a SyntaxError instead of a TypeError. This code is different from the code you actually ran on every single line, as every single line has a syntax problem that would have aborted compilation with a SyntaxError before the TypeError could occur.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While learning Python 3 would be a good move, I think mixing syntax corrections and Python 2-&gt;3 conversions confuses the issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112 perhaps, but since it's the OP's first day learning Python, I want to get them on the right track as quickly as possible.</span>
