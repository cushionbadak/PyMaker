<p>I'm trying to change the output of Boolean values.</p>
<p>For example if I've got something like:</p>
<pre><code>3 == 3
</code></pre>
<p>I don't want it to return <code>True</code>, but to return something that I specify like <code>Correct</code></p>
<p>How can I do this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def equivalence(a,b):

    if(a==b):
       print("Correct")
    else:
       print("Incorrect")
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can call this function.</p>
<pre><code>equivalence(5,5) #This will print "Correct"
equivalence(5,6) #This will print "Incorrect"
</code></pre>
<p>If you actually want to change what <code>==</code> actually <em>does</em>, you would have to override the operator class <code>__eq__</code>. But this can quickly become out-of-hand if you are just starting out with programming.</p>
<p><strong>Edit to address OP's comment:</strong></p>
<p>What I wrote can be replaced to anything. You can do something as simple as:</p>
<pre><code>if(2+3&lt;5-7):
   print("Correct")
else:
   print("Incorrect")
</code></pre>
<p>The general format is:</p>
<pre><code>if(condition):
   #What to do if condition is true.
else:
   #What to do if condition is false.
</code></pre>
<p>You don't even need a function to do this. You can use if-statements on their own like what I did above.</p>
<p><strong>Second edit:</strong></p>
<p>Okay now I see what you want. Here's what you can do. It might be a little complex but bear with me.</p>
<p>Create a function such as this. You can name it whatever you want as long as you're consistent: </p>
<pre><code>def booleanizer(condition):
   if(condition):
      print("Correct")
      return True
   else:
      print("Incorrect")
      return False
</code></pre>
<p>Now, wherever you have a conditional statement where you are trying to print "correct" or "incorrect", just wrap the conditional statement in <code>booleanizer</code> as follows:</p>
<p>Say you have <code>2+3&lt;5-7</code> and you want to "booleanize" it.</p>
<pre><code>booleanizer(2+3&lt;5-7) #this prints "Incorrect"
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could apply this to any conditional</p>
<pre><code>booleanizer("This"=="This") #Prints "Correct"
booleanizer(7&lt;5) #Prints "Incorrect"
</code></pre>
<p>etc...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="nofollow">shorties way</a> to do it is:</p>
<pre><code>"Correct" if 3 == 3 else "Incorrect"
</code></pre>
<p>There is no good way to change behaivour of <code>print(True)</code> output.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>x = float(input("enter a Number between 1 - 5: "))

Correct = False

while (not Correct):

    if x == 3:
        Correct = True
        print("Correct")

    else:
        print("sorry guess again!")
        x = float(input("enter a Number between 1 - 5: "))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi rb612. Thanks for your answer. I am definitely a beginner with programming. I understand parts of the code you mentioned. such as def and equivalence, it's more about calling functions which confuses me. I not sure if it will still help as I think I might've worded my question wrong. Basically there is a line of code that says: 'print 3 + 2 &lt; 5 - 7' and this returns False, I want it to say Incorrect. In other words the 3 == 3 example, probably wasn't relevant to the question as there is no == in the code. Oops :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem! We're here to help. Please see my edit which should address your exact question. If you are satisfied with my answer, please click the checkmark to mark as answered. To answer your question regarding calling functions, you can post a new question and link to it here, and I could answer it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can also use <code>print "Correct" if 2+3 &lt; 5-7 else "Incorrect"</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KerryM-R yep, and that's what's great about Python as a dynamic language. But for a beginning programmer, I think it's best to teach the standard if/else statements.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, so I believe that the question is almost solved. However, the suggestions seem to mostly apply to one condition. Since I multiple conditions throughout the code, I need a way of applying the method across all the conditions that are in the script. So, instead of getting a boolean response of "True", I want it to say "Correct". Thanks again everyone for all your comments so far. I guess the main thing that I'm trying to achieve is replace boolean values 'True' and 'False' with custom values, like 'Correct' and 'Incorrect'.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is not what OP was asking. OP is talking about a generalized example of equating two values and instead of just saying "true" or "false" will print a custom string.</span>
