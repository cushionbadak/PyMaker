<p>I have been attempting to upgrade <code>argparse</code> on Ubuntu 16.04 to the latest version, but <code>pip</code> keeps saying that it is part of the standard library.</p>
<p>How can this package be upgraded?</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo pip install argparse --upgrade
Collecting argparse
  Using cached argparse-1.4.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Installing collected packages: argparse
  Found existing installation: argparse 1.2.1
    Not uninstalling argparse at /usr/lib/python2.7, as it is in the standard library.
Successfully installed argparse-1.2.1

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Argparse is maintained as a separate package here: <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse" rel="nofollow">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse</a>
Which is where pip is going to collect it.</p>
<p>But</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of Python &gt;= 2.7 and &gt;= 3.2, the argparse module is maintained
  within the Python standard library. For users who still need to
  support Python &lt; 2.7 or &lt; 3.2, it is also provided as a separate
  package....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, you are getting the error because it <em>is</em> part of the standard library, but also available to install via pip if you are using a version of Python for which it <em>isn't</em>.</p>
<p>If you really need to install 1.4.0 try this: (worked for me on my Windows 2.7.11 install)</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the gzip file, not the wheel, from the pypi <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse#downloads" rel="nofollow">downloads</a> page</li>
<li>Uncompress the archive and open a terminal in the <code>argparse-1.4.01</code> folder</li>
<li>Run <code>python setup.py install</code> (See the 'Install' section of first link)</li>
</ul>
<p>And check you now have the correct version (hopefully):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import argparse
&gt;&gt;&gt; argparse.__version__
'1.4.0' 
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br/>
This still leaves the original <code>argparse.py</code> (in <code>...Python27\Lib</code> for me) intact, and places the 1.4.0 egg in <code>site-packages</code>, with an <code>easy-install.pth</code> file which I presume ensures that this version gets used in preference to the standard library one.  </p>
