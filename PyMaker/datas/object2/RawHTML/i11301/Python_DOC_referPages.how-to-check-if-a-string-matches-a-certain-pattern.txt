<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a string which is basically a file path of an .mp4 file. </p>
<p>I want to test if the file path is matching one of the following patterns:</p>
<pre><code>/*.mp4   (nothing before the slash, anything after)
*/*.mp4  (anything before and after the slash)
[!A]*.mp4  (anything before the extension, **except** for the character 'A')
</code></pre>
<p>What would be the best way to achieve this?
Thanks!</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I'm not looking to test if the file ends with .mp4, i'm looking to test if it ends with it <strong>and</strong> matches each of those 3 scenarios separately.</p>
<p>I tried using the 'endswith' but it's too general and can't "get specific" like what i'm looking for in my examples. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here they are:</p>
<pre><code>string.endswith('.mp4') and string.startswith('/')

string.endswith('.mp4') and "/" in string

string.endswith('.mp4') and "A" not in string
</code></pre>
<p>Or, look at using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>fnmatch</code></a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@Gambit2007 The question does not show any research effort. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">alright, it really was my bad. yet people still marked this question as a duplicate when it wasn't.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just one correction - in order to find a forwardslash you need to escape it so it would actually be '//'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Gambit2007 no, you wouldn't need to escape it. On most systems, only backslashes must be escaped.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, i'm using OS X El Capitan and i had to escape it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wim why did you change 'A' not in string to not string.startswith('a') .  Seems different to third criteria.  Also, why fnmatch instead of find</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My mistake. Changed it back. <code>fnmatch</code> is the usual approach to this kind of globbing, it might help other readers to have it mentioned.  find is no good here because that doesn't support wildcarding in any way.</span>
