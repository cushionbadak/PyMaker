<p>I am trying to get the tweets of a list of users into an object in Python using Tweepy, with the intention of iterating through every tweet and passing it into a text classification algorithm.</p>
<p>The array where the tweets are saved in, is of the form:</p>
<pre><code>tweets = [[tweet.id_str+screen_name, 0, tweet.text.encode("utf-8")] for tweet in alltweets]
</code></pre>
<p>So what I need is to iterate through every row of the array and get the string (the tweet text) of the third column.</p>
<p><strong>What is the proper syntax for doing it?</strong> </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Based on what you provided:</p>
<pre><code>tweet_texts = [tweet[2].decode("utf-8") for tweet in tweets]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">This is an array of arrays, not of tuples. It doesn't matter for @BardiHarborow's answer, but perhaps worth pointing out.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In fact it's a list of lists. An <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>array</code></a> is something different in Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why this does not work?      csvtweets = [[tweet.id_str+screen_name, 0, tweet.text.encode("utf-8")] for tweet in alltweets] 	 	tweet_texts = [csvtweets[3] for row in csvtweets] 	print tweet_texts  Instead, the output is all the 3 objects that every row/array (as @unwind said) has. Shouldn't the 3 in the brackets identify the column i want to get from every row?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@YanisKartalis, Python uses <a href="http://python-history.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/why-python-uses-0-based-indexing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">0-based indexing</a>, i.e. the first element is actually referred to as the 0th element.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you @Bardi Harborow ! this solved my issue :)</span>
