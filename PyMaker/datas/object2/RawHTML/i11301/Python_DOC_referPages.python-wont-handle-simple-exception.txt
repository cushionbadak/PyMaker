<p>It just wont go into the except block, instead it states there is not such file or directory.. shouldn't it enter in the except block if I get an IOError? what am I missing?</p>
<pre><code>try:
    file_users = open ('datos/usuarios.json','r')
    dic = json.load(file_users)
    file_users.close()
except EOFError, IOError:
    print("File does not exist")
</code></pre>

<p>You are missing brackets around your errors, they need to be passed as a tuple:</p>
<pre><code>except (EOFError, IOError):
</code></pre>
<p>Compare the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow">relevant section of the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Your whole block becomes:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    archivo_usuarios = open ('datos/usuarios.json','r')
    dic = json.load(archivo_usuarios)
    archivo_usuarios.close()
except (EOFError, IOError):
    print("File does not exist")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Add parenthesis around them: <code>except (EOFError, IOError)</code>. <code>except EOFError, IOError</code> is equivalent to <code>except EOFError as IOError</code> in Python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm, I get the same when parenthesis are around them, it still won't enter the except block. This is how I have them now: except (EOFError, IOError): Also, I wasn't able to find the duplicate of this thread!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perhaps you're still running the old code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As I said above, it still wont enter the except block regardless if I wrap the  exceptions in parenthesis. Weird.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have added the whole block with the change in the answer above, when I run this on my machine (where the file doesn't exist, hence a <code>IOError</code> is raised), it prints <code>File does not exist</code> as expected.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ye it works if I do a separate .py file and run it from scratch, but somehow with my entire code it seems not to work. I'll try and see whats up, thanks !</span>
