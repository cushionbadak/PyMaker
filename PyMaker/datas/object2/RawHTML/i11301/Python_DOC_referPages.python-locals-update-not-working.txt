<p>Why below is not working inside function but working outside?</p>
<pre><code>def foo():
    common = {'abc' : 'xyz'}
    print(locals())
    locals().update(common)
    print(locals(),abc)

foo()
</code></pre>
<p>Error : NameError: global name 'abc' is not defined</p>
<p>If i run it outside function, it works</p>
<pre><code>common = {'abc' : 'xyz'}
print(locals())
locals().update(common)
print(locals(),abc)
</code></pre>

<p>According to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#locals" rel="nofollow">locals documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note The contents of this dictionary should not be modified; changes may not affect the values of local and free variables used by the interpreter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's not working because it's not intended to work. But to answer your question now, it works in the global scope because modifying the <code>globals</code> is possible, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#globals" rel="nofollow">globals documentation</a> don't have the note telling "this [...] should not be modifyed".</p>
<p>And, obviously, when you're in the global scope, global is locals:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; globals() is locals()
True
</code></pre>
<p>So you're modifying globals, which is permitted.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe you're just contributing to the clutter and noise. Also, newbs do ask stupid questions at times as you must have at some point in your life since I am sure you're just like the rest of us.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@apesa note that you can see my questions and answers in my profile; I've had plenty of dumb questions in my time, but I've <i>done the research and answered them myself</i> (generally by finding an existing answer on SO). And if you want to stop people <i>"contributing to the clutter and the noise"</i>, start closer to home...</span>
