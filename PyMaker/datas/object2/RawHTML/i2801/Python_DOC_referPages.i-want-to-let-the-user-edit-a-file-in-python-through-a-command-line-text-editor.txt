<p>I am working on a command line text editor(similar to nano) in python and i have run into an issue regarding file editing. I can read the file, i can print it, but the user has no way of editing the file once the print instructions have been executed. I need a way of reading the text into a buffer so it stays editable to the user so it can be navigated through the arrow keys and so on. I think i need a buffer, but it doesn't seem to help? How should i proceed?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Seems like you could use <code>subprocess.Popen()</code> to execute a separate command line process (and <code>wait()</code> for it to finish). When the process ends and <code>wait()</code> return you can the process the updated file as desired. Most OS's come with some sort of basic text editor, so you could pick an appropriate one based on <code>os.name</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If it is windows you can use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6178154/open-a-text-file-using-notepad-as-a-help-file-in-python/6178200#6178200">something similar to this answer to open notepad</a>. If it is another OS you can use those as an example and just change the program being opened.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's also the text input widget named <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html#module-curses.textpad" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>curses.textpad</code></a> that provides "elementary text editing".</span>
