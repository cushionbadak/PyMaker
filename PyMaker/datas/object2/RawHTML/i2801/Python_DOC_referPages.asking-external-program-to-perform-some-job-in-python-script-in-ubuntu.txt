<p>I would like to write a script in python in ubuntu for performing some series of a task by an external program(installed in Ubuntu) multiple times. 
I can run the program for one file from the terminal but I would like to automate it by writing the python script so that it can read the files and perform the job. How should I proceed?
Thank you in advance</p>

<p>You could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system" rel="nofollow noreferrer">system</a> command, or better the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess</a> command to call your existing application. 
Subprocess would be better for your use case as you can use stdout, stderr and get status code for errors.</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess.run()</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from subprocess import run

program = './program'
files = ['f1.txt', 'f2.txt', 'f3.txt']

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for filename in files:
        run([program, filename], shell=True)
</code></pre>
<p>You could also run the program on a set of files, e.g. those that have a specific file ending, like <code>.txt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from os import listdir
from subprocess import run

program = './program'
folder = 'folder/'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    files = [folder + f for f in listdir(folder) if f.endswith('.txt')]
    for filename in files:
        run([program, filename], shell=True)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@natonomo Thank you   I tried the 2nd option but get the following error  from: can't read /var/mail/os  from: can't read /var/mail/subprocess  ./integration.py: line 5: program: command not found   ./integration.py: line 6: folder: command not found  ./integration.py: line 9: syntax error near unexpected token ('  ./integration.py: line 9: files = [f for f in listdir(folder) if f.endswith('.tif')]'  Does anyone has any idea</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dipankar Saha I just saw your comment and since it wasn't actually on my response I can't respond there. Could you please provide a formatted version of what you used to get the new errors and the traceback?</span>
