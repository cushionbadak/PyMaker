<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to build an input list where I have two options -</p>
<pre><code>domains.add_argument(
    '-d', dest='domain', required=True,
    help=   'Specify a target domain name'
)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>domain</strong> - which would take input of a domain. And the same again, but -dL (or <strong>domainlist</strong>). If a domain is parsed then domainslist isn't required, <em>but one of them must be provided.</em></p>
<p>I've tried to do this by adding both of these as required in a mutually exclusive group, however the error I'm presented with states that no objects in a mutually exclusive group can be required.</p>
<p>I could hardcode this check on startup (make neither required and handle myself) but I'm sure argparse can do it, can somebody gfive me a nudge as I haven't found this in the documentation thus far.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://kite.com/python/docs/argparse.ArgumentParser.add_mutually_exclusive_group" rel="nofollow noreferrer">add_mutually_exclusive_group()</a> function according to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html?highlight=argparse#argparse.ArgumentParser.add_mutually_exclusive_group" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> has required option that does exactly what you want:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a mutually exclusive group. argparse will make sure that only
  one of the arguments in the mutually exclusive group was present on
  the command line:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You really should include both options in your question (especially the part that makes them mutually exclusive) - and the full error message, too,</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What syntax are you planning for <code>-dL</code> to take?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Putting a required Action in a mutually exclusive group doesn't make logical sense.  'Accept A or B but not both, but A is required?'  That's why the <code>add_argument</code> raises the error.</span>
