<p>I have a question for the below code,  which is basically a function taking 2 parameters one is a column and one is a dataframe, and I'm having a hard time to understand the for loop iterating over the column and checking if values in the column is keys in the empty dictionary "langs_counts", how is it possible to check when it's an empty dictionary, please explain to me the for loop and why we put 'entry' between square brackets. </p>
<pre><code>for entry in col:
   if entry in langs_count.keys():
            langs_count[entry] += 1
   else:
            langs_count[entry] = 1

    # Define count_entries()
    def count_entries(df, col_name):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of 
    occurrences as value for each key."""

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
        langs_count = {}

        # Extract column from DataFrame: col
        col = df[col_name]

        # Iterate over lang column in DataFrame
        for entry in col:
            # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
            if entry in langs_count.keys():
                langs_count[entry] += 1
            # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
            else:
                langs_count[entry] = 1


    # Return the langs_count dictionary
    return langs_count   

    # Call count_entries(): result
    result = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')

    # Print the result
    print(result)

<p>why we put 'entry' between square brackets?</p>
<p>the thing in the square brackets is called a key.</p>
<p>It is just a simplification for indexing:</p>
<p>example code :</p>
<p>a = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': [1, 2]}</p>
<p>a["d"] = 5 in the machine it becomes: a.__setitem__("d",5)</p>
<p>if "d" does not exists as a key, it will create one.If it does,the function assign a new value to it</p>

<span class="comment-copy">When <code>lang_count</code> is an empty dictionary, then <code>entry in lang_count.keys()</code> is always False. Then the instruction <code>langs_count[entry] = 1</code> creates the key with  <code>entry</code> content associated with value 1.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is actually building the <code>lang_count</code> dictionary by counting the occurrence of a certain <code>key</code> in the data (<code>col</code>). The line <code>langs_count[entry] = 1</code> will create an entry in that dictionary with <code>key</code> <code>entry</code> if that doesn't exist.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead of using a dictionary to count stuff you can use a Counter: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@toti08   thanks for the answer, so [entry] is the key changing every time the loop goes on and if it's true it will increase the value of the current key by 1 otherwise make a new key from the current entry and give it a value of 1 ? , am I correct ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Moberg I will look into that but this is just a practice question in an online course  and I'm trying to understand it , thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I understood thank you</span>
