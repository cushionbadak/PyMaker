<p>In my MySQL database I have 10 tables.  Based on the user input, I want to select the rows from one of the table.  The user input is an image.  I am getting the number of columns and rows of pixels the image has and storing it in a variable.  </p>
<pre><code>rows,cols,channels = img.shape
w = int(cols)
h = int(rows)
l = w-10
m = w+10
p = h-10
q = h+10
area = w*h
</code></pre>
<p>the mysql tables are created basis the area of the image, and hence, depending on the area, I want to select the values from a specific table.</p>
<pre><code>if (area &lt; 110980):
        sql = "select * from adf1 where WIDTH between %s and %s and HEIGHT between %s and %s;",(l,m,p,q)
    elif (area &lt; 182520):
        sql = "select * from adf2 where WIDTH between %s and %s and HEIGHT between %s and %s;",(l,m,p,q)
else:
        sql = "select * from adf10 where WIDTH between %s and %s and HEIGHT between %s and %s;",(l,m,p,q)
cur = mysql.connect().cursor()
cur.execute(sql)
</code></pre>
<p>I am getting the following error:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'tuple' objects
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I pass on a single query within <code>cur.execute</code> I am able to retrieve the results.</p>
<pre><code>cur.execute("select * from adf10 where WIDTH between %s and %s and HEIGHT between %s and %s;",(l,m,p,q))
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>current your variable <code>sql</code> is tuple, so if you want to pass it as parameters to the <code>execute</code> you should use <code>*</code></p>
<pre><code>cur.execute(*sql)
</code></pre>
<p>you can read more in the doc <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">unpacking-argument-lists</a></p>

<p>this should fix your problem. You need to use <code>%</code> not comma in the queries inside if else.</p>
<pre><code>"select * from adf2 where WIDTH between %s and %s and HEIGHT between %s and %s;"%(l,m,p,q)
</code></pre>
