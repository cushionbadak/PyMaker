<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Suppose I have this program:</p>
<pre><code>class Edit(self):
   print("something")
class mainclass(self):
    def mainmenu(self):
        button1 = Button(root,text = "Edit",command = Edit)
</code></pre>
<p>How can I call a class from a class with a button? Note: This is just an example.
Thanks.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I used Qt for this example : </p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
from Qt import QtWidgets
import sys

class MainWidget(QtWidgets.QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MainWidget, self).__init__()
        #Layout creation
        layout = QtWidgets.QVBoxLayout(self)
        self.setLayout(layout)

        #Widgets creation
        self.button = QtWidgets.QPushButton("button")

        #Layout connections
        layout.addWidget(self.button)

        #Widget connections
        self.button.released.connect(self.call_edit)

    def call_edit_class(self):
        """
        Creates an instance of Edit class
        """
        edit_instance = Edit()


class Edit() :
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Will print "Something" at the initialization step , as soon as the instance is created
        """
        print ("Something")

def main():
    global widg
    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
    widg = MainWidget()
    widg.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>However this is not a good practice ,You better create a function inside the MainWidget class that print "Something" whenever you push the button.</p>
<p>Example : 
def button_pushed(self):
    print ("Something")</p>
<p>That you will call using : 
self.button.released.connect(self.button_pushed)</p>
<p>This is more simple , so better :) 
Hope it was helpful.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Shouldn't the print("something") statement be in the body of a function instead of a class? Because the code you provided does not compile. I.e. shouldn't the <code>Edit</code> be a function of mainclass?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>self</code> in the context of class creation? Also, what is a <code>Button</code>? What UI framework are you using, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Tk</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I forgot to mention that, I use tkinter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks,  <code>code </code>def call_edit_class(self):         edit_instance = Edit() worked for tkinter aswell. Why do you use pyqt? What advantages does it have over tkinter?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welcome :) I never used tkinter , but Qt corresponds to my needs. It is a multiple platforms framework and works for all Major OS. Also very used in the CG industry and cross DCC :)  A bit hard at the beggining (At least for me :D ) but very powerful. It is also a very good practice to understand the classes , I recommand.</span>
