<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Let's say I have a textfile which is built like this:</p>
<pre><code>text "car"
translation ""

text "tree"
translation ""
</code></pre>
<p>Now I'm trying to translate this file with Python and I have figured out how to translate strings with googletrans and how to read a file but I can't figure out how to actually read what's within the quotation marks only.</p>
<p>This is how far I have gotten</p>
<pre><code>from googletrans import Translator
f = open('file.txt','r')
translator = Translator()
text=f.read()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can get just the values inside the quotes by using the very helpful <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shlex</code></a> module, which provides utilities for parsing shell-like syntaxes:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import shlex
&gt;&gt;&gt; shlex.split('text "car"')
['text', 'car']
</code></pre>
<p>Note that in addition to stripping the quotation marks, this supports spaces, and escaped quotes, etc:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; shlex.split(r'text "a thing with spaces and literal \"s in it"')
['text', 'a thing with spaces and literal "s in it']
</code></pre>
<p>You can hook this up to your file with something like:</p>
<pre><code>with open('file.txt','r') as file_:
    for line in file_:
        parsed = shlex.split(line)
        if parsed[0] == "text":
             # do translation with with parsed[1]
        else:
             # do something else
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>line.split('"')[1]</code>?</span>
