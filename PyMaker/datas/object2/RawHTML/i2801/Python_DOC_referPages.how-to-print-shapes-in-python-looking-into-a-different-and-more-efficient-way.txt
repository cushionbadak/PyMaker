<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Have tried many ways, such as printing line by line:</p>
<p>print (" ------- ")</p>
<p>print ("|       |")
print ("|       |")</p>
<p>print (" ------- ")</p>
<p>Also with * ,</p>
<p>print ("********")</p>
<p>print ("*      <em>")
print ("</em>      *")</p>
<p>print ("********")</p>
<p>Personally, I think the dashes (-) look more smooth than the stars(*). Any other ways to do this?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Which of these would you rather have:</p>
<pre><code>┌────────┐
│        │
│        │
└────────┘

 --------
|        |
|        |
 --------
</code></pre>
<p>Unless you need to output pure ASCII for some reason—or you're going for that retro APPLE ][ look—you should draw boxes with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character" rel="nofollow noreferrer">box-drawing characters</a>. And it's really not much harder than drawing them with hyphens and pipes and other things not meant to be used for line drawing:</p>
<pre><code>horiz = '\u2500'
vert = '\u2502'
ul = '\u250c'
ur = '\u2510'
ll = '\u2514'
lr = '\u2518'

def box(width, height):
  top = ul + horiz*(width-2) + ur
  middle = vert + ' '*(width-2) + vert
  bottom = ll + horiz*(width-2) + lr
  lines = [top] + [middle]*(height-2) + [bottom]
  return '\n'.join(lines)

print(box(10, 4))
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>It's sometimes even easier to grab a library off PyPI that does what you want, like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/terminaltables/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>terminaltables</code></a> for drawing tables with borders, or <a href="https://pypi.org/project" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>asciitree</code></a> for drawing trees like the DOS and Unix tree commands, etc.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Or, depending on what you're trying to do, maybe you actually wanted to write a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>curses</code></a> or <a href="http://urwid.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>urwid</code></a> or similar full-screen console app, and let it draw boxes around your windows.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Guff way:</p>
<pre><code>def box(w,h):
   s='┌%s┐'%('─'*w)
   for i in range(int(h/2)):
      s+='\n│%s│'%(' '*w)
   s+='\n└%s┘'%('─'*w)
   return s

print(box(5,5))

<span class="comment-copy">What shape exactly are you trying to print?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And also, make sure to read the guide on proper question writing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character" rel="nofollow noreferrer">box-drawing characters</a> instead (like <a href="https://repl.it/repls/DeepLongBookmarks" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a>)? Or grab a library off PyPI that does it for you?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you asking about "efficient" here? You can probably squeeze out a few nanoseconds by building one big string and printing that, instead of doing 4 separate <code>print</code>s, but I can't imagine when that would ever matter (especially since the actual displaying on the console or saving to a file will probably take something like 1000x as long as that anyway).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why give a novice code golf when they're not asking for it?</span>
