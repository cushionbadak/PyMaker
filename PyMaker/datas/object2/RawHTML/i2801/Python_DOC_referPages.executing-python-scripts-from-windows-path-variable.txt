<p>I have Python 3.7 on my path (I can execute <code>.py</code> scripts when I am in that local directory in <code>cmd</code>)</p>
<p>I also have a folder of scripts on my path (I can open them from any local directory in <code>cmd</code> i.e. by typing "script.py")</p>
<p>However, I cannot execute these scripts from any local directory explicitly using <code>python</code>, i.e. "python script.py"</p>
<p>Any ideas why this is the case? Thanks</p>
<p>Edit:
The desired folder "scripts" is set in PYTHONPATH variable, and checking within python I see</p>
<blockquote>
<p>import sys</p>
<p>sys.path</p>
<p>['', 'C:\Users\benma\Desktop\scripts',...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can import a file from scripts into python already running, but not execute it directly</p>

<p>Python doesn't search <code>PATH</code> to look for your scripts. You can run the script directly because the <em>shell</em> is searching <code>PATH</code> looking for something that matches.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>PYTHONPATH</code></a> won't help when executing from the shell. It is only used by Python when importing modules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Augment the default search path for module files. </p>

<p>I don't think you're going to get exactly what you're after. The closest is probably <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/ExecutableModules" rel="nofollow noreferrer">executable modules</a>.</p>
