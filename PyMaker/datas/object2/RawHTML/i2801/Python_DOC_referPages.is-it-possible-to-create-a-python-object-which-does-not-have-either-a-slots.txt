<p>Is it possible to create a python object which does not have either a <code>__slots__</code> a <code>__dict__</code>?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As pointed out in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9502183/python-why-is-dict-attribute-not-in-built-in-class-instances">SO</a> python classes defined in C have no <code>__dict__</code> attribute. So yeah, it is possible and this is how you get built-in classes that don't have it, such as <code>str</code>. </p>
<p>Other than that... if you look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">data model</a> the <code>__dict__</code> is used to hold the namespace for user defined modules, classes and functions. So you'll get that attribute even when you define a new class that inherits from a built in class which doesn't have it. (such as str)</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class ob(str):
...    pass
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; o = ob()
&gt;&gt;&gt; o.__dict__
{}
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you want to restrict access to the class' members? If so, and if you're stuck with python, then you're SOL.</span>
