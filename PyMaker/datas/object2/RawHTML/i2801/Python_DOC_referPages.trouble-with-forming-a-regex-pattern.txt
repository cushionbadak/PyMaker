<p>I have a multi-line document, from which I have to extract a specific part. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>ID: 58101 \n LOCATIONS: Yerevan, Armenia \n
  _info:  Aregak was established in 1997 by United Methodist Committee on Relief, an international NGO is headquartered in New-York, NY, USA.
  In 2006 Aregak UCO CJSC obtained license to carry out full range
  credit services in Armenia. The organization operates in ten marzes of
  Armenia and throughout Nagorno Karabakh. Aregak Head Office is located
  in Yerevan. \n START_DA: 28 November 2013</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is what I ame up with "^_info:(\n|.)*START_DA:" Problem is it highlights start_da as well. I want to make it like whatever the word there is if it detects a ":" at the end of the word, (START_DA:) stop and not include that word. So my target is in layman terms from _info: to ..headoffice is located in Yerevan. Please advice. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can make <code>START_DA:</code> part of a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">positive lookahead</a> expression instead:</p>
<pre><code>^_info:(\n|.)*(?=START_DA:)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Wow thank you so much, I spent 2 days trying to figure this out! Appreciate it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What if I want to say the word can be anything and not just STAR_DA but all the words will end with a  : is that possible? So instead of START_DA: if I have HEY: or anything really</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure. You can use <code>^_info:(\n|.)*?(?=\w+:)</code> instead then.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi Blhsing one question about  that regex you made: ^_info:(\n|.)*?(?=\w+:)  Let's say the end line has START DA without the underscore, how do I handle that? Because when I try this code it kinda highlights START as well! Would appreciate your advice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Simply removing underscore from that regex should work, i.e. <code>^_info:(\n|.)*(?=START DA:)</code></span>
