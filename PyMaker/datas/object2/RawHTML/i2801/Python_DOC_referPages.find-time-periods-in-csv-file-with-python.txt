<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>I have a .csv file that contains values with temperatures and a timestamp when the temperature was measured. What I want to do is to find time periods where the value goes done below a specific value. I wanna do it without a database, I know it is easy with mysql or something else. 
This is a private project to learn statistics with python. </p>
<h3>Datastructure</h3>
<pre><code>001,"2018-8-15 08:00:00", 89
002,"2018-8-15 08:00:30", 68
003,"2018-8-15 08:01:00", 56
004,"2018-8-15 08:01:30", 55
005,"2018-8-15 08:02:00", 56
006,"2018-8-15 08:02:30", 63
</code></pre>
<p>One file contains 720 Entries for everyday. </p>
<h3>What is my idea?</h3>
<pre><code>   with open('2018815') as file:
     for line in files:
       s = line.strip().split(",")

       if s[3] == "temperature":
         continue

       if int(s[3]) &lt; 60:
         setStart()

       if int(s[3]) &gt; 60:
         setEnd()
</code></pre>
<p>The functions <code>setStart</code> and <code>setEnd</code> are not implemented yet, because I found a mistake in my thoughts. When I ran the code and just printed the values I found out that also the periods within the periods where also defined as a period. </p>
<h3>What are  my questions?</h3>
<ol>
<li>How to skip the periods within periods?</li>
<li>Is there a library I could use, to solve this problem more easily?</li>
</ol>

<p>as suggested above, pandas is the library you need, but if you want to do it with a loop on the lines you can still add a boolean to forget to add start while you are on a periode:</p>
<pre><code>with open('2018815') as file:
     is_in_periode = False
     for line in files:
       s = line.strip().split(",")

       if s[3] == "temperature":
         continue

       if(int(s[3]) &lt; 60 and not is_in_periode):
         setStart()
         is_in_periode = True

       if(int(s[3]) &gt; 60 and is_in_periode):
         setEnd()
         is_in_periode = False
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You should consider using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code> module</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you able to use the pandas library? It's designed for this kind of thing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks I will have a look on the <code>csv</code> module. @roganjosh I will also have a look at pandas libraries. I think it should not be a problem to use it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It worked properly, thanks!</span>
