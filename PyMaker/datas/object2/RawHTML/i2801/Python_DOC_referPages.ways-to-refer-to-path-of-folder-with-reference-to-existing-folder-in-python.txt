<p>I would like to point to location of certain folder using current folder as a reference.</p>
<p>I would like to do something neat like this in python. It looks simple and readable.</p>
<pre><code>directory_1 = "../data"
directory_2 = "../../data2"  # refer to parent folder
</code></pre>
<p>I am using python v3.6</p>
<p>EDIT: I made a mistake for <code>directory_1</code>. It is easy to get it in python by using <code>directory_1 = "./data"</code>. One dot, not 2 dots.</p>

<pre><code>from pathlib import Path

directory_1 = Path("../data").resolve()
directory_2 = Path("../../data2").resolve()

<span class="comment-copy">What's wrong with what you have? Pretty much every OS python runs on will understand those paths as is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I could not get it to work in Windows 10. I had to use <code>os.getcwd()</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why did you have to use it? Show a minimal reproducible example where that would be necessary please.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">IIRC Windows pathing uses backslashes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">os.getcwd() can work for current folder. There is no neat way to get parent folder.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why the extra layer? +1 for introducing a valuable tool though.</span>
