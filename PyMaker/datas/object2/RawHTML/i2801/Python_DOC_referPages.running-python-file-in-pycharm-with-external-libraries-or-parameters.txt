<p>I have a script connecting to Oracle DB while doing the job. This connection required external libraries from third party like Oracle common driver.</p>
<p>I found the way to add system viariables to the console in PyCharm so I can run my program properly in PyCharm python console. However when I try regular run (or debug) button it does not run complaining for lack of these libraries.
How can I define such variables/libraries to enable running my program directly?</p>

<p>Try to create a virtual environment specifically for this project (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html</a>). </p>
<p>After creating select this virtual environment and try to install the necessary libraries in File-&gt; Settings-&gt; Project Interpreter.</p>

<p>On MacOS, I am running cx_Oracle 5.3 with Django 1.11 and Oracle 11g. I defined the following environment variables in the run/debug configuration of pyCharm:</p>

<p>If you are running Windows then you will need to amend the paths accordingly...</p>

<span class="comment-copy">In order to add external libraries to global or virtualenv. You simply download them at: File-&gt;Settings-&gt;Project: project_name -&gt; Project Interpeter (then click 'plus' button and find what you are looking for).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think that PyCharm is creating such environment for me out of the box so  I don't have to do that. Bt the question remains: how to add all the libs I need there?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you update to cx_Oracle 6, note that cx_Oracle installation is significantly different, and also that macOS SIP means DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH isn't useful.
