<p>then i get this error: 'Turtle' object has no attribute 'register_shape'</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.register_shape" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>register_shape</code></a> is not a method on <code>Turtle</code> objects, it's a global function.</p>
<p>So, instead of this:</p>
<pre><code>turt.register_shape('player.png')
</code></pre>
<p>â€¦ do this:</p>
<pre><code>turtle.register_shape('player.png')
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Also, notice that you don't have any use for that <code>turt</code> turtle. Your app only wants to display a single turtle, <code>p</code>, so don't create any others.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Finally, even after you fix this:</p>
<p>At least according to the docs, only GIF images are supported, but you're trying to use a PNG image. The docs may be wrong about that, but there's a good chance they're right, and this is going to fail.</p>
<p>If so, the only way to fix it is to use some other program (it could be one you write yourself in 4 lines of Pillow code, or it could be something like MSPaint or Preview, or a command-line tool like ImageMagick convert) to make a GIF image out of your PNG image.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">actually their are more turtles its just that I'm trying to add the picture to that turtle so i only sent that much code. If that is a problem please tell how I can fix it</span>
