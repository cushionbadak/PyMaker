<p>Is there anyway I can use any pgsql driver without actually installing it? I see <code>Psycopg2</code> is most commonly used for connecting to PGSQL database but that need installing and The issue I have here is I need to distribute the code but the we are not allowed to install anything on the server. Anything standalone (e.g. including the driver/library files in a directory along with my scripts) but that's the only thing I can do. Is there any way I can <code>import</code> psycopg2 from a local directory?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Yes, you can import modules from local files - you can even import whole python files of your own if you want. You can download the <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2?files=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">source code</a> and put it onto your system by using a USB stick (if permitted). However, you <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/blob/master/doc/src/install.rst" rel="nofollow noreferrer">will still have to install it</a> which may not be possible depending on your situation. If this is for homework or a school project, I recommend only using files or libraries you create or are provided with. <br/>You can read more about Python imports here <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html</a> Best of luck.</p>
