<p>I haven't been coding for awhile and trying to get back into Python. I'm trying to write a simple program that sums an array by adding each array element value to a sum. This is what I have:</p>
<pre><code>def sumAnArray(ar):
    theSum = 0
    for i in ar:
        theSum = theSum + ar[i]
    print(theSum)
    return theSum
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>line 13, theSum = theSum + ar[i]
IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>
<p>I found that what I'm trying to do is apparently as simple as this:</p>
<pre><code>sum(ar)
</code></pre>
<p>But clearly I'm not iterating through the array properly anyway, and I figure it's something I will need to learn properly for other purposes. Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you loop in an array like you did, your for variable(in this example <code>i</code>) is current element of your array.</p>
<p>For example if your <code>ar</code> is <code>[1,5,10]</code>, the <code>i</code> value in each iteration is <code>1</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>10</code>.
And because your array length is 3, the maximum index you can use is 2. so when <code>i = 5</code> you get <code>IndexError</code>.
You should change your code into something like this:</p>
<pre><code>for i in ar:
    theSum = theSum + i
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you want to use indexes, you should create a range from 0 ro <code>array length - 1</code>.</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(ar)):
    theSum = theSum + ar[i]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The for loop iterates over the elements of the array, not its indexes.
Suppose you have a list ar = [2, 4, 6]:</p>
<p>When you iterate over it with <code>for i in ar:</code> the values of i will be 2, 4 and 6. So, when you try to access <code>ar[i]</code> for the first value, it might work (as the last position of the list is 2, a[2] equals 6), but not for the latter values, as a[4] does not exist.</p>
<p>If you intend to use indexes anyhow, try using <code>for index, value in enumerate(ar):</code>, then <code>theSum = theSum + ar[index]</code> should work just fine.</p>

<p>You can use     </p>
<pre><code>    nditer
</code></pre>
<p>Here I calculated no. of positive and negative coefficients in a logistic regression:</p>
<pre><code>b=sentiment_model.coef_
pos_coef=0
neg_coef=0
for i in np.nditer(b):
    if i&gt;0:
    pos_coef=pos_coef+1
    else:
    neg_coef=neg_coef+1
print("no. of positive coefficients is : {}".format(pos_coef))
print("no. of negative coefficients is : {}".format(neg_coef))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>no. of positive coefficients is : 85035
no. of negative coefficients is : 36199
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>i</code> is the value of the item you're looping over in the array... so if you had 3 items <code>[10, 11, 12]</code> you're trying on the first iteration of accessing <code>ar[10]</code> which won't work... You could just use the builtin <code>sum</code>, eg: <code>sum(ar)</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JonClements you will notice that I mentioned sum(ar) in my original question as an easier way to do it. I am asking how to properly iterate over array elements.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">(sorry - somehow glanced over that bit) you can just change your loop to be <code>theSum += ar</code>...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want to use the INDEX of each element, rather than the value of each element in a list, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enumerate</a></span>
