<p>I made a GUI in Python and i just wanted to know how can i import a C file into python so every time a button is clicked on my GUI, different methods in the C program will be executed. I tried the 'Python' method of importing:</p>
<pre><code>sys.path.insert(0, '/home/pi/Desktop/FTPclass.py')
import FTPclass
</code></pre>
<p>That worked for the python file i imported, but when I do the same for my c file, it complains saying my "testinc" module doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone help in advance.

<p>To use c file according to docs you need to first compile C code and then use the compiled file in your code</p>
<p>here is the link.

<span class="comment-copy">Do you want to call single functions from your c file or do you want to call a compiled program?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">single functions. I would like every button to be unique.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"every time a button is clicked on my GUI, the C program will be executed": that sounds like you want to run the program as a separate executable (possibly passing additional input and capturing the output). Certainly if the GUI is just a layer on top of/wrapper around the C program. Perhaps the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>subprocess</code></a> module can help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In addition to the question linked in the previous comment (which is about calling C functions from Python), check out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/89228/1782792">Calling an external command in Python</a>. You may be able to compile our C code normally into a program and call that program from Python. What you definitely cannot do is executing uncompiled C code from Python (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/9420673">Is it possible to compile c code using python?</a> on that topic).</span>
