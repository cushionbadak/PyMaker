<p>I want to remove commas from one sentence and separate all the other words(a-z) and print them one by one.</p>
<pre><code>a = input()
b=list(a)                      //to remove punctuations
for item in list(b):           //to prevent "index out of range" error. 
    for j in range(len(l)):
        if(item==','):
            b.remove(item)
            break
c="".join(b)                  //sentence without commas
c=c.split()
print(c)
</code></pre>
<p>My input is :</p>
<pre><code>The university was founded as a standard academy,and developed to a university of technology by Habib Nafisi.
</code></pre>
<p>and when I remove the comma:</p>
<pre><code>... founded as a standard academyand developed to a university...
</code></pre>
<p>and when I split the words:</p>
<pre><code>The
university
.
.
.
academyand
.
.
.
</code></pre>
<p>what can I do to prevent this?
I already tried replace method and it doesn't work.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could replace <code>,</code> with a space assuming there is no space between <code>,</code> and next word in your input <sup>1</sup> and then perform <code>split</code>:</p>
<pre><code>s = 'The university was founded as a standard academy,and developed to a university of technology by Habib Nafisi.'

print(s.replace(',', ' ').split())
# ['The', 'university', 'was', 'founded', 'as', 'a', 'standard', 'academy', 'and', 'developed', 'to', 'a', 'university', 'of', 'technology', 'by', 'Habib', 'Nafisi.']
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could also try your hand at <code>regex</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import re

s = 'The university was founded as a standard academy,and developed to a university of technology by Habib Nafisi.'

print(re.split(r' |,', s))
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p><sup>1</sup><sub><em>Note</em>: This works even if you had space (multiple) after <code>,</code> because ultimately you <code>split</code> on whitespace.</sub></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your issue seems to be that there is no space between the comma and the next word here: <code>academy,and</code> You could solve this by ensuring that there is a space so when you use <code>b=list(a)</code> that function will actually separate each word into a different element of the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is probably what you want, I see you forgot to <code>replace</code> comma with space. </p>
<pre><code>stri = """ The university was founded as a standard academy,and developed to a university of technology by Habib Nafisi."""
stri.replace(",", " ")
print(stri.split())
</code></pre>
<p>Will give you the output in a list: </p>
<pre><code>['The', 'university', 'was', 'founded', 'as', 'a', 'standard', 'academy,and', 'developed', 'to', 'a', 'university', 'of', 'technology', 'by', 'Habib', 'Nafisi.']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you consider words to be a series of characters that are separated by spaces, if you replace a , with nothing, then there will be no space between them, and it will consider it one word.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to replace the comma with a space, and then split based on spaces:</p>
<pre><code>my_string = "The university was founded as a standard academy,and developed to a university of technology by Habib Nafisi."
list_of_words = my_string.replace(",", " ").split()
</code></pre>
