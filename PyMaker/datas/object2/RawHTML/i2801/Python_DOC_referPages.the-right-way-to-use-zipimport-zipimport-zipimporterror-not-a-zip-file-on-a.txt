<p>I have managed to use <a href="https://github.com/soimort/you-get/releases" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this module</a> without installation - just import it from path to use , </p>
<pre><code>import sys 
url = 'https://example.com'

from you_get import common

</code></pre>
<p>It seems possible in Python to use <code>zipimport</code> to directly use the zip archive of the module without extraction, I wonder what is the right way to use <code>zipimport</code>, a simple trying like the following just gives the exception . I downloaded the file from <a href="https://github.com/soimort/you-get/archive/v0.4.1128.zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> , the file <code>C:\Users\i\Downloads\you-get-0.4.1128.zip</code> does exist and isn't corrupted. </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import zipimport 
&gt;&gt;&gt; zipimport.zipimporter(r'C:\Users\i\Downloads\you-get-0.4.1128.zip') 
Traceback (most recent call last):

<p><sub>(This is the suggested way of action that answers your question: "The right way to use <code>zipimport</code>"; see further below for the immediate cause of your error.)</sub></p>
<p><strong>You shouldn't use <code>zipimport</code> directly. Instead, you should add the <code>.zip</code> file to <code>sys.path</code> -- it will be used as if it was a directory.</strong></p>
<p>That said, the file you downloaded is a <em>source distribution</em> -- it has a <code>setup.py</code> in root and the actual modules in a subdirectory. To use the module, you need <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/builtdist.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a <em>built</em> distribution</a> instead.</p>
<p>Telling all about source and built distributions is beyond the scope of a single answer. One possible way to go is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>unpack the <code>.zip</code></li>
<li>make a wheel using its <code>setup.py</code> with <code>python setup.py bdist_wheel</code> and</li>
<li>install it with <code>pip install &lt;path to .whl&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Debugging with Visual Studio shows that this is the code that it chokes on:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.6.5/Modules/zipimport.c#L917" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>v3.6.5</code>,<code>Modules\zipimport.c</code></a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-c prettyprint-override"><code>if (fseek(fp, -22, SEEK_END) == -1) {
    &lt;...&gt;
}
header_position = (unsigned long)ftell(fp);
&lt;...&gt;
if (fread(buffer, 1, 22, fp) != 22) {
    &lt;...&gt;
}
if (get_uint32(buffer) != 0x06054B50u) {
    /* Bad: End of Central Dir signature */
    errmsg = "not a Zip file";
    goto invalid_header;
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it reads and validates the last 22 bytes of the file as an <a href="https://pkware.cachefly.net/webdocs/casestudies/APPNOTE.TXT" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"end of central dir signature"</a>.</p>
<p>The spec says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4.3.1 A ZIP file MUST contain an "end of central directory record".</p>
<p>&lt;...&gt;</p>
<p>4.3.6 Overall .ZIP file format:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;...&gt;
[end of central directory record]
</code></pre>
<p>4.3.16  End of central directory record:</p>
<pre><code>  end of central dir signature    4 bytes  (0x06054b50)
  number of this disk             2 bytes
  number of the disk with the
  start of the central directory  2 bytes
  total number of entries in the
  central directory on this disk  2 bytes
  total number of entries in
  the central directory           2 bytes
  size of the central directory   4 bytes
  offset of start of central
  directory with respect to
  the starting disk number        4 bytes
  .ZIP file comment length        2 bytes
  .ZIP file comment       (variable size)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, this "End of central directory record" is 22 bytes.. <em>without the comment</em>. And this file does have a comment:</p>
<pre><code>$ xxd -s 0x322b5 -g 1 you-get-0.4.1128.zip

<p>So this is a bug. <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue25711" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here's a relevant ticket.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have downloaded the file and have the same exception, though file seems to be legit.</p>
<p>Maybe you should use <code>zipfile</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import zipfile
&gt;&gt;&gt; zipfile.ZipFile( 'you-get-0.4.1128.zip' )
&lt;zipfile.ZipFile object at 0x7fc515343c50&gt;

<span class="comment-copy">Naive question: is that really a Zip file? What are its ~50 first bytes?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ivan_pozdeev I downloaded the file from <a href="https://github.com/soimort/you-get/archive/v0.4.1128.zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/soimort/you-get/archive/v0.4.1128.zip</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">double click that file in explorer, can you see the file list or anything?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@lenik Yes, I could open it with Bandizip</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks to your explanation , I extract the zip archive and then add the extracted to a zip archive using Bandizip, this time <code>zipimport.zipimporter(r'C:\Users\i\Downloads\you-get-0.4.1128.zip') </code> doesn't give the exception , but still cannot import the module, even adding the  <code>.zip</code>  file to  <code>sys.path</code>, tested code here <a href="https://bpaste.net/show/243292a2d4a6" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bpaste.net/show/243292a2d4a6</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@iMath See the text after <i>"That said..."</i>. You need to either make a built distribution from that archive or download and install the <code>.whl</code> from the same site instead. Unless you have some special needs, this is the standard approach to 3rd-party packages.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What I actually want to do is to use the module from a pyinstaller frozen application  , I also need to upgrade  the module  to latest version whenever needed , I cannot find a solution yet.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@iMath Ask a separate question about that, accurately and in detail describing your use scenarios (=what you have and what you're trying to achieve). The information you gave is not enough to get the full picture, and it sounds like a large enough matter for another full question and answer. Finally, it's a completely separate matter (organizing your modules for some use scenario) from what you asked here (a problem importing from a specific .zip file), and SO is one-concern-per-question to stay useful for future readers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@iMath Looked deeper. This is a bug.</span>
