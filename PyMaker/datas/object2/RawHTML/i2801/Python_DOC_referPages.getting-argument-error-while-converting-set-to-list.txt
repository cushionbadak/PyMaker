<p>In pure python this should work. It <code>ipdb</code>, <code>list</code> is a command that overrides the normal python <code>list</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb/issues/106" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/gotcha/ipdb/issues/106</a>, which mentions that you should write it as</p>
<pre><code>!l = list(different_aois)

<span class="comment-copy">What does <code>different_aois</code> look like?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is <code>different_aois</code>? Can you show us what <code>print(different_aois)</code> prints?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">The <code>ipdb</code> header suggests that you're not in an ordinary REPL, but rather in an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">interactive debugger</a> prompt. You can't enter arbitrary python statements into a debugger. Try quitting the prompt (perhaps with the q key), and re-enter your REPL normally.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kevin: you are right. I was in the debugger mode and modifying existing objects so it was not working.</span>
