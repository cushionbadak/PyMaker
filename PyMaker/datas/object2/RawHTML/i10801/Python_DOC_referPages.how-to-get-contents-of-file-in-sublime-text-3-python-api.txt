<p>I'm very new to Python and Sublime Text API dev... so this may be easy?</p>
<p>I want to display the contents of a file (that sits next to the currently open file) to a new panel window. </p>
<p>I can create a new panel no problem and get it to display a string using </p>
<pre><code>def newLogWindow(self, output):
    window = self.view.window()

    new_view = window.create_output_panel("log")
    new_view.run_command('erase_view')
    new_view.run_command('append', {'characters': output})
    window.run_command("show_panel", {"panel": "output.log"})

    sublime.status_message('Metalang')

pass
</code></pre>
<p>But what I need is a function to get contents of file to pass to that function.</p>
<pre><code>content = xxxx.open_file("filename.txt")
// somehow get contents of this file?
// pass it to log window
self.newLogWindow(content);
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
</div>

<p>In Sublime Text, the built in API to open a file is tied to the <code>Window</code> and will return a <code>View</code> that corresponds to a tab. In your case, you want to update a panel (an existing <code>View</code> that doesn't relate to a tab) with the contents of the file, so the Sublime Text API can't be used for this.</p>
<p>Instead you can do it directly in Python using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow"><code>open</code> method</a>:</p>
<pre><code>with open('filename.txt', 'r') as myfile:
    content = myfile.read()
    self.newLogWindow(content)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for that @keith-hall.. "Works" except for all the NUL's I can see in the output -&gt; <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/iepdg00pobmshp6/Capture.PNG?raw=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dropbox.com/s/iepdg00pobmshp6/Capture.PNG?raw=1</a>. Any idea how to get rid of those?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@markstewie what encoding was your <code>filename.txt</code> saved with? you may need to specify it as part of the <code>open</code> call - <code>open('filename.txt', 'r', encoding='UTF-8')</code> for example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm, that doesn't work but definitely something to do with encoding... I've copied contents of real file to new test file and works as expected. So I need to work out how to change content type of file..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Found out the file encoding of the log file I'm trying to read is utf16be</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@markstewie then I think it should work with <code>encoding='utf-16be'</code></span>
