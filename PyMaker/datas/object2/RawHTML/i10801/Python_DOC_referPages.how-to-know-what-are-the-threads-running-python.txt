<p>Is there any way to know what threads are running using python threading module. With the following piece of code, I am able to get the Thread name, current thread, active thread count.</p>
<p>But my doubt here is ACTIVE_THREADS are 2 and the CURRENT THREAD is always "MainThread". What could be the other thread which is running at the back ground ?</p>
<pre><code>import threading
import time

for _ in range(10):
    time.sleep(3)
    print("\n", threading.currentThread().getName())
    print("current thread", threading.current_thread())
    print("active threads ", threading.active_count())
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<h2>output of the above the code :</h2>
<p>MainThread</p>
<p>current thread &lt;_MainThread(MainThread, started 11008)&gt;</p>
<p>active threads  2</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can access all current thread objects using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.enumerate" rel="nofollow"><code>threading.enumerate()</code></a>, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>for thread in threading.enumerate():
    print(thread.name)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">If the above code is your full program, it should show only a single thread, since it isn't launching any other ones.</span>
