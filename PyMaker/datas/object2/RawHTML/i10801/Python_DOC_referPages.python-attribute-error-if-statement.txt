<p>I have been working on this code for about a day now. A few hours on just this one part it keeps saying I have an attribute error on line 26. Unfortunately that is all the information I have. I have tried countless different ways to fix it and have searched many websites/forums. I appreciate any help. Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>import itertools
def answer(x, y, z):
    monthdays = {31,
                 28,
                 31, 
                 30, 
                 31, 
                 30, 
                 31, 
                 31, 
                 30, 
                 31, 
                 30, 
                 31}
    real_outcomes = set()
    MONTH = 0
    DAY = 1
    YEAR = 2

    #perms = [[x, y, z],[x, z, y],[y, z, x],[y, x, z],[z, x, y],[z, y, x]]
    possibilities = itertools.permutations([x, y, z])
    for perm in possibilities:
        month_test = perm[MONTH]
        day_test = perm[DAY]
        #I keep receiving an attribute error on the line below
*       if month_test &lt;= 12 and day_test &lt;= monthdays.get(month_test):
            real_outcomes.add(perm)

    if len(realOutcomes) &gt; 1:
        return "Ambiguous"
    else:
        return "%02d/%02d/%02d" % realOutcomes.pop()
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that <code>monthdays</code> does not have a <code>get()</code> method, and that is because <code>monthdays</code> is a <code>set</code>, not a <code>dict</code> as you probably expect.</p>
<p>Looking at your code it seems that a list or tuple would be appropriate for <code>monthdays</code>. A set is not useful because it is not ordered and can not include duplicates:</p>
<pre><code>monthdays = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
</code></pre>
<p>and then:</p>
<pre><code>if month_test &lt; len(monthdays) and day_test &lt;= monthdays[month_test]:
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Your code suggests that you eventually will want to handle years. In that case you should look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html" rel="nofollow"><code>calendar</code></a> module. It provides function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.monthrange" rel="nofollow"><code>monthrange()</code></a> that gives the number of days for a given year and month, and it handles leap years.</p>
<pre><code>from calendar import monthrange

try: 
    if 1 &lt;= perm[DAY] &lt;= monthrange(perms[YEAR], perm[MONTH])[1]:
        real_outcomes.add(perm)
except ValueError as exc:
    print(exc)    # or pass if don't care
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>set objects ('monthdays' in your case) don't have attribute 'get'</p>
<p>you should iterate over it or convert it to list, e.g.:</p>
<p><code>list(monthdays)[0]</code> will return the first item of the resulting list</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just a quick question, why wouldn't be a dict? +1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PythonMaster: because that is the syntax for declaring a <code>set</code>. A dictionary contains keys <i>and</i> values, not just values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I actually just changed it to a dict and it works perfectly! as I said I'm a bit new to python. I am also going to try a version with the code you gave. I appreciate the help! I thought the colon would have spliced it instead of set a key</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TrevorMurphy: you can use a dictionary, however, you are simply emulating a list by using the list indices as dictionary keys. Having said that, a dictionary might be better because you can map the month days to 1-based keys (which you are probably using), resulting in more readable code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A set can not contain duplicates, and there is no inherent order. Thus iteration or conversion to a list will not be helpful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what does my snippet have to do with duplicates and inherent order? I am just showing how he can get items from it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try running your code and you should see the problem that I raise.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there are no errors in it, try yourself maybe</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The point is, @Bob, that the OP wants the number of days for each month. However, <code>monthdays</code> is a set, so it will actually look like this: <code>set([28, 30, 31])</code>. Converting that to a list with <code>list(monthdays)</code> gives <code>[28, 30, 31]</code>. How will the OP determine from this the number of days in June? Similarly iteration does not help either because it will merely iterate over the 3 items in the set. That's why I advised you to try your suggestion so that you may see the problem for yourself. Also, your answer is not useful, so I downvoted it too. Sorry, but that's how SO works.</span>
