<p>Was looking for a method to delete files using a wildcard. Came across <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5532498/delete-files-with-python-through-os-shell?answertab=oldest#tab-top">this question</a> which helped me out. I thought the accepted answer was easier to understand and that's the method I would prefer. </p>
<p>However, it looks like the answer which utilizes the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>glob</code></a> module is considerably more popular. What are the possible reasons for this? Is there an advantage that this method has over the accepted answer?</p>

<p>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one obvious way to find all path names that match a pattern is the glob module, since that is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow">what it is documented to do</a>.</p>
<p>The accepted answer implements a subset of glob's functionality, it can find all files ending in <code>.txt</code>. It is not wrong, but it is not the One Way.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I would have posted a comment on the answer but 1. I don't have the reputation required and 2. It seemed more like a question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The asker appears to have had some issues getting <code>glob</code> to work, so did not accept it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I see that, but I guess I was trying to point out the difference in upvotes received by the two answers as an indicator of the more popular answer.</span>
