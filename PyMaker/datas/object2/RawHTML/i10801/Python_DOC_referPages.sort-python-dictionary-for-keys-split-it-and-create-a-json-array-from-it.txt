<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have this huge JSON file, which contains more than 80000 lines, looking like that:</p>
<pre><code>{u'hero_name': u'bristleback', u'gold_total': 17937, tick:24098}
{u'hero_name': u'silencer', u'gold_total': 10847, tick:24198}
{u'hero_name': u'silencer', u'gold_total': 11789, tick:25098}
{u'hero_name': u'weaver', u'gold_total': 27084, tick:27098}
</code></pre>
<p>There are 10 different heroes with their gold data. I want to sort that data for the hero names, make a json list of the gold data, and then store it in a databse table looking like that, where gold_data should be like [{tick, gold}, {tick, gold}, ...]</p>
<pre><code>id |Â hero_name | gold_data (json field) | ... 
</code></pre>
<p>But seems like i am too stupid to sort that. I tried building a list out of it and using <code>sorted(gold_list, key=lambda s: s[0])</code> </p>
<p>I am just not too comfortable with Python yet and I tried so many different things, but i have no idea how to sort,and then split this dictionary for the hero_names key so I can get that JSON object for gold_data</p>

<p>You need to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">json</a> - there are other packages, but this one should do it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Load the JSON to a veriable using <code>open()</code></li>
<li>Convert to <code>dict</code> using <code>json.loads()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>import json
from pprint import pprint

with open('data.json') as data_file:    
    data = json.load(data_file)

dct = json.loads(data)
pprint(dct)
</code></pre>
<p>You CANNOT sort the dictionary though - you will have to convert the <code>dict</code> to <strong>array of tuples</strong> - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/613183/sort-a-python-dictionary-by-value">please, refer here</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19110407/converting-json-objects-in-to-dictionary-in-python">here</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2835559/parsing-values-from-a-json-file-in-python">here</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well i am receiving Json, convert it to a dict so i can work with it and then convert it back to json.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That didn't answer my question. Python has built-in functionality for handling JSON, as linked above, so please look into it and make an effort to use it. Then, if you're still stuck, you'll have an actual <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>. And please don't put noise like thank yous in your posts; I edited it out for a reason.</span>
