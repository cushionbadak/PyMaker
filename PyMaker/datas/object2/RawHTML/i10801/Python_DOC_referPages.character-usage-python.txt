<p>I am trying to find out how to use characters in python (!,@,$ etc), however i haven't been able to find anything to give any help or any detail about this.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; $
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>What i'm  looking for is why this is happen and an example of syntax. Or wether this simply does nothing and isn't a feature and python however if it wasn't I would assume you could use the character as a variable however you cannot.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; $ = 'Example'
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Naming convention rules in python only allow numbers, letters, and underscores. Here specifically are the rules</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Variables names must start with a letter or an underscore, such as:
    _underscore
    underscore_
The remainder of your variable name may consist of letters, numbers and underscores.
    password1
    n00b
    un_der_scores
Names are case sensitive.
    case_sensitive, CASE_SENSITIVE, and Case_Sensitive are each a different variable.
</code></pre>

<p>Generally, Python identifiers can only use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="nofollow">letters (from various languages), numbers, or underscores</a>.  Unlike JavaScript, <code>$</code> isn't a valid identifier character.  Likewise, most punctuation, including <code>!</code> and <code>@</code>, is not allowed in identifiers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>valid characters for identifiers [in Python] are the uppercase and lowercase letters <code>A</code> through <code>Z</code>, the underscore <code>_</code> and, except for the first character, the digits <code>0</code> through <code>9</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, a valid assignment might look like</p>
<pre><code>spam = 'Example'
</code></pre>
<p>for the identifier <code>spam</code>.</p>
