<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>class SpreadsheetRow(object):
def __init__(self,Account1):
    self.Account1=Account1
    self.Account2=0
</code></pre>
<p>I have a while loop that fills a list of objects ,and another loop that fills a dictionary associating Var1:Account2. But, I need to get that dictionary's value into each object, if the key matches the object's Account1.</p>
<p>So basically, I have:</p>
<pre><code>listofSpreadsheetRowObjects=[SpreadsheetRow1, SpreadsheetRow2, SpreadsheetRow3]
dict_var1_to_account2={1234:888, 1991:646, 90802:5443}
</code></pre>
<p>I've tried this:</p>
<pre><code>for k, v in dict_var1_to_account2.iteritems():
    if k in listOfSpreadsheetRowObjects:
        if self.account1=k:
              self.account2=v
</code></pre>
<p>But, it's not working, and I suspect it's my first "if" statement, because listOfSpreadsheetRowObjects is just a list of those objects. How would I access account1 of each object, so I can match them as needed? </p>
<p>Eventually, I should have three objects with the following information:
SpreadsheetRow
self.Account1=Account1
self.Account2=(v from my dictionary, if account1 matches the key in my dictionary)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use a generator expression within <code>any()</code> to check if any <code>account1</code> attribute of those objects is equal with <code>k</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if any(k == item.account1 for item in listOfSpreadsheetRows):
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow"><code>next</code></a> function like this:</p>
<pre><code>next(i for i in listOfSpreadsheetRows if k == i.account1)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you have a dictionary <code>d</code> and want to get the value associated to the key <code>x</code> then you look up that value like this:</p>
<pre><code>v = d[x]
</code></pre>
<p>So if your dictionary is called <code>dict_of_account1_to_account2</code> and the key is <code>self.Account1</code> and you want to set that value to <code>self.Account2</code> then you would do:</p>
<pre><code>self.Account2 = dict_of_account1_to_account2[self.Account1]
</code></pre>
<p>The whole point of using a dictionary is that you don't have to iterate through the entire thing to look things up.</p>
<p>Otherwise if you are doing this initialization of <code>.Account2</code> after creating all the <code>SpreadsheetRow</code> objects then using <code>self</code> doesn't make sense, you would need to iterate through each <code>SpreadsheetRow</code> item and do the assignment for each one, something like this:</p>
<pre><code>for row in listofSpreadsheetRowObjects:
    for k, v in dict_of_account1_to_account2.iteritems():
        if row.Account1 == k:
            row.Account2 = v
</code></pre>
<p>But again, you don't have to iterate over the dictionary to make the assignment, just look up <code>row.Account1</code> from the dict:</p>
<pre><code>for row in listofSpreadsheetRowObjects:
    row.Account2 = dict_of_account1_to_account2[row.Account1]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to clarify what your variables are, what is <code>Account1value</code>? Should it be <code>Account1</code> from the argument? And what are <code>SpreadsheetRow1</code>, <code>SpreadsheetRow2</code> etc? Are they instances of <code>SpreadsheetRow</code>, usually names starting with a capital are classes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Edited to hopefully make it more clear</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well since it is a dictionary I'd expect <code>self.Account2 = dict_of_account1_to_account2[self.Account1]</code> but I don't understand where you are putting that code, why is it checking <code>if k in listOfSpreadsheetRowObjects:</code> that would never come true...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Account2 doesn't equal account1. Account2 needs to equal the value of the account1 key if they match.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and I think if k in listOfSpreadsheetRowObjects is my problem, I'm trying to find out if k is in the object in the sheet.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"if any(k = item.account1 for item in listOfSpreadsheetRows): "  k== item.account1</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@galaxyan Yep, thanks for comment ;-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Edit: I WAS. Got it figured out, thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">for row in listofSpreadsheetRowObjects:         row.Account2 = dict_of_account1_to_account2[row.Account1] gives me a KeyError....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, so I think what was confusing was my variable names. I've changed them to hopefully show what it is I'm doing.</span>
