<p>I am BRAND new to python because my new school requires it. I am used to c++ so I'm still learning the ropes. I'm trying to make a dice rolling simulator and I thought i was doing everything right but my code just won't work. Any tips or guides to help me learn would be greatly appreciated. Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>import random

def roll(sides=6):
    num_rolled = random.randint(l,sides)
    return num_rolled

def main():
    sides = 6
    rolling = True
    while rolling:
        roll_again = input("Ready to roll? ENTER=Roll. Q=Quit. ")
    if roll_again.lower() != "q":
        num_rolled = roll(sides)
        print("You rolled a", num_rolled)
    else:
        rolling = False

    print("Thanks for playing!")

main()
</code></pre>
<p>This is the error I get: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Users\nomor\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\DiceRollingSim.py", line 20, in  main() File "C:\Users\nomor\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\DiceRollingSim.py", line 13, in main num_rolled = roll(sides) File "C:\Users\nomor\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\DiceRollingSim.py", line 4, in roll num_rolled = random.randint(l,sides) NameError: name 'l' is not defined</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For the first issue...</p>
<pre><code>num_rolled = random.randint(l,sides)
</code></pre>
<p><code>l != 1</code>. You put an "l" instead of the number 1. Python thinks this is a variable which you haven't defined anywhere -&gt; the error you get.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> randint takes two ints as parameters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>random.randint(a, b)
  Return a random integer N such that a &lt;= N &lt;= b. Alias for randrange(a, b+1).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, look at these lines in your code.</p>
<pre><code> while rolling:
    roll_again = input("Ready to roll? ENTER=Roll. Q=Quit. ")
 if roll_again.lower() != "q":
    num_rolled = roll(sides)
    print("You rolled a", num_rolled)
 else:
    rolling = False
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>if-else</code> part needs to be indented inside of the while loop:</p>
<pre><code>while rolling:
    roll_again = input("Ready to roll? ENTER=Roll. Q=Quit. ")
    if roll_again.lower() != "q":
        num_rolled = roll(sides)
        print("You rolled a", num_rolled)
    else:
        rolling = False
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much. Rookie mistake huh? This actually helped a lot.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem, glad I could help! We've all made rookie mistakes at some point :D</span>
