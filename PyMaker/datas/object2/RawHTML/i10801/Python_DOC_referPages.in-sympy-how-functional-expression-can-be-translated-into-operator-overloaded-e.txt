<p>Recently I am working with boolean network and I am using sympy to manipulate boolean functions. I think this can be very basic question but I could not find any clue.</p>
<p>Following line works well. </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;from sympy import *
&gt;&gt;&gt;x,y = symbols("x y")
&gt;&gt;&gt;(x | y) &amp; x
And(Or(x, y), x)
</code></pre>
<p>Here I have very simple question. How the expression 'And(Or(x, y), x)' can be expressed as '(x | y) &amp; x'? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Sympy makes extensive use of Python operator overloading capabilities.
In Python each class can define as any mathematical operator will take effect, by defining methods with special names - these methods allways are prefixed and postfixed  with <code>__</code>, and are described in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html" rel="nofollow">Python Data Model</a>.</p>
<p>Sympy symbols and expressions are objects that redefine all of the operator-related methods to perform an operation that return a Sympy expression object instead of a numeric result.</p>
<p>Thus, the operators for  bynary and <code>&amp;</code> an dbinary or <code>|</code> are just one part of what Sympy does, and the long English versions <code>And</code> and <code>Or</code> function calls are provided as well for ease of typing and readability in certain contexts.</p>

<p>If you just want nicer printing, you can run </p>
<pre><code>init_printing()
</code></pre>
<p>and it will print it using Unicode characters, or even LaTeX if it's available (like in the Jupyter notebook)</p>
<pre><code>In [1]: (x | y) &amp; x
Out[1]: x ∧ (x ∨ y)
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the <code>pprint()</code> function to get this directly. </p>
<p>It looks like the default SymPy printers use <code>And</code> and <code>Or</code> instead of the <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code> symbols to print logic expressions, so if you explicitly want those, you would need to subclass <code>sympy.printing.str.StrPrinter</code> and override <code>_print_And</code> and <code>_print_Or</code> (see the <a href="https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/17d046e8386fb4098d442b04f4b7bcf8a798f5b9/sympy/printing/str.py#L77" rel="nofollow">current implementation</a> to get an idea of how that would work). </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for kind detailed reply. Is there any simple function to translate string variable 'And(Or(x, y), x)' into string variable '(x | y) &amp; x'? If the solution is not simple, then can you give some hint for doing that?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I found it a good solution for my problem. Thanks for the good hint.</span>
