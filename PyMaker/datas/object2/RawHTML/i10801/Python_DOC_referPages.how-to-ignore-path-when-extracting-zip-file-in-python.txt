<p>I want to ignore the path of a file stored in a zip. 
I use the following:</p>
<pre><code>ZipFile.extract('/ignorepath/filename.txt', '/mygoodpath')
</code></pre>
<p>This will create the followng:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/mygoodpath/ignorepath/filename.txt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would prefer </p>
<blockquote>
<p>/mygoodpath/filename.txt</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am looking at shutil.move as well as ZipFile.open to open and write, though the later would probably have a few edge cases. Best method to handle this?</p>

<p>Try using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.open" rel="nofollow">Zipfile.open</a></p>
<pre><code>with ZipFile('spam.zip') as myzip:
    with myzip.open('/ignorepath/filename.txt') as infile:
        with open('/mygoodpath/filename.txt', 'w') as outfile:
            outfile.write(infile.read())
