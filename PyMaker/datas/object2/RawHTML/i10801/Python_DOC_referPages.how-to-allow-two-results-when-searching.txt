<p>I am making a dictionary/translator but I want to let the user write, 'hello' and 'Hello' and still receive the result 'Ronne'.</p>
<pre><code>print ("English to Exrian Dictionary")
search = input("Enter the word you would like to translate: ")

if search == "Hello":
    print ("Ronne")
elif search == "Bye":
    print ("Zio")
else:
    print ("No matches were found for '" + search + "'")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To ignore the case, just convert your search to lowercase</p>
<pre><code>search = search.lower()
if search == "hello":
    print ("Ronne")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could just convert your input to lowercase, and compare to "hello", like this:</p>
<pre><code>search = input("Enter the word you would like to translate: ").lower()

if search == "hello":
    print("Ronne")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">For the sake of completeness, in addition to the <code>.lower()</code> approach, you could also do something like <code>if search in ['Hello','hello']:</code> -- in this case, it seems less-clear approach than using <code>.lower()</code>, but it is still an option to be aware of.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using <code>if...elif...</code> is ok for a couple of words, but if you want to handle a larger number of words you should use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dictionary</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i want it to allow the user to write "Hello" or "hello" to get the same answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MichaelThin that's exactly what this will do. Just try it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">but i want the users input. like this. search = input("example:").lower()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i tried that it dont work. do i need to add input part?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, yes this code comes after the line <code>search = input(...)</code>. If you use <code>search = input(...).lower()</code>, you already converted it to lowercase, no need to do it again.</span>
