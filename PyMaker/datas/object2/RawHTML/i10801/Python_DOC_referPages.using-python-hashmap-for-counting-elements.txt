<p>When i need to count elements of different type , i find myself writing something like:</p>
<pre><code>if k not in removed:
    removed[k] = 0
removed[k] = removed[k] + 1
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes i do the same thing with a new empty list that will grow over time.
The above code works fine, but it feels like there is a better way of writing it.
Is there?</p>

<p>In addition to defaultdict/Counter mentioned in comments, you can also have a default value returned from a failed <code>get</code>. This allows you to set the initial count to 0 if the key lookup fails and immediately increment by 1, or increment by 1 each time the key is found as you loop through.</p>
<pre><code>vehicles = ['car', 'bike', 'truck', 'car', 'truck', 'truck']

my_dict = {}
for k in vehicles:
    my_dict[k] = my_dict.get(k, 0) + 1 
</code></pre>

<p>One way to do it:</p>
<pre><code>countdict = dict()
for k in inputlist:
    if k not in countdict.keys():
        countdict[k] = inputlist.count(k)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is exactly what the <code>Counter</code> is for!

<span class="comment-copy">This sounds like a job for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Counter</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can make that slightly neater by using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict" rel="nofollow noreferrer">defauldict</a> instead of a plain dict. There's also a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Counter</a> class, which has some powerful methods, but it runs a little slower, so if speed's an issue use defaultdict, unless you want to use those Counter methods.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks guys that Counters and defaultdict is what i'm looking for. Next time i'l use codereview (:</span>
