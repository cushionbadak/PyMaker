<p>I am completely confused about the use of annotation in python...</p>
<p>In python documentation it says that Function annotations are completely optional metadata information....you can refer to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html</a></p>
<p>and if it is completely optional then why are we having this in python?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/#fundamentals-of-function-annotations" rel="nofollow">PEP 3107</a> related to these annotations, you can read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only way that annotations take on meaning is when they are interpreted by third-party libraries. These annotation consumers can do anything they want with a function's annotations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use it for documentation purposes, linting, validation... But nothing in the standard library use it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Functions annotations can be truly great when using a library, it helps you knowing the type of the parameters you need to send without having to crawl into tons of documentation sheets.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">actually the answer for annotations provided on stackoverflow are for java...I want the answer for python...please provide some examples and their respective explanations.....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Out of the three links that I gave you, only one even <i>mentions</i> Java.  They are all three about Python.</span>
