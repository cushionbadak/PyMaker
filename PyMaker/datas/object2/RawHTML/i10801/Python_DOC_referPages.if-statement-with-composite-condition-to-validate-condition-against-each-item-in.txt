<p>I found a similar question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8600567/if-statement-against-each-item-in-a-list">here</a> but the answers don't seem to apply to my issue.</p>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>y = 3
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]

if y != 0 or y != list1:
    print("y is not in range")
else:
    print(y)
</code></pre>
<p>It keeps printing <code>y is not in range</code>.</p>
<p>My goal is to check if <code>y</code> does <strong>not</strong> equal to <code>0</code> <strong>or</strong> if <code>y</code> does not equal to any item in the list.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I understand that the above <code>or</code> should be an <code>and</code>, I'm specifically interested in how to check in the condition of <code>y</code> being contained in the list. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You want to check that <code>y</code> is different from <code>0</code> <strong>AND</strong> not in the list:</p>
<pre><code>if y != 0 and y not in list1:
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>or</code> means that <em>one</em> of the conditions is sufficient, so since <code>y != 0</code> it returns <code>True</code> without going to <code>y != list1</code> which would always return <code>False</code> because an <code>int</code> is not a <code>list</code>, you have to use <code>in</code> in that case.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you really want to use an <code>or</code> then you what you want:</p>
<pre><code>if not (y == 0 or y in list1):
    print('y not in range')
else:
    print(y)
</code></pre>
<p>Rememer the De Morgan laws:</p>
<pre><code>not (y == 0 or y in list1) == (not y == 0) and (not y in list1) == y != 0 and y not in list1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Regarding the question asked in the title, you can write something like</p>
<pre><code>true if condition else false for y in list1
</code></pre>
<p>to check <code>condition</code> for every element <code>y</code> in the list <code>list1</code>.
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/394809/does-python-have-a-ternary-conditional-operator">HERE</a> a useful link.</p>
<p>Otherwise @Bakuriu response is correct.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you understand looping? Look up <code>for</code> loops. And this always prints that line because <code>y != list1</code> will always be true. A list will never be equal to a number.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this is the right answer for this particular problem, the title of the question suggests a slightly different question than the one in the body.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Carcigenicate So edit the title? Titles and questions frequently mismatch and I have never seen any suggestion that we should ignore the question and answer the title instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Carcigenicate The title should be a summary of the question. The question <i>is the body</i>. If the don't match the title should be edited to match the body. I'll later edit the question to make it clearer and try to find a better title.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bakuriu, while your answer is right, I believe the portion for <code>TypeError</code> may be incorrect for this instance. As it only applies to <code>&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">comparisons</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CoryShay Yeah, you are right. I was thinking of <code>&lt;</code> and then forgot about it. Fixed.</span>
