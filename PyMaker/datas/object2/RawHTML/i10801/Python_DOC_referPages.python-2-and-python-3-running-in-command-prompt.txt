<p>Having various projects in both Python 2 and Python 3 (with both python versions installed), I was looking for a more intuitive way to run scripts via Command Prompt than
<code>py -3 script.py</code>.</p>
<p>Python 2 already took <code>python script.py</code>, so ideally <code>python3 script.py</code> should invoke Python 3.</p>
<p>My question: How can I add <code>python3</code> as a Command Prompt command?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Searching did not yield good results, so I thought I should share the process I took with anyone looking for this in the future.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the Python 3 folder is present in the PATH environment variable. </li>
<li>Locate the "python.exe" file in the Python 3 folder.</li>
<li>Copy and Paste the "python.exe" file within the Python 3 folder.</li>
<li>Rename the copied file to "python3" (or whatever you want the command to be).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, when you input <code>python3 script.py</code> to Command Prompt, the script will run through the copied Python 3 file.</p>
<p>Also, by copying python.exe (instead of renaming it) you allow other interpreters - such as PyCharm - to continue using their default "python.exe" path settings.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>A "symlink" has the same effect, but keeps things a bit tidier.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If Python 2 and 3 are both installed and in the PATH variable, you can do:</p>
<p>py -2</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>py -3</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Most operating systems do this (<code>python</code>/<code>python3</code>) by default.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Rather than copying the <code>python</code> executable simply create a <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">symlink</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm fairly certain after some searching, I could find this exact solution elsewhere, but glad you solved it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ahh! This is not a good solution at all!  I'm glad it worked but (a) properly configuring your <code>%PATH%</code>, and (b) using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python Launcher</a> should be all that you need.  If for some reason it's not, then dimo414's suggestion of a symlink is much better.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The reason you want a symlink is that a "python3.exe" symlink will still be valid if "python.exe" gets replaced by an in-place upgrade. You don't have to remember to copy the file again. Just run <code>mklink python3.exe python.exe</code> in an administrator command prompt.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah! I had never heard of a symlinks before! Thank you for this information.</span>
