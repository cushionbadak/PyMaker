<p>So... I have this primitive calculator that runs fine on my cellphone, but when I try to run it on Windows 10 I get...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ValueError: could not convert string to float</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know what the problem is, I've tried using <code>raw_input</code> but it doesn't work ether. Please keep in mind I'm green and am not aware of most methods for getting around a problem like this</p>
<pre><code>num1 = float(input ()) #take a float and store it
chars = input () #take a string          and store it
num2 = float(input ())
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>your code only convert string that are integers like in below statement</p>
<pre><code>num1 = float(input ()) #take a float and store it ex 13
print num1 # output 13.0
</code></pre>
<p>if you provide <code>13</code> as a input it will give the output as <code>13.0</code>
but if you provide <code>SOMEONEE</code> as input it will give <code>ValueError</code></p>
<p>And it is same with the case of <code>raw_input()</code> but the difference is that by default <code>raw_input()</code> takes input as a string and <code>input()</code> takes input as what is provided to the function</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think this is happening because in some cases 'input' contains non-numerical characters. Python is smart and when a string only contains numbers, it can be converted from string to float. When the string contains non-numerical characters, it is not possible for Python to convert it to a float.</p>
<p>You could fix this a few ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find out why and when there are non-numerical characters in your input and then fix it.</li>
<li>Check if input contains numbers only with: <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_isdecimal.htm" rel="nofollow">isdecimal()</a></li>
<li>Use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow">try/except</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>isdecimal() example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>my_input = raw_input()
if my_input.isdecimal():
    print("Ok, go ahead its all numbers")
</code></pre>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
Two-Bit-Alchemist had some great advice in the comments, so I put it in my answer.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you should not have characters in your <code>input</code> and don't use <code>input</code> use <code>raw_input</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't intend to input characters. My code does not allow me to input even a float it simply reads the line, skips it and gives me a ValueError . I'll post the whole program once I get on my laptop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please include what inputs are failing. (What examples you're trying, if "everything".)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Give me a few minutes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm trying to send the whole program but it does not fit into the comments section.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am aware that inputting strings gives a ValueError. My program does not even allow me to input onto the variable, it simply skips that command. BUT I have the exact same code running a calculator on my phone and it works but it won't work on my desktop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please edit the question and explain in brief what you want?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">The <code>isdigit</code> method is less than great here because (1.) anything with a decimal point will fail this test (alternative: <code>isdecimal</code>) and (2.) the OP needs numbers to calculate with later so may as well go ahead and cast, being prepared to catch <code>ValueError</code> (your option 3).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Two-BitAlchemist thanks for the pointers! I edited my answer :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your heading still says "isdigit" example. I tried to fix it but your latest edit you accidentally rolled it back ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">FIXED! :) Thanks again</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Anything with a decimal point will also fail <code>isdecimal()</code>. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22789392/">The difference between <code>isdigit</code> and <code>isdecimal</code></a> is apparently just some unicode characters.</span>
