<p>In my program I call the command:</p>
<pre><code>command_two = 'sfit4Layer0.py -bv5 -fs'
subprocess.call(command_two.split(), shell=False)

<p>I am using PyCharm and I get the error message:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>When walking through my program, it never gets to the program I want it to sfit4Layer0.py, it is getting stuck in subprocess but I am not sure why. Changing the shell=True doesn't do anything helpful either - I don't get these error messages but it does not execute my code properly. Any suggestions would be helpful. </p>
<p>My bash profile:</p>
<pre><code>PATH="~/bin:/usr/bin:${PATH}"

export PATH PYTHONPATH="/Users/nataliekille/Documents/sfit4/pbin/Layer0:/Users/nataliekille/Documents/sfit4/pbin/Layer1:/Users/nataliekille/Documents/sfit4/pbin/ModLib:/Users/nataliekille/Documents/sfit4/SpectralDB"

export PYTHONPATH

PATH=${PATH}:${PYTHONPATH}

export PATH

<p>You've missed <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#frequently-used-arguments" rel="nofollow">an important part of the <code>subprocess</code> documentation</a>. "If passing a single string <em>[at the command, rather than a list of strings]</em>, either shell must be True (see below) or else the string must simply name the program to be executed without specifying any arguments."</p>
<p>So the kernel is compaining because there is not executable with the name <code>'sfit4Layer0.py -bv5 -fs'</code>. Should work if you replace the string with (for example) <code>'sfit4Layer0.py -bv5 -fs'.split()</code>, or <code>['sfit4Layer0.py', '-bv5',  '-fs']</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is the script in a directory that is in <code>$PATH</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">which script are you talking about exactly? I am trying to edit my bash profile now and it is being finnicky. how would you suggest I write the directory into $PATH ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Let's say the script resides in <code>/home/user/Layer0</code>, in your <code>.bash_profile</code> do: <code>PATH=/home/user/Layer0:$PATH</code> (there is no need for the { }, although they don't do any harm).  Note I have used the full hierarchic name.  Then, on the command-line, "source" the file" <code>. ./.bash_profile</code>, then run your python program or PyCharm.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so sfit4Layer0.py is in Layer0 and if you look at my above bash profile, it is in there..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK.  In that case, does the script work from the command-line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I do use split when I call it, which should make it a list, right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, it should - sorry, I missed that (you didn't edit the question, right?). Yes, that will make it a list. Have you checked that a) <code>sfit4Layer0.py</code> exists on your system <code>$PATH</code>? b) Its executable bit(s) is/are set correctly? and c) That it has a "shebang" line such as <code>#!/usr/bin/env python</code> so the kernel knows which program to process it with?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added my bashprofile along. the program is in the Layer0 directory so shouldn't that suffice?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not necessarily. Try a simpler call like <code>subprocess.call('sfit4Layer0.py')</code>. If that doesn't work (<i>i.e.</i> if it still can't run the program) then the issue is that either the <code>.py</code> file isn't executable or  it isn't on the search path.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what do you mean by "isn't on the search path"? It is confusing because if I run it separately (by making the subprocess.call its own program) or type the command into the terminal it works perfectly - it just won't execute in this code. Also when I did what you suggested above, it simply output "command not found"</span>
