<p>I have an empty table in SQL management studio that I’d like to populate with values for each sentence. The table has 3 columns – SentId, Word, Count.</p>
<p>My sentence has this structure:</p>
<pre><code>sentence = {‘features’: [{}, {}, {}…] , ‘id’: 1234}
</code></pre>
<p>--&gt;To fill out SentId values, I call SQL “insert into table values (provide 3 values for 3 columns here)” statement, entering sentence[‘id’], which returns 1234. That’s simple. With a next step I have problems.</p>
<p>--&gt;To get values for Word and Count columns, I need to get inside ‘features’ which has this structure:</p>
<pre><code>‘features’: [ {‘word’:’ hello’, ‘count’: 2}, {‘word’: ’there’, ‘count’:1}, {}, {}…]
</code></pre>
<p>I ran this so far:</p>
<pre><code>sentence = {'features': [{'word': 'hello', 'count': 2}, {'word': 'there', 'count':1}] , 'id': 1234}
print(sentence['features'])
    #out&gt;&gt;  [{'word': 'hello', 'count': 2}, {'word': 'there', 'count': 1}]
</code></pre>
<p>So I need to get inside the dictionary that is within a list.
This didn`t work:</p>
<pre><code>print(sentence['features'].get("word"))
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks so much for helping me out. I am new to programming.</p>

<p>As you can maybe see for yourself, sentence['features'] returns a list. Not a dictionary.
In order to get an element from a list in Python, you need to index it.</p>
<pre><code>a=[1,2,3]
print(a[0]) #would print 1
</code></pre>
<p>So in your case, that would lead to the following code:</p>
<pre><code>print(sentence['features'][0].get("word"))
</code></pre>
<p>sentence['features'][0] returns the first dictionary, in which you then return the value for the key 'word'.
If you want to loop over all the items in the list you can do:</p>
<pre><code>for i in sentence['features']:
    print(i['word'])
</code></pre>
