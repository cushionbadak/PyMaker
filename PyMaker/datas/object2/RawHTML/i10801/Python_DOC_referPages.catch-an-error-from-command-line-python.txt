<p>I need to catch an error from command line without print error message on the screen. When this occurs I need to give another command to run.</p>
<p>This is what I do now:</p>
<pre><code>hyst_cmd = "si viewhistory ..."
process = subprocess.Popen(hyst_cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
hyst = process.stdout.read().splitlines()
</code></pre>
<p>When I do this for some projects I receive an error message, on the screen.</p>
<p>Sorry for my english!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>According to the official document, the most common exception for Popen in subprocess is <strong>OSError</strong>.</p>
<p>To catch the error, you can simply try the following approach:</p>
<pre><code>hyst_cmd = "si viewhistory ..."

try:
    process = subprocess.Popen(hyst_cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
    hyst = process.stdout.read().splitlines()

except OSError:
    &lt;write_log_file or other action.&gt;
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried putting this code in <code>try-except</code> block?? that is a good way to catch the exceptions and you can specify another "command" that you want to run in the <code>except</code> block.</span>
