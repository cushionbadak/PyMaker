<p>I want to log <strong>everything:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Function entered + values of parameters + function exited</li>
<li>Result of every assignment or operation</li>
<li>etc.</li>

<p>Is it possible to log "everything" in a Python execution without instrumenting the code?</p>
<p>Since things are executing in a VM, it should be possible to configure this at the VM level (hopefully?).</p>
<p>I'm using Pycharm but I could do it via commandline it it's necessary.</p>
<p>There's this existing question: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23435488/how-to-do-logging-at-function-entry-inside-and-exit-in-python">How to do logging at function entry, inside and exit in Python</a> but it doesn't address how to log the result of variable assignments.</p>

<p>You would need to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html" rel="nofollow"><code>trace</code></a> module and/or perhaps the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow"><code>pdb</code></a> module. They may not give you everything you need, but it would be a starting point. The <code>logging</code> module doesn't work at such a low level as you seem to want.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">whoever voted to close: could you at least tell me WHY it's a bad question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't look like it keeps track of variables.</span>
