<p>I have the below regex (from this link: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10380992/get-python-dictionary-from-string-containing-key-value-pairs">get python dictionary from string containing key value pairs</a>)</p>
<pre><code>r"\b(\w+)\s*:\s*([^:]*)(?=\s+\w+\s*:|$)"
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the explanation:</p>
<pre><code>\b           # Start at a word boundary
(\w+)        # Match and capture a single word (1+ alnum characters)
\s*:\s*      # Match a colon, optionally surrounded by whitespace
([^:]*)      # Match any number of non-colon characters
(?=          # Make sure that we stop when the following can be matched:
 \s+\w+\s*:  #  the next dictionary key
|            # or
 $           #  the end of the string
)            # End of lookahead
</code></pre>
<p>My question is that when my string has the word with the "-" in between, for example: <code>movie-night</code>, the above regex is not working and I think it is due to the <code>b(\w+)</code>. How can I change this regex to work with word including the "-"? I have tried <code>b(\w+-)</code> but it does not work. Thanks for your help in advance. </p>

<p>You could try something such as this:</p>
<pre><code>r"\b([\w\-]+)\s*:\s*([^:]*)(?=\s+\w+\s*:|$)"
</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>[\w\-]+</code>, which allows matching both a word character and a dash.</p>
<p>For readability in the future, you may also want to investigate <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.X" rel="nofollow"><code>re.X/re.VERBOSE</code></a>, which can make regex more readable.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You may try 'b([\w-]+)'.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where is the colon in your example? Your regex seems to require one, no?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Best to escape the hyphen in case of future additions: <code>[\w\-]+</code></span>
