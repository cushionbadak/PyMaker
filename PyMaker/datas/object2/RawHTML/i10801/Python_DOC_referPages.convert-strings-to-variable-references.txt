<p>I have a list of strings:</p>
<pre><code>A = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to have a list B of variable references:</p>
<pre><code>B = [a, b, c, d]
</code></pre>
<p>How can I do that?</p>
<p><strong>Edit1:</strong></p>
<p>I have </p>
<pre><code>df_wgt_dict["Freq"+vars_dict['varName'+str(I)]]
</code></pre>
<p>here I ranges from 1 to 4.</p>
<p>I want to have a list like below:</p>
<pre><code>[df_wgt_dict["Freq"+vars_dict['varName'+str(1)],df_wgt_dict["Freq"+vars_dict['varName'+str(2)],df_wgt_dict["Freq"+vars_dict['varName'+str(3)],df_wgt_dict["Freq"+vars_dict['varName'+str(4)]]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>A = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
B = []
for s in A:
    temp_storage = exec('%s = %d' % (s, my_value))
    B.append(temp_storage)
</code></pre>
<p>This will change your list A in list B with variables instead of strings</p>

<p>You can't do this directly. However, if you want to perform some operation with these variables, you can still use the keyword <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>exec</code></a> or the function <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>eval</code></a>. These are two different things, that produce different results, but here you can use on or the other without problems.</p>
<p>For example, this will print <code>5</code></p>
<pre><code>a = 5
exec 'print a'
</code></pre>
<p>A simple trick to do what you want:</p>
<pre><code>a = 5
b = 6
c = 2
d = 3

L = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']  # the input list

M = list()  # the result list
for e in L:
    exec 'M.append('+e+')'  # or eval('M.append('+e+')')
print M
</code></pre>
<p>This will print</p>
<pre><code>[5, 6, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NB : This will not create a list of variables references, but a list of the values of your variables at the moment you call this. You'll have to call it again if you want updated values.</strong></p>

<span class="comment-copy">It is not exactly clear what you mean.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean you want to print it out as such a list? If you simply want a list of characters it is impossible. Don't even know a use case where this would be needed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Lists contains values, not variables. "Variable" is just a name that points to some value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you do <code>print(A)</code> you get the representation of the list which is normally used for debug purposes. If you want a special output you have to write it yourself (like <code>print('[{}]'.format(','.join(A)))</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you trying to do that? Where does <code>A</code> come from?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't recommend <code>exec</code> unless you know <i>why</i> the question is asked in the first place.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do people start to link to Docs.SO? Especially Python comes with a great documentaion.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In my case,each of the elements in list is dataframe.I am passing this to some optimization function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@FullName Docs has good examples, that can be more understandable than official doc for beginners. I'll leave a link for both of them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why is this answer getting downvoted?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@marupav <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, etc. can be of any type. You can do lists of every possible types. I just chose ints so it's easier to understand</span>
