<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to fully capitalise a word as well as include its length in a new list, using list comprehension.</p>
<p>For example if I entered <code>wordLengths(["hello","bye","greetings"])</code> I am wanting this output.</p>
<pre><code>[("HELLO",5),("BYE",3),("GREETINGS",9)] 
</code></pre>
<p>This is my current code</p>
<pre><code>def wordLengths(myWords):
    return [i.upper() for i in myWords], [len(i) for i in myWords]
</code></pre>
<p>And this is the current output</p>
<pre><code>(['HELLO', 'BYE', 'GREETINGS'], [5, 3, 9])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to do the both in one list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>[(i.upper(), len(i)) for i in myWords]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your method is returning a tuple of two lists, and what you are actually trying to do is create a list of tuples.</p>
<p>Your comprehension would simply be: </p>
<pre><code>[(word.upper(), len(word)) for word in words]
</code></pre>
<p>So, your method can now be re-written as: </p>
<pre><code>def wordLengths(myWords):
    return [(word.upper(), len(word)) for word in myWords]
</code></pre>
<p>Demo: </p>
<pre><code>words = ["hello", "bye", "greetings"]
print(wordLengths(words))
# outputs
# [('HELLO', 5), ('BYE', 3), ('GREETINGS', 9)] 
</code></pre>
</div>

Anyway, you can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zip</a> your return statement, i.e. <code>return zip( [i.upper() for i in myWords], [len(i) for i in myWords] )</code>, or do any of the suggestions below.</span>
