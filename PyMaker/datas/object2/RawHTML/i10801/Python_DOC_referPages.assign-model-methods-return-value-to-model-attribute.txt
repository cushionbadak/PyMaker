<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a class similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>class X(models.Model):
  def hello(self):
    return "Humpty Dumpty"

  name = (hello,)
  age = models.IntegerField()
</code></pre>
<p>now when I run in the console: <code>y.name</code> being <code>y</code> an instance, I get the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(property object at 0x0000000004FDCBD8,)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What am I doing wrong here?</p>
<p>I tried using the <code>@property</code> above the method but it didn't work.</p>
<p>I'd like to get "Humpty Dumpty" when I access <code>y.name</code>. So the method would assign it's value to the attribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you just want to get the function called on attribute access, define name as property and provide your function <code>foo</code> to it:</p>
<pre><code>name = property(hello)
</code></pre>
<p>This will set the <code>fget</code> inside the property to your function <code>hello</code>. </p>
<pre><code>y = X()
y.name
'Humpty Dumpty'
</code></pre>
<p>Take note, there's a pretty good <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html" rel="nofollow">tutorial on descriptors</a> in the Python Official docs.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That's invalid syntax. You need to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>class X:
  def __init__(self):
      self.name = self.hello()

  def hello(self):
    return "Humpty Dumpty"

test = X()
print(test.name) # prints "Humpty Dumpty"
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You haven't said what you want that assignment to do. Also, I can't reproduce the "property object" value you see printed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NedBatchelder my bad.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, mate. I couldn't find precise documentation on this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you also tell how to use a method inside another?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not exactly sure what you mean by that, call a method inside another method?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes. Exactly that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just call it, you get <code>self</code> passed in every method implicitly so just use <code>self.method_name()</code> to call it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is this in django? I added the python tag because I think it might be something more specific to python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, this is general python code.</span>
