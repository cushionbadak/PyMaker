<p>Currently I am using <a href="https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial" rel="nofollow"><em>pySerial</em></a> and its <code>list_ports.comports()</code> function to poll for changes of the currently available serial ports of devices with a certain vid/pid. I'd like to know if there is a way to avoid polling and get notified of a port change instead?</p>

<p>Probably you have to deal with some of C/C++ code, integrated with Python: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html</a>. I'm afraid, such low-level functions are almost impossible in hi-level programming language like Python.

<span class="comment-copy">It might be pretty heavy but maybe delve into the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html#module-asyncio" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>asyncio</code></a> module - no experience myself with it but skimming over it looks like it can solve many <i>problems</i>.</span>
