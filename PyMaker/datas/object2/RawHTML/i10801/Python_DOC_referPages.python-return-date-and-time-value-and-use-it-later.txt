<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have the following code, but I'm not quite sure how it's going to work.</p>
<p>I'll execute the following:</p>
<pre><code>date = strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
</code></pre>
<p>and it will return exact date and time of the moment I call this. I want to use the exact output of this date and time in another function which is going to be execute 2-3 seconds later.</p>
<p>How can I pass the date variable here and not use the new current time and date?</p>

<p>Does anything stop you from passing <code>date</code> as a parameter to your other function ? </p>

<p>If you can't pass it as a parameter, and both functions are within the same object / class, you can use <code>self.date = strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")</code> and on your other function use <code>self.date</code> when you need to read it.</p>

<p>Finally you can simply set a global variable, but depending on your project, this may cause bugs, if for example the code is multi-threaded (like a web application).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">i've test code as following :  def ready():    readyDate = strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")    print  readyDate    return;</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when ever i call this , it will give me the current date and time for sure , my code include differents functions one of these function will use  def ready and get output o it which is should be 2-3 sec behind ..</span>
