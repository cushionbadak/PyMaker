<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have used scrapy for several months.Several weeks ago,I started to use file to record log information.I wrote <code>log-to-file</code> function as this:    </p>
<pre><code>def logging_to_file(file_name):
import logging
from scrapy.utils.log import configure_logging

filename = '%s-log.txt' % file_name
import os

if os.path.isfile(filename):
    os.remove(filename)
configure_logging(install_root_handler=False)
logging.basicConfig(
    filename=filename,
    filemode='a',
    format='%(levelname)s: %(message)s',
    level=logging.DEBUG
)
return logging.getLogger()     
</code></pre>
<p>Then,in each scrapy spider class,I use <code>logger = logging_file.logging_to_file('./logs/xxx-%s' % time.strftime('%y%m%d'))</code> in <code>__init__</code> function to customize log file name.<br/>
Something went wrong today,I found if I wrote two scrapy classes in one <code>.py</code> file,and after I started spider of the second class,the log file was also  named by the file name which is given in the first class!<br/>
I think this is caused by python log rule,but I don't know how to resolve.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I understand what your question is but in general you don't have to create any functions or anything to configure your logger.</p>
<p>What you should do create a logger and assign it a <code>FileHandler</code> and then just use your created logger to log your info.</p>
<pre><code>import logging
logger = logging.getLogger('mylogger')  # skip name for global rules
fh = logging.FileHandler(LOG_FILE_DIR, mode='a')
logger.addHandler(fh)
</code></pre>
<p>You can put this anywhere that gets executed on program startup, like <code>__init__.py</code> or something.</p>
<p>Now when you want to log something just:</p>
<pre><code>logger = logging.getLogger('mylogger')
logger.error("error happened, oh no!")
</code></pre>
