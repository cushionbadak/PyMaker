<p>My time format is screwy, but it seemed workable, as a string with the following format:</p>
<pre><code>'47:37:00'
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to set a variable where:</p>
<pre><code>DT = '%H:%M:%S'
</code></pre>
<p>So I could find the difference between two times, but it's given me the following error:</p>
<pre><code>ValueError: time data '47:37:00' does not match format '%H:%M:%S'
</code></pre>
<p>Is it possible there are more elements to my time stamps than I thought? Or that it's formatted in minutes/seconds/milliseconds? I can't seem to find documentation that would help me determine my time format so I could set DT and do arithmetic on it.</p>
</div>

<p>It's because you set 47 to %H, that is not a proper value. 
Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime

dt = datetime.datetime.strptime('2016/07/28 12:37:00','%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S')

print dt
</code></pre>
<p>Output: 2016-07-28 12:37:00</p>

<p>You wrote "I can't seem to find documentation that would help me determine my time format so I could set DT and do arithmetic on it"</p>
<p>Try this:  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html</a></p>
<p>Way down to the bottom.</p>
<p>And yes, when the %H is matched with 47, you get boom the error.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Because 47 is not a valid hour?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks more like Minutes, Seconds, Microseconds?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is possible that 47 represents 1 day + 23 hours (24 + 23), but that depends entirely on how it is encoded. Perhaps you can tell based on your use case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, 47 did represent a day and 23 hours. Thanks for your notes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for this. That was indeed the issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Clearly I wasn't looking hard enough. Thanks! Appreciate it.</span>
