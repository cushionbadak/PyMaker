<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am messing around with string on an imageboard, and I want to be able to grab the board name from the end of the URL. I was wondering if I could possibly use %s to save it to another variable, but I only know how to use that to assign. Here is an example of the end of the URL.</p>
<pre><code>url = '/a/thread/144681013/'

board = #Where I want to save the 'a'
</code></pre>
<p>I can't just say it's at position <code>url[1]</code>, because the board could be more than 1 letter, like:</p>
<pre><code>url = '/fdf/thread/144681013/'

board = #Where I want to save the 'fdf'
</code></pre>
<p>I can't find an example in documentation anywhere, is there any placeholder I could put in the board that would automatically extract the board part of the url?</p>

<p>You can just <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow">split your string</a> at the <code>/</code> characters and grab the second element of the resulting list (the first one is empty because of the leading <code>/</code>)</p>
<pre><code>board = url.split('/')[1]
</code></pre>
<p>You could also use regular expressions if you wanted.</p>
<pre><code>import re
board = re.search('(?&lt;=^\/).*?(?=\/)', url).group()
</code></pre>
