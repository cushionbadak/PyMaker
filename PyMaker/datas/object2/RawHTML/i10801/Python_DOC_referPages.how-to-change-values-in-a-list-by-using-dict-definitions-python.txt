<p>I have a list <code>l = [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3]</code> and I want to use my dict <code>d = {1:'r', 2:'b', 3:'g'}</code> to get the result <code>l = [r, r, b, r, g, g, r, r, r, g]</code>? What is the most pythonic way to achieve this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Most Pythonic is probably a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a>:</p>
<pre><code>l = [d[x] for x in l]
</code></pre>
<p>For larger inputs, the following <em>might</em> be faster, but less Pythonic, as it pays a slightly higher setup cost but (on CPython reference interpreter) pushes the per-element work to the C layer, bypassing the (relatively slow) byte code interpreter:</p>
<pre><code>l = list(map(d.__getitem__, l))  # `list()` wrapping should be omitted on Python 2
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The following list comprehension will do:</p>
<pre><code>mapped = [d[item] for item in l]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that your expressions for list <code>l</code> will give syntax errors, at least in Python 2. You need commas between the items.</span>
