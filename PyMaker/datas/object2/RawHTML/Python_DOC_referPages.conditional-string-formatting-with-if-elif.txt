<p>one step further than <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9244909/how-to-implement-conditional-string-formatting">How to implement conditional string formatting?</a></p>
<p>Basically: is it possible to add <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>.... <code>else</code> in a format string?</p>
<pre><code>l = ['it', 'en', 'es']

for i in l:
    print('{tit}'.format(tit='Ciao' if i == 'it' elif i == 'en' tit='Hi' else 'Hola'))
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Author of the questions asks if it is possible to add if, elif, else in string formating. So, I do assume author wants to change the value of the string depending on some condition but wants to use if, elif, else for some reasons.</p>
<p>Here is my answer:</p>
<pre><code>t = ['Ciao' if x == 'it' else ('Hi' if x == 'en' else 'Hola') for x in ['it', 'en', 'es']]
</code></pre>
<p>I personally do not like if, elif, else logic in such case.</p>

<p>Although I would not recommend it - to answer the question:</p>
<p>It is <strong>not</strong> possible to use <code>elif</code> in a format string.</p>
<p>It is however possible to use nested conditional expressions:</p>
<pre><code>l = ['it', 'en', 'es']

for i in l:
    print('{tit}'.format(tit=('Ciao' if i == 'it' else 'Hi' if i == 'en' else 'Hola')))
</code></pre>
<p>outputs:</p>
<pre><code>Ciao
Hi
Hola
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">This would make a lot more sense as <code>{'it': 'Ciao', 'en': ...}</code>. While it's possible to have inline <code>if</code> expressions, which you could even chain to emulate something like <code>elif</code>, it's an insane an unmaintainable structure.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the general workflow I have is more complex to have a single dictionary like you suggested. Why is it insane?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If your workflow is so complex, why do you want to do all of it in a single line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just look at it, it's unreadable (and the actual working equivalent wouldn't be much better). Also, every time you may add one more item to <code>l</code>, you need to keep adding to that already unreadable expression everywhere you use such a thing in your code. That's why it's much better to define something like a dict upfront where the data which belongs together is defined together, and the rest is a generic algorithm which doesn't need to be hardcoded to <code>if i == 'it' â€¦</code>. Even if your actual case is more complex, there <i>are</i> certainly solutions that follow this better pattern.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok then I'll refactor the code. Thanks for the suggestions</span>
