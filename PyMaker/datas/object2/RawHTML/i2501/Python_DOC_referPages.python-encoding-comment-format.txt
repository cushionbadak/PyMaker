<p>Originally, I've learned to specify the source code encoding in Python 2.7 this way:</p>
<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
</code></pre>
<p>Now I just noticed, that PEP263 also allows this:</p>
<pre><code># coding=utf-8
</code></pre>
<p>Is there any differences between these? What about editor compatiblity, cross-platform etc.?</p>
<p>What about Python 3? Is this comment still needed for python 3 or is any code in python 3 expected to be utf-8 by default?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3120/" rel="noreferrer">PEP3120</a> which changed the default encoding of python source code to be UTF-8</p>
<p>For python 3.x one therefore finds in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#encoding-declarations" rel="noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a comment in the first or second line of the Python script matches
  the regular expression coding[=:]\s*([-\w.]+), this comment is
  processed as an encoding declaration [...] The <strong>recommended</strong> forms of an
  encoding expression are:</p>
<pre><code># -*- coding: &lt;encoding-name&gt; -*-
</code></pre>
<p>which is recognized also by GNU Emacs, and</p>
<pre><code># vim:fileencoding=&lt;encoding-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>which is recognized by Bram Moolenaarâ€™s VIM.
  If no encoding declaration is found, the <strong>default encoding is UTF-8</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The take home message is therefore:</p>
<ol>
<li>python 3.x does not neccessarily need to have utf-8 specified, since it is the default</li>
<li>The way the coding line is written is to some degree personal choice (only a recommendation in the docs), it only has to match the regex. </li>
</ol>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since Python 3 the default encoding is utf-8. You can still change the encoding using the special-formatted comment <code># -*- coding: &lt;encoding name&gt; -*-</code>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#encoding-declarations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> recommend to use this coding expression as it is recognized also by GNU Emacs.</p>
<p>As python checks whether the first two lines are matching the regex <code>coding[=:]\s*([-\w.]+)</code>, <br/><code># coding=utf-8</code> works also to ensure utf-8 encoding but it is not recognized by GNU Emacs.</p>
