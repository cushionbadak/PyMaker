<p>Well I am a newbie in python and i recently started with numpy intro. Starting with the comparison between numpy and list, numpy occupies less memory storage space. But after what i tried in the IDLE shell , I am confused.  Here's what I have done</p>
<pre><code>list1=[1,2,3]

sys.getsizeof(list1)

48
a=np.array([1,2,3])

sys.getsizeof(a)

60
</code></pre>
<p>Why is the numpy array, I created occupying more size than the list object? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First of all, <code>getsizeof</code> is not always the best way to compare the size of these two objects.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.getsizeof" rel="nofollow noreferrer">From the docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Only the memory consumption directly attributed to the object is accounted for, not the memory consumption of objects it refers to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To answer your question however, what you're seeing here is simply the additional overhead of a <code>numpy</code> array, which will provide skewed results on such a small input sample. </p>
<p>If you want to know the size of the <em>just the data</em> contained in a <code>numpy</code> array, there is an attribute you can check:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.array([1,2,3])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.nbytes
12
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.array([1,2,3], dtype=np.int8)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.nbytes
3
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.nbytes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This will not include the overhead</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does not include memory consumed by non-element attributes of the array object.</p>
