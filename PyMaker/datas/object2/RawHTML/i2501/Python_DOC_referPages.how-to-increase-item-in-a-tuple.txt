<p>6 and im trying to create sort of a loop to increase the item in a tuple example;</p>
<pre><code>list = [1,2,3]  
print (list[0]*&lt;----this is where im trying to create a loop*)  
</code></pre>
<p>(so the output shows this)</p>
<pre><code>    out:  1  
</code></pre>
<p>basically separate the integers and use them individually in a loop
this is what i got so far </p>
<pre><code>list = [1, 2, 3]  
list2 = [11, 12, 13]  
i = (0)  
i = i+1  
print ("tuples", list[0+i], list2[0+i])  
</code></pre>
<p>but i got this as a result</p>
<pre><code>out: 2, 12  
</code></pre>
<p>and im trying to get this as a result  </p>
<pre><code>out: 1, 11  
out: 2, 12  
out: 3, 13
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use :</p>
<pre><code>list1 = [1, 2, 3]  
list2 = [11, 12, 13] 

list3=[(list1[i],list2[i]) for i in range(len(list1))]
#[(1, 11), (2, 12), (3, 13)]
</code></pre>
<p>This is a list comprehension.</p>
<p>It's expanded for would be </p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(list1)):
    print( list1[i],list2[i] )

1 11
2 12
3 13
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should avoid creating a variable called <code>list</code> as that is a native Python keyword already!</p>
<p>You can also consider using <code>zip</code> in a loop if you want to operate both lists at the same time like this:</p>
<pre><code>list1 = [1, 2, 3]  
list2 = [11, 12, 13] 

for x, y in zip(list1, list2):
    print x, y
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>1 11
2 12
3 13
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You're using the term "tuple" to refer to lists.  In Python, a tuple is different from a list.  Also, there are no loops in the code you posted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was just using list as a place holder, I am using a tuple because is immutable to an extend, didn't want to disclose the actual code(complex and silly variables), sorry for the confusion , thank you tho</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ref for OP -- <code>[(list1[i],list2[i]) for i in range(len(list1))]</code> is an operation called list comprehension. see: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you that helped a lot sorting the lists ,but i'm trying to create a loop where list1[0+i(increase this number)] and print the increasing value until it reaches the maximum which will be three, but so far it only prints the second value, how can i loop it so it does that three times thank you for the link too</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@papisilv I did not get you, can you add what your expected output would be in a clear format? Is it <code>[ (1,2,3), (11,12,13) ]</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sure im trying to get this ///output : [1,11] //// output [2,12] /////output[3,13] instead of doing this print(list1[0])  and print(list1[1]) and print(list1[2]), it might not be possible or too complex for my basic understanding sorry</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@papisilv Check the edited <code>for</code> loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah i just used list as a place holder for the name, i did not feel  like disclosing the  silly labels i use, thank you tho</span>
