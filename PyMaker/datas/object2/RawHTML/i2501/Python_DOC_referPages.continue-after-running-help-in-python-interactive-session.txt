<p>I run the following code in Python Interactive Session and try to get help on the method 'load' from json but i don't know to continue my instructions after (END),</p>

 result of any object literal decode (a ``dict``). The return value of
    ``object_hook`` will be used instead of the ``dict``. This feature
    can be used to implement custom decoders (e.g. JSON-RPC class hinting).

    ``object_pairs_hook`` is an optional function that will be called with the
    result of any object literal decoded with an ordered list of pairs.  The
    return value of ``object_pairs_hook`` will be used instead of the ``dict``.
    This feature can be used to implement custom decoders.  If ``object_hook``
    is also defined, the ``object_pairs_hook`` takes priority.

    To use a custom ``JSONDecoder`` subclass, specify it with the ``cls``
    kwarg; otherwise ``JSONDecoder`` is used.

<span class="comment-copy">It will help you in the long run to realize when you are in a "pager" application, and to understand the keybindings of yours.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually on my system, it's simply running <code>less</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you have set the PAGER env var to <code>less</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>PAGER</code> is not set.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is some horrible code in <code>pydoc.getpager()</code> which conditionally checks if <code>less</code> is executable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do a <code>man man</code> which should tell you the default for <code>PAGER</code>.  On my system it is <code>/usr/bin/less -is</code> but it will vary between installations.</span>
