<p>I am working with multiple multidimensional arrays. Let us consider dummy example for simplicity:</p>
<pre><code> array_list=[np.ones(3), np.ones((3,3,3)), np.ones((3,3)), np.ones(3)]
</code></pre>
<p>I need to subscribe the outermost dimension of each array in the list. For example, my goal is to set some of the elements to zero according to a specified range in the outermost dimension:</p>
<pre><code>array_list[0][0:2]=0
array_list[1][:,:,0:2]=0
array_list[2][:,0:2]=0
array_list[3][0:2]=0
</code></pre>
<p>In my real application I don't know how many arrays I have and how many dimensions are in there.</p>
<p>I would like to do the task in a for loop:</p>
<pre><code>for array in array_list:
    array[???]=0
</code></pre>
<p>But I am struggling how to implement this if I don't know the dimensionality of each array.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#Ellipsis" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ellipsis</a> to select all dimensions except the last (if there's only 1, nothing is selected).</p>
<pre><code>for array in array_list:
    array[..., 0:2] = 0
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@piRSquared I remember losing a question to another answerer who did something similar... it really sticks when you learn it that way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the answer. The documentation is not very specific, but it works great</span>
