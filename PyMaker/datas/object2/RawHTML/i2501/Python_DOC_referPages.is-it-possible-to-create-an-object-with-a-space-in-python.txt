<p>Is it possible to create an object named 'Stack Overflow' and is valued 5.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>stack overflow = 5
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>No. You will get a syntax error. You can however use spaces in the keys in a dict:</p>
<pre><code>mydict = {}
mydict['stack overflow'] = 42
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What happened when you tried?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I get Syntax error obviously, but was wondering if there was a way</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you get a SyntaxError then the answer should be obvious... But you can refer to the official documentation too : <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there any language where this is even possible?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can create an <i>object</i> with a name attribute, and name anything you like. You can't create a <i>variable</i> with a space in its name. Variable names don't have to match things real names.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know I will get a syntax error. But, was wondering if maybe there was a way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Berkay You cannot. It is simply not allowed.
