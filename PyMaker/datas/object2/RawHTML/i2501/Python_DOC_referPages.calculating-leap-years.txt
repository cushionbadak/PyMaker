<p>I have an assignment that is supposed to calculate whether a year that the user inputs is in fact a leap year. I cannot figure out the formula for this. Can anyone help? I can figure out the rest of the code but here is what is needed:</p>
<p><strong>The month of February normally has 28 days. But if it is a leap year, February has 29 days.
Write a program that asks the user to enter a year. The program should then display the
number of days in February that year. Use the following criteria to identify leap years:
1. Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and only
if it is also divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year, but 2100 is not.
2. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 4.
For example, 2008 is a leap year, but 2009 is not.</strong></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>from calendar import isleap
year=input('Year: ')
if isleap(int(year)):
   print(29)
else:
   print(28)
</code></pre>
<p>Or without import:</p>
<pre><code>year=input('Year: ')
if year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0):
    print(29)
else:
    print(28)
</code></pre>

<p>The assignment contains the logic/steps in prose; write the steps in comments and then convert the comments to code.</p>
<p>I've done the first bit below, including the relevant "comment instructions". Now write the code below each comment. Among other things, the code should contain <code>if/then/else</code> and use the <code>%</code> (modulus) operator.</p>
<pre><code># 1. Determine whether the year is divisible by 100.
# If it is, then it is a leap year if and only if it is also divisible by 400 [otherwise it is not a leap year]

# 2. [otherwise, ] If the year is not divisible by 100,
# then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 4 [otherwise it is not a leap year]
</code></pre>
<p>To structure code cleaner, consider putting the comments/logic inside a function:</p>
<pre><code>def is_leapyear (year):
    # comments and logic here
    # and 'return' true or false

# call is_leapyear in main program, supplying the year to test
</code></pre>
<p>Coding takes <em>a lot</em> of practice .. so practice :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I appreciate everyone's help. I see now that the percent is a remainder symbol. So when divided ( year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 ==0) as well as the initial division by 4, the answer is true as long as there are no remainders. I was curious as to how I could manage coming to a number being divisible to be true in an equation. I was not trying to get anyone to do it for me, however this has been a major step in helping me to understand an operand I have never used before</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@dizzL You may also want to look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#divmod" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>divmod</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RedCricket I simply hadn't used the modulus before as I am just learning in the first couple of chapters. I have done plenty of coding the past few hours for other examples and this one had me stumped.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2864740 Tank you for your help. although I understood the instructions, I could not translate to code as far as finding out a way to use dividends without remainders</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@leewz Thanks! Good to know more built-in methods</span>
