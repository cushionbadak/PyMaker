<p>one </p>

<p>one </p>
<p>two </p>
<p>is </p>
<p>two </p>

<p>Where I need to modify to print in desired order?</p>

<p>Per taoufik's comment, you want to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">split</a> each sentence before iterating over it. This is because, by default, when you iterate over a string in Python it will go character by character. By calling <code>split</code>, you split the string (by spaces) into a list of words. See below.</p>
<pre><code>ls = ["one is one","two is two","three is three"]

for sentence in ls:
    for word in sentence.split():
        print(word)

one
is 
one
two
is
two
three
is
three
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">use the split method on <code>each_item</code> <code>for each_word in each_item.split()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why down-voting? Is it a question of substandard?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While the question is relatively basic, it was well formulated and asked. I don't think the down votes are warranted @hanugm</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not the downvoter, but I think they are due to using images in the output instead of actual text. But nevertheless, not warranted.</span>
