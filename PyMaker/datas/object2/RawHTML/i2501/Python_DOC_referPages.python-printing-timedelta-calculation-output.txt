<p>I have the following python code to calculate how many days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds an amount of marsdays is. I want the output to be: </p>
<p>x sols = x days, x hours, x minutes, x seconds, x milliseconds</p>
<p>I found out I had to use timedelta because it uses milliseconds, which I need.</p>
<p>I have written the following code but it doesn't give a correct output for the values. When they're &gt;60 they need to be passed on because 60 seconds equals 1 hour. But the values can go &gt;60. for example, when I enter a value &gt;1, like 4, I get the aswer: 4 sol =  4 days, 2 hours, 38 minutes, 7220 seconds, 976 milliseconds.</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, timedelta
sol = timedelta(hours=24,minutes=39,seconds=35,milliseconds=244)
amount = input("Amount of sols: ")
earth=int(amount)*sol
hours = int(earth.seconds/3600)
minutes = int((earth.seconds-(hours*3600))/60)
secondes = int(earth.seconds-(minutes*60))
millisecondes = int(earth.microseconds/1000)
print (amount + " sol = " + str(earth.days) + ' days, ' + str(hours) + ' hours, ' + str(minutes) + ' minutes, ' + str(secondes) + ' secondes, ' + str(millisecondes) + ' millisecondes')
</code></pre>
<p>The hours, minutes and milliseconds are calculated this way because timedelta can't give them apparently. </p>
<pre><code>earth.days
earth.seconds
</code></pre>
<p>exist, but </p>
<pre><code>earth.hours
earth.minutes
earth.milliseconds
</code></pre>
<p>don't exist. which I don't understand because I can give them values as seen on line 2.</p>
<p>I think the way I try to achieve what i want isn't correct.</p>

<p>I think if you use "seconds" as a floating point number instead of the <code>datetime</code> library it will work better. The <code>datetime</code> library has a lot of assumptions around Earth dates and times that won't really be valid on Mars.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hint: You forgot a term when calculating <code>secondes</code>. I bet that your <code>secondes</code> is off by a multiple of 3600.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think I have, when i enter 1 as input the values presented are correct. Just when I enter a value &gt;1, like 4, I get the aswer: 4 sol =  4 days, 2 hours, 38 minutes, 7220 seconds, 976 milliseconds.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">7220 is off by 2*3600. You forgot to subtract <i>something else</i> when calculating <code>secondes</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think using timedelta alone will have such issues, but I agree that asker should reconsider using timedelta instead of a float.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Isn't he suggesting it the other way around? That I have to use timedelta as a floating point?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sjoerd1234 He suggests that you use a <code>float</code> to represent seconds instead of going through <code>timedelta</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">He is definitely suggesting using a <code>float</code> instead of a <code>timedelta</code>.</span>
