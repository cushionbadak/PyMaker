<p>I have a defined function:</p>

<p>I have tried to apply this function on my list of lists using many method but none of them work.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The below gives AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'split'</p>
<pre><code>list(map(len,filtered_wordList))

<li><p>This gives an TypeError: map() missing 1 required positional argument: 'txt'</p>
<pre><code>[map(item) for item in filtered_wordList]

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you use your function map like this: </p>
<pre><code>text = 'Stack Overflow is great'
map(2, text)
</code></pre>
<p>It outputs:</p>
<pre><code>[('Stack', 2, 1), ('Overflow', 2, 1), ('is', 2, 1), ('great', 2, 1)]
</code></pre>
<p>Your function takes in an <code>id</code> variable and a text (which should be a string). 
It splits the text on space like this:</p>
<pre><code>['Stack', 'Overflow', 'is', 'great'] 
</code></pre>
<p>And loops over each word in this list and adds a tuple which includes the word, the id you passes and 1 to your <code>mapop</code> list like this:</p>
<pre><code>('Stack', 2, 1)
</code></pre>
<p>After it loops over each word, it returns <code>mapop</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As others have pointed out, the immediate problem is that you're arguing with yourself: you haven't been consistent about what arguments your function should use -- whether the input text is a single sentence or a list of sentences.  I took the liberty of changing the function name.  Here's a suggested use that I think solves your problem.  You can reduce several of the statement blocks to a single line, but I expect the current version is more readable for you.</p>
<pre><code>filtered_wordlist = [
    'Call me Ishmael',
    'The boy was odd',
    'They could only say it just "happened to happen" and was not very likely to happen again.'
]

def word_id(id,txt):
   mapop= []
   words = txt.split()
   for word in words:
     tmp= (word,id,1)
     mapop.append(tmp)
   return mapop 


lexicon = []
for id, sentence in enumerate(filtered_wordlist):
    lexicon.append(word_id(id, sentence))

print(lexicon)
</code></pre>
<p>Output (with extra line breaks for readability):</p>
<pre><code>[('Call', 0, 1), ('me', 0, 1), ('Ishmael', 0, 1),
 ('The', 1, 1), ('boy', 1, 1), ('was', 1, 1), ('odd', 1, 1),
 ('They', 2, 1), ('could', 2, 1), ('only', 2, 1), ('say', 2, 1),

<span class="comment-copy">"I have tried to apply this function on my list of lists" - why? This function wasn't written to take a list of lists.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112 I want to know how to apply this function on atleast one of the list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">in addition to everything else, <code>map</code> is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built-in Python function</a>, and while it's allowed to redefine it as you are doing here, it's generally a (very) bad idea</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This function is written to take whatever the heck <code>id</code> was supposed to be, and a string. I don't know what's in your <code>filtered_wordlist</code>, but it's not whatever-<code>id</code>-was-supposed-to-be and a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>filtered_wordlist</code> seems to be a list of lists. Hence you might be ending up passing a list rather than a string.</span>
