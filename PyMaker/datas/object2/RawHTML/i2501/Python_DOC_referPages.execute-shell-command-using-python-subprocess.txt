<p>I want to execute the following command via a python script:</p>
<pre><code>sudo cat &lt;/dev/tcp/time.nist.gov/13
</code></pre>
<p>I can execute this command via the command line completely fine. However, when I execute it using subprocess, I get an error:</p>
<pre><code>Command ['sudo','cat','&lt;/dev/tcp/time.nist.gov/13'] returned non-zero exit status 1
</code></pre>
<p>My code is as follows</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.check_output(['sudo','cat','&lt;/dev/tcp/time.nist.gov/13'])
</code></pre>
<p>As I mentioned above, executing the command via the command line gives the desired output without any error. I am using the Raspbian Jessie OS. Can someone point me in the right direction?</p>

<p>You don't want to use <code>subprocess</code> for this at all.</p>
<p>What does this command really do?  It uses a bash extension to open a network socket, feeds it through <strong>cat</strong>(1) to reroute it to standard output, and decides to run cat as root.  You don't really need the bash extension, or <code>/bin/cat</code>, or root privileges to do any of this in Python; you're looking for the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">socket</a> library.</p>
<p>Here's an all-Python equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3
import socket
s = socket.create_connection(('time.nist.gov', 13))
try:
    print(s.recv(4096))
finally:
    s.close()
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that all of my experimentation suggests that this connection works but the daytime server responds by closing immediately.  For instance, the simpler shell invocation <code>nc time.nist.gov 13</code> also returns empty string.)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Give this a try:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess

com = "sudo cat &lt;/dev/tcp/time.nist.gov/13"

subprocess.Popen(com, stdout = subprocess.PIPE, shell = True)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The redirection operator <code>&lt;</code> is part of shell functionality. Your call doesn't use the shell so <code>cat</code> processes the parameter directly (and doesn't understand it)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MichaelButscher Thanks for the reply. How do I execute this command using subprocess then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>check_output</code> supports a <code>shell</code> parameter for that</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Works. Thanks :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you explain why subprocess is the wrong way to approach this? Besides the fact it isn't working for Umar haha</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In general it's both easier and faster to try to do things natively in a single language if you can.  If you're using <code>subprocess</code> for basic file I/O (ls cat grep sed ...) (or in this case, network I/O) you should just use your local language primitives for it instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doesnt work, error: cannot open /dev/tcp/time.nist.gov/13L No such file or directory</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Turn it into the full path. I don't know what that is on your pc. Ie, C:/User/.../dev/tcp/time.nist.gov/13. Or put the script into the same folder as the application you are trying to call.</span>
