<p>So I'm using Python's logger and it has built in functions like <code>logger.debug()</code> which are very useful. I also have a send email class that I want to run. How can I have <code>SendEmail()</code> run every time I call <code>logger.error()</code>?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is supported directly in stdlib <code>logging</code>.  Create an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#smtphandler" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>SMTPHandler</code></a> and add it in your logging configuration, configured with level <code>logging.ERROR</code>. There are several logging configuration methods available, documented <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You need to add an additional handler to the logger object.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I saw that but I'm doing some other specific things so I need to be able to run my class</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JasonAtallah You can define your own class based on one of the handler classes provided in the stdlib logging package, or any third party logging handler, for that matter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JasonAtallah As Vinay suggested, subclass <code>SMTPHandler</code> and add/modify what you want.  stdlib logging is intentionally pluggable/flexible.</span>
