<p>I want to replace the sentences with different name and I do not know why it is does works</p>
<pre><code>text="hi, my name is angle enrico, how is everything going?"

print(s)

<p>I want to have an output 'how is everything going?',but I am getting'hi, my name is angle enrico, how is everything going?' 
Anyone know how to solve it? </p>

<p>It looks like you are trying to use regex syntax in a non-regex context. What your code is currently doing is searching for the literal string <code>hi, my name is\s+</code>, which clearly does not exist in your input string.</p>
<p>What you need to do is write a regex that will capture the beginning of the string, and then pass that into the <code>text.replace</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using:</p>
<pre><code>s = text.replace('hi, my name is','')
print(' '.join(s.split()[2:]))
</code></pre>
<p>Or:</p>
<pre><code>print(text.split(', ')[2])
</code></pre>
<p>Both reproduce:</p>
<pre><code>how is everything going?
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; text="hi, my name is angle enrico, how is everything going?"
&gt;&gt;&gt; pre = text[text.index("hi, my name is ")+len("hi, my name is "):]
&gt;&gt;&gt; pre
'angle enrico, how is everything going?'
&gt;&gt;&gt; suf = pre[pre.index(", ")+len(", "):]
&gt;&gt;&gt; suf
'how is everything going?'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to use a regex and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re</a> module.</p>
<p>You want to replace the part of the string starting with 'Hi, my name is', followed by anything (<code>.*</code>), then a comma and at least one space (<code>,\s+</code>). </p>
<p>If the end of the sentence can contain commas as well, you need to take the smallest possible 'anything', so you have to do it in a non-greedy way (<code>.*?</code>).</p>
<p>So, you could do:</p>
<pre><code>import re

text="hi, my name is angle enrico, how is everything going?"

s = re.sub(r'hi, my name is .*?,\s+', '', text)
print(s)
#how is everything going?
</code></pre>
<p>It also works with a second comma further in the sentence:</p>
<pre><code>text="hi, my name is fred,   I'm fine, thanks!"
s = re.sub(r'hi, my name is .*?,\s+', '', text)
print(s)
#I'm fine, thanks!
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">if the <i>rule</i> you are trying to code is <i>remove "hi, my name is angle enrico, "</i> then <code>text.replace("hi, my name is angle enrico,", "")</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have different sentences with a lot of different names, that what I am doing \s+ instead of the name</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Uncommon use, can you get more sample input and expect output?</span>
