<pre><code>r = range(1,6)
for counter1 in r:
    for counter2 in range(len(r)-counter1):
        print ("."),
    print (counter1),
    for counter3 in range (counter1 - 1):
        print ("."),
    print ("")

<p>When hitting run on IDLE Python this is the output i get: <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wg3J0.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python IDLE Output</a></p>
<p>But when I run it on an online GUI such as trinket.io this is the output: <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0yoI8.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Trinket.io Output</a></p>
<p>I want it to display the output on IDLE like it does on trinket.io, how do i do that? As you can see IDLE makes a new line for every dot</p>

<p>trinket is using python 2</p>
<p>in python 3 the comma thing to keep in the same line doesn't work, you have to replace it with the <code>end=</code> parameter:</p>
<p>This python 2 line</p>
<pre><code>print ("."),
</code></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre><code>print(".", end=" ")
</code></pre>
<p>in python 3</p>

<p>This solved it, the issue was that trinket was using Python 2 and IDLE was using 3.7. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">You don't seem to be clear on whether you want Python 2 or Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The IDLE Python is running on 3.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print (something),</code> with a comma does something different in Python 2 from Python 3. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> for information about how to use Python 3's <code>print</code> function.</span>
