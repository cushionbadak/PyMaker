<p>(I am using python 3.6.6 if that matters to anyone)</p>
<p>I am making a GUI installer for a game that is currently in private alpha and is constantly updating. </p>

<p>I will only be using this to download 1 specific link so ignore the url variable.</p>
<p>I am trying to make a GUI that does the same thing when I click a button that says 'Download'. I want to make a progress bar, and a text box that tells you what is going on e.g. Downloading, extracting etc. I have no need for a directory option. I just need it to download where ever the file is located and delete the old file if it is still there.</p>
<p>So here is my question: How do I learn how to do this? I have looked at tkinter tutorials and other questions but I only find stuff for python 2 or stuff that is to developed to modify and call my own work. What I am looking for are links and/or examples that can tell me how I go about creating something like this. Thanks in advance to anyone who helps me out.</p>
<p>P.S. I am a noob when it comes to coding so whatever you explain please do it thoroughly.</p>
<p>P.S.S. In order to run the console application you need to run it through terminal and add your own link in the 'url' variable.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PySimpleGUI</a>. You can build a layout with a download button, an output window and a progress bar easily.  Stop by the GitHub and post an issue if you run into trouble.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">there's virtually no difference with tkinter in python 2 and python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Personally, I like wxPython much more than Tkinter. Namely, it has support for native OS UI elements. <a href="https://wxpython.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wxpython.org</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, I will look into it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would also like to point out that <code>print(''); print("Download Complete."); print(''); print('')</code> is equivalent to: <code>print("\nDownload Complete.\n\n")</code>, which is much cleaner code. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I put this as a solution because it would most certainly work and I will be using it in the future. Sadly, due to this answer being so late, I have already written 100+ lines of codes using wxpython, which someone else had previously recommended. Thanks anyway!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'll bet you could rewrite your 100 lines of WxPython code within an hour in 40 lines of PySimpleGUI code :-)  Anyway, thanks for the vote</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you looked at my console code you can see I already have used tqdm and from what I can tell there is no way to use this in a GUI application. If I am wrong please explain how to do so.</span>
