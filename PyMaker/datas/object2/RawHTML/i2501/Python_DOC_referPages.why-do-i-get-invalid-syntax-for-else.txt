<p>Your solution might be this one:</p>
<pre><code>names=["MARTIN","JAMES","LOUIS","BABYSHARK"]
name = input('Enter your name:').upper()

if name in names:
    print('You can play my game')
else:
    print('Access Denied')

<p>You need to add colons after your if and else statements. Also you need to indent the code in the if segment.</p>

<p>Welcome to Stack Overflow. I suggest you read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the python documentation about if statements</a>. This clearly defines the syntax. The most common thing to miss is a colon after the condition of your <code>if</code> and after <code>else</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">hi I'm using python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It should be <code>else: print ( "ACCES DENIED!")</code>. Add colon after else and remove extra bracket from the end. Make sure to use proper language tags, include error text and always write code with indentation. Use backtick character or indentation to write code.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Please add your code to the question instead of linking to an image.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">mark Keven thank you this solved it! Thanks for very fast answer I’m new to python and just started learning it..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">colons should be use in C language. Python language uses indentation</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@markkeven I think you are confusing <b>semi</b>colon(;) with colon(:). C and many other languages use seimcolons to end a line. Python just uses the new line terminator. This has nothing to do with indentation. Python uses colon in several places, including with <code>if..else</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oops apologize my mistake. I thought <b>;</b> as colon</span>
