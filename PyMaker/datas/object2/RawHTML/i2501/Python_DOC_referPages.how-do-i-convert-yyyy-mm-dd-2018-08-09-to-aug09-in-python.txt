<p>I'm plotting a graph with anaconda and it's taking a start_dt = x1[0] and end_dt = x1[29]. There are 30 values on the x axis. Right now, the date getting picked is already in Aug09 form. But I want to switch to another file where the dates are in yyyy-mm-dd form. How do I change the format of the date when it's getting passed to the state_dt and end_dt?</p>
<pre><code>plt.suptitle(heading + start_dt + '-' + end_dt, size=26, fontweight='bold', va='top')
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>date_str = '2018-08-09'
d = datetime.strptime(date_str, '%Y-%m-%d')
print(d.strftime('%b%d')
</code></pre>
