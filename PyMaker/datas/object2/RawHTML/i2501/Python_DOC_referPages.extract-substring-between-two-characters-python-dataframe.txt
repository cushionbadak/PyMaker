<p>What is the meaning of string locator <code>', \s*([^\.]*)\s*\.'</code> =?</p>
<p>I have a dataframe identical to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44000278/extract-sub-string-between-2-special-characters-from-one-column-of-pandas-datafr">Extract sub-string between 2 special characters from one column of Pandas DataFrame</a></p>
<p>and want to extract the substring located between <code>","</code> and <code>"."</code>.  Thanks to the post answer, a way would be as below:</p>
<pre><code>In [157]: df['Title'] = df.Name.str.extract(r',\s*([^\.]*)\s*\.', expand=False)

In [158]: df
Out[158]:
                   Name   Title
0        Jim, Mr. Jones      Mr
1     Sara, Miss. Baker    Miss
2     Leila, Mrs. Jacob     Mrs
3  Ramu, Master. Kuttan  Master
</code></pre>
<p>Although I see the outcome being correct, what is the meaning of <code>',\s*([^\.]*)\s*\.'</code>? In particular, what is the meaning of '*' and '\'?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It means the following, match:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>,</code> (comma)</li>
<li>followed by <code>\s*</code> zero or more whitespaces characters (tab, spaces, etc)</li>
<li>followed by <code>([^\.])*</code> zero or more characters that are not a <code>.</code> (dot) </li>
<li>followed by <code>\s*</code> zero or more whitespaces characters</li>
<li>followed by a <code>\.</code> (dot)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more about regex in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>As @UnbearableLightness mentioned the character <code>\</code> is redundant inside a character set to escape the <code>.</code> (dot). A character set is anything defined between <code>[]</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The \ in the character set is escaping the dot, which is of course redundant. A \ will still be matched by the expression.</span>
