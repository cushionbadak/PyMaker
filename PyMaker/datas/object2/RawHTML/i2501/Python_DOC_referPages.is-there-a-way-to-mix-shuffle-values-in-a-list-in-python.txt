<p>I am trying to create a Deck of cards type scenario, which I want to 'shuffle' and then pick a 'card'. The cards are in a list as 'S6' (6 of spades), 'CJ' (Jack of Clubs) and I want a card to be picked from index value 0 (top of the deck), and so would like to be able to move around each value in the list randomly. </p>
<p>Side question- Would picking a card by using a randomly generated index number produce a similar result? Coding Newboy here!</p>

<p>Yes. You can use <code>random.shuffle()</code> to mix up a list.</p>
<p>If you had a deck with the cards in order you could do something like</p>
<p><code>random.shuffle(deck)</code></p>

<p>As @dawg says, use random.shuffle:</p>
<pre><code>import random
items = ['jack', 'king', 'queen', 'ace']
random.shuffle(items)
</code></pre>
<p>The function applies the change <code>in-place</code>, which means it alters the original object passed in and returns <code>None</code>.</p>
