<p>This code is taken from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEA31vHiry4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Khan Academy video</a>. However, when I try to run it myself both on Jupyter Notebook and IDLE it outputs None. I can't figure out why when it's exactly the same from the video.
Thanks in advance for helping.</p>

<p>Your function doesn't have a <code>return</code> statement anywhere. If a function doesn't <code>return</code> anything explicitly, it always returns <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>And it's almost certainly intentional that this function doesn't return anything.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Notice that the function mutates its argument in-place:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [7,1,3,5,9,2,3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; insertion_sort(a)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
[1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 9]
</code></pre>
<p>In Python, it's idiomatic for functions that do this to not return anything. See, for example, builtin methods like <code>list.sort</code> and <code>list.append</code>.</p>
<p>And notice that <a href="https://youtu.be/lEA31vHiry4?t=7m45s" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in the cited video</a>, this is exactly what the instructor does—they don't <code>print</code> the result of <code>insertion_sort</code>, they just call it, and then look at the value of the variable.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Also, in general, functions that mutate a value in-place, like this one, take an imperative verb, like the list method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sort</code></a>, while functions that leave the argument unchanged but return a transformed value, take a past participle, like the built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sorted</code></a>.</p>
<p>So, if this function were named <code>insertion_sorted</code>, Python programmers would expect it to leave its argument alone and return a new, sorted list; since it's named <code>insertion_sort</code>, they'll expect it to sort its argument in-place and return nothing.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You don't have a <code>return</code> statement anywhere, so your function always returns <code>None</code>. What did you <i>expect</i> it to return?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">return list after else: break</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the comment above is clearly correct - but to clear up any confusion, what you probably meant to do was: call <code>insertion_sort(a)</code> (no <code>print</code> needed), then <code>print(a)</code> to see the result</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I note that the video never uses <code>print()</code>, only you used <code>print()</code>. See the <a href="https://youtu.be/lEA31vHiry4?t=7m45s" rel="nofollow noreferrer">7:45 mark and onwards</a>, where Khan <i>explains</i> why the function doesn't return anything as the list is sorted in-place.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Martijn: he doesn't <i>explain</i> why it doesn't return anything. He <i>asserts</i> that it doesn't return anything and also that it sorts in place. Both of those are facts, but if there is a relation between them -- which is what an <i>explanation</i> would be -- he leaves it implicit. Nothing stops the function from returning the sorted array, but it doesn't. Why not? Because, <i>pythonic</i>. But explaining that would take a lot more video.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The video never uses <code>print()</code>, and instead drives the function directly from the Python interpreter window exactly as you do in your answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/lEA31vHiry4?t=7m45s" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Start at 7:45m into the video</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters OK, and…? How does that make any part of this answer wrong, or misleading? I'm happy to add a comment to that effect (although commenting on something that the OP left out of the question is always a bit tricky), but I don't think anything major needs to be changed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"And this is almost certainly intentional." To be clear, answerer means that the function <code>insertion_sort</code> intentionally does not return a specific value, not that the language intentionally returns None when there's no return statement (although that is also intentional).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abarnert: I had the sound of before, but the narrator (Khan himself, older video) explicitly states that the function doesn't return anything because it sorts the list in-place.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think it'd be helpful to newbies if it were more explicit that <code>sorted</code> really is a (built-in) function, not just a function one could in theory create.</span>
