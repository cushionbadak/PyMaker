<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is the code.</p>
<pre><code>n = int(input("Enter number of strings: "))
for i in range(n):
    ai= input("Enter string ")
i=0
print(ai)

<ul>
<li>Why does it give last string and not the first string?</li>
<li>If I try to print a0 ,it gives error.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that I can use lists , but I didn't know about list when I wrote the program and now I have to change everything to use list.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because you are overwriting the variable in each iteration of the loop, if you want to print all the strings added in the format you can use something like this</p>
<pre><code>n = int(input('enter number of strings'));
ai = ''
for i in range(n):
   ai += input('enter a string: ')+'\n'
i = 0
print(ai)
</code></pre>
<p>This will print your string.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should use a list and append every input to the list instead:</p>
<pre><code>n = int(input("Enter number of strings: "))
a = []
for _ in range(n):
    a.append(input("Enter string: "))
print(a[0])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, you need to change the program to use a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is this for school? What results were you expecting?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"change everything"? You need to either store your inputted data in some kind of datastructure <i>or</i> you have to digest/process it immediately, before it is overwritten by the next input. you can put a <code>l = []</code> before your for-loop and a <code>l.append(ai)</code> after you questioned for the string. You can process the list after the inputs this way. Beside that, I highly recommend using / working with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a> to learn the basics. SO is not really good at "teaching" those, we are more for when you already have some basic knowledge and got a snag in your programm</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You know you need list. Now go to docs or tutorials and learn how to use lists.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is for my college. I was expecting to get first string. Why do I get error when I print (a0)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think I should change everything now. Thanks for the answer. Which tutorial is best to study python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welcome. You can start with the official tutorial: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a></span>
