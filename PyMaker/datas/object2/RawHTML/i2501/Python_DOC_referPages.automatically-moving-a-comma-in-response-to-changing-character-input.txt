<p>I am a beginner to using Python (3.7.0 is the release) and am trying to make a comma appear after a word in a print statement whilst maintaining an overall structure to the output. This is better explained by the following, which includes a snippet of code:</p>
<pre><code>fname = input('Please enter your first name &gt; ')
lname = input('Please enter your last name &gt; ')

print('+------------------------------------------------+')
print('|   -|         ',lname.ljust(10)+',',fname.ljust(9)+'            |')
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>I want the print statement to place the comma directly after the lname 
   variable's last inputted character, 
   allowing for up to 10 characters to be inputted for the last name and 9 for the 
   first name.</p>
<p>Ex: If I inputted my fname as "Jace" and my lname as "Smith", I would like the 
   comma to be placed immediately after "Jace",
   so that the statement would print:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>+------------------------------------------------+
|   -|        Smith, Jace                        |
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>whilst maintaining the position of the far-most-right bar "|", regardless of 
   if the fname and lname inputs vary
   in the character-amount range specified by the left-justified formatting 
   modifiers. If my name was change to 
   "Tyler Campbell" I would still want the output to be:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>+------------------------------------------------+
|   -|        Campbell, Tyler                    |
</code></pre>
<p>Can someone help me out? This is my first time using these forums, so hopefully this isn't placed in the wrong category or formatted wrong.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>ljust</code> means “left justify”—add spaces on the right end to pad the string. If you don’t want that, don’t call <code>ljust</code>. I’m not sure what you <i>do</i> want here. Maybe it’s <code>rjust</code>? Or maybe you want to add the comma between the names and then <code>ljust</code> that, instead of adding to comma to already-padded name?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you care what happens if the input is too long?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@gilch I do not care what happens if input exceeds 9 and 10 characters, respectively.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this works correctly if the lname and fname inputs are 10 characters long and 9 characters long, respectively, but if they are less than those specific lengths the far-right bar (|) gets shifted to the left by one space. Any further ideas? I am reading up on the mini language, thanks for the link.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jace sorry, I got the 9 and 10 swapped. Try it now. You should be able test it and make adjustments like that.</span>
