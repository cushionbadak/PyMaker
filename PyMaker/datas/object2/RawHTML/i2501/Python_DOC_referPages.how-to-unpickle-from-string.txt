<p>I have a series of Pickle files that are compressed using gzip. Due to size issue, I read the file in the gzip compressed format and decompress them in the memory only when I need them. That is, </p>
<pre><code>my_zip_content = open(file_name, 'rb').read()
my_pickle_content = zlib.decompress(my_zip_content, 15 + 32)
original_content = UNPICKLE(my_pickle_content) # How ?
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is, I cannot find an API (i.e., <code>UNPICKLE</code>) to unpickle string. Any help is greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>You want <code>pickle.loads()</code> which means "load string," see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.loads" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.loads</a></p>
