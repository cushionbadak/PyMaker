<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text file in the same directory labelled test.txt. It contains the following 3 lines:</p>
<pre><code>10
3
5
</code></pre>
<p>The output this gives me is:</p>
<pre><code>1
0

3
</code></pre>
<p>My code is below.</p>
<pre><code>f = open('test.txt',"r")
test1 =(f.readline(1))
test2 = (f.readline(2))
test3 = (f.readline(3))
print (test1)
print (test2)
print (test3)
</code></pre>
<p>How would i go about making it pick up the full variables? Ie test1 = 10, test2=3, test3 = 5?
Very new to python :(</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't have to give <code>f.readline()</code> an argument at all:</p>
<pre><code>test1 = f.readline()
test2 = f.readline()
test3 = f.readline()
</code></pre>
<p>otherwise you <em>limit</em> the number of characters read. <code>f.readline(1)</code> does <em>not</em> mean 'read line 1'; instead you say: 'read a line, but no more than 1 character should be read'.</p>
<p>Quoting from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.IOBase.readline" rel="nofollow"><code>IOBase.readline()</code> docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read and return one line from the stream. If <em>size</em> is specified, <strong>at most <em>size</em> bytes will be read.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@MortezaIpo: What in heavens name does that gist have to do with what the OP is asking about?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters as I said hope that be useful.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MortezaIpo: sure, but it isn't. Not in any way that I can see. Perhaps you meant to link to a different gist (that link is over a year old), but in general a link to a gist without explanation isn't much help to begin with.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters I see. you are right. it just has a simple description.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So simple, so elegant, so much noobiness on my part. Thanks for the explanation, i appreciate it!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, heres my problem now. It can print the item happily, but when i recall the variable its giving me things like "10\n".  So i did a bit of research and i've been trying to use rstrip like the following, to strip out the \n when i call the variable later, however it ends up giving me a variable such as v1 = ''.  Not sure how to embed code into this so ill put it on paste bin at: <a href="http://pastebin.com/GtVKqxur" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Link</a>  @Martijn Pieters</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2809413: yes, the newline is included. You can strip that off; <code>test1.rstrip('\n')</code> would remove any newlines from the end of the string, for example (returning the altered string).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, not really sure how to implement that? Where does the test1 come from?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2809413: You used <code>test1</code> as a variable in your question.</span>
