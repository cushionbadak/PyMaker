<p>I am running Python 2.7.3 and Django 1.5.8. I am trying to get “<em>It worked</em>” for a new install. I get <em>Error 324</em> from Chrome: </p>

<p>When I kill the server, I get the following traceback:</p>

<p>I read somewhere that this error had to do with Python 2.5.1 and was gone in 2.5.2. I can’t find that now. It must have been somewhere in code.djangoproject.com, but perhaps this is not the same issue.</p>
<p>I saw <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/880239/how-to-clear-the-port-when-restarting-django-runserver">How to 'clear' the port when restarting django runserver</a> where people said the server was already running, so I tried that solution: </p>
<pre><code>(fed1-venv)vagrant@precise64:/vagrant/fed1$ ps aux | grep -i manage
vagrant  10113  0.0  0.2  11676   940 pts/0    S+   14:57   0:00 grep --color=auto -i manage
</code></pre>
<p>And then tried bringing it to the foreground to kill but:</p>
<pre><code>(fed1-venv)vagrant@precise64:/vagrant/fed1$ fg
bash: fg: current: no such job
</code></pre>
<p>So that is not my problem, either.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8171955/django-strange-behavior-using-static-files">Django - Strange behavior using static files</a> has a similar error resolved with URL patterns – but I’m not there yet. I’m just trying to get ‘it worked’. Most of the people I see asking about this error have sites up and running in production already.</p>
<p>I looked at <code>socketserver.py</code> but I'm not advanced enough to interpret that. </p>

<p>Don't worry about the exception, you can safely ignore it. Your server has exited already, albeit a little messily.</p>
<p>On shut-down, Python cleans up global names to prevent circular dependencies from holding up finalisation. It does so by rebinding them no <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>You were shutting down the server with a Keyboard Interrupt (CTRL-C), triggering finalisation. In the meantime, the <code>serve_forever</code> thread was still running it's socket polling loop, but the <code>select</code> global in the <code>SocketServer</code> module had already been rebound. As a result the lookup for <code>select.select()</code> fails.</p>
<p>If this bothers you, upgrade to Python 3.4. This version no longer sets globals to <code>None</code> (in most cases), as per <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html#whatsnew-pep-442" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Safe Object Finalization</a>; see <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0442/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 442</a>.</p>
<p>As for your Chrome error code and your other question, <strong>something</strong> is already bound to the port you are trying to use for Django. That's an entirely separate issue from the exception you saw for the <code>select.select()</code> call. It could be that another piece of software is holding on to that port, something that doesn't respond to HTTP requests (leading to the Chrome error response). </p>
<p>See <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/9252/determining-what-process-is-bound-to-a-port">Determining what process is bound to a port</a> (Linux) or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4421633/who-is-listening-on-a-given-tcp-port-on-mac-os-x">Who is listening on a given TCP port on Mac OS X?</a> (Mac) to troubleshoot that issue.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I followed the link you gave for determining what process is bound to a port, ran netstat but there was nothing on either port 8000 or 8888.  I decided to try closing my VM and rebooting. This time when I ran runserver Chrome still says there is no response, but when I closed the server there was no error output from the console at all.  I guess that's good if it shows the select error is resolved, but I have no idea where to go next with the 'no response' issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">p.s. Maybe I should add/explain that 8888 is the port vagrant forwards to.</span>
