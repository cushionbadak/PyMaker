<p>I am trying to write a program that loops a prompt 10 times or until the correct input is entered. Wrong input entered should not count towards the 10 tries to enter the correct input.
 I am not sure if I should keep the prompt within the for statement or not. Here is what I have so far regarding the bad input issue:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    value=input("Enter a numerical value: ")
    if value.isdigit()==False:
       print("Error.")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A better construct to use would be a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/WhileLoop" rel="nofollow">while</a> loop.</p>
<p>Instead of looping for 10 times, you could loop until you have a valid input, i.e.</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    value = input("Enter a number:")
    if value.isdigit() == False:
        print "Error"
    else: 
        break
</code></pre>
<p>However, that said, if you only want to loop for a maximum of 10 times, the construct that you have is perfectly fine - you just need a way of exiting the loop when a valid number is entered,</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    value=input("Enter a numerical value: ")
    if value.isdigit()==False:
        print("Error.")
    else:#is a digit
        break
</code></pre>
<p>After seeing your comment, I would still advise using while loop, just with an extra variable (and a few changes made from DarinDouglass's comment</p>
<pre><code>times_correct = 0
while times_corrent &lt; 10:
    value = input("Enter a number:")
    if value.isdigit() == False:
        print "Error"
    else:
        times_corrent += 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#break" rel="nofollow">break the loop</a> when you get the correct input:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    value=input("Enter a numerical value: ")
    if not value.isdigit():  # PEP8 says to use `not` instead of `== False`
        print("Error.")
    else:
        break  # If we get here, the input was good.  So, break the loop.
</code></pre>
<p>See a demonstration below:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(10):
...     value=input("Enter a numerical value: ")
...     if not value.isdigit():
...         print("Error.")
...     else:
...         break
...
Enter a numerical value: a
Error.
Enter a numerical value: b
Error.
Enter a numerical value: 12
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, but I believe I phrased that poorly. I actually have several error checks, and if the user gives input that I deem incorrect, such as ifvalue.isdigit()==False, I want that user input to not count as an input for the 'for' statement. Basically, I want a user to be able to type in incorrect input indefinitely, but only able to type in correct inputs 10 times.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user, in that case, I would still recommend using a while loop -- see my edit</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is no need for an infinite loop here. Simply use <code>while time_correct &lt; 10</code>. Also, the <code>if value.isdigit() == False</code> is wordy, use <code>if not value.isdigit()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DarinDouglass - I am inclined to agree on the first point - it really does make more sense that way, however, I have not changed the value.isdigit == False - it seems easier to read that (at least to me) way even if it is wordier and more prone to error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">. I understand what I was doing wrong now, I should have used 'while' from the start because the statements are dependent on user input. Thank you so much, you really helped me out with something I was stuck on for hours.</span>
