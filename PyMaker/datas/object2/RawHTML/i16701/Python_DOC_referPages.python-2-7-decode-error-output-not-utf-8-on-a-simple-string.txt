<p>When I try the following code:</p>
<pre><code>a = "C:\Python27\777.xls"
print a
</code></pre>
<p>I get this error:</p>
<p><code>Decode error- output not utf-8</code></p>
<p>Although there are other questions which seem related, they mostly seem to be from people actually trying to encode something, whereas I am just trying to make sure my file path does not error out when I call it. </p>
<p>How can I fix it?</p>

<p>You need to escape your slashes:  write <code>\\</code> instead of just <code>\</code> when you want a backslash.</p>
<pre><code>a = "C:\\Python27\\777.xls"
print a
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could use a "raw string."  Whenever a string is a raw string, a slash i just a slash, and you don't have to worry about weird stuff happening.</p>
<pre><code>a = r"C:\Python27\777.xls"
print a
</code></pre>
<p>Right now, Python is interpreting the <code>\777</code> as a single character, with the octal value <code>777</code>, which does not exist.  So Python is puking.  Check out this link to the reference and scroll down a bit for the escape sequences in Python strings. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#strings" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#strings</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Works! However just in case someone runs into the problem i wanted to point out that if someone did: a = "C:\Python27\helloworld" print a, it would actually print a statement. Is it just better practice to perhaps 'always' use the backslash?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, it's always best practice to use the backslash (PS, this is called "escaping" the backslash).  You can also use what is called a "raw string", and that's just as good.  I'll update my answer to explain a raw string.</span>
