<p>I have the following problem. I have a german text saved in .txt UTF-8 format, and I'd like to  print it out with python. Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>txt = open(filename, 'r').read()
print txt.decode('utf-8-sig')
</code></pre>
<p>It works perfectly in IDLE, but when I save my code and run it from the command prompt, it raises error, specifically:</p>
<pre><code>UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode characters in position 3-4: cha
racter maps to &lt;undefined&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In my particular case, the text is "gemäßigt", and in the beginning of .py code I put something like</p>
<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8-sig -*-
</code></pre>
<p>By the way, my OS is Windows, in Russian. Does anybody have an idea what is my problem?</p>
<p>Best,
Alex</p>

<p>Your console uses the <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codepage_866" rel="nofollow">DOS codepage 866</a> which doesn't have the character symbols for <code>ä</code> or <code>ß</code>, causing the error.</p>
<p>You could try <code>.encoding('cp866', errors='replace')</code> your string before output, replacing all the characters not supported by your terminal by <code>?</code>s.</p>

<p>Is your text in UTF-8 or utf-8-sig ? It's not exaclty the same.
Here you can learn the difference.

<p>You can also open text file already decoded with</p>
<pre><code>import codecs
txt = codecs.open(filename,'r',"utf-8-sig").read()
</code></pre>
<p>I think Tim is correct about the console problem.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you get when you <code>import sys</code> and then <code>sys.stdout.encoding</code> in the console?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I get this 'cp866'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's your problem, that codepage doesn't support German special characters. What do you get when you try the above command in IDLE?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In IDLE I get exactly the same word</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Somehow, it does not work. I'll goolge later on again, and write down solution if I'll find some. Many thanks for your suggestions how to solve it!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe I was unclear; you first need to decode it from UTF-8, then encode that to cp866: <code>print txt.decode('utf-8-sig').encode('cp866', errors='replace')</code>. Did you try it that way?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, thanks, that kind of solved my problem!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Alekz112: if you don't need to output both latin and cyrillic characters, you can try changing the codepage (<code>chcp 850</code> at the DOS prompt, then <code>python.exe myscript.py</code>). That at least allows you to output words like "gemäßigt".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, I suspected console problem, I just can't figure out how to fix it</span>
