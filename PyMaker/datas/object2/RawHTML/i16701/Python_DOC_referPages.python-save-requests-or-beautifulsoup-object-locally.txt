<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have some code that is quite long, so it takes a long time to run.  I want to simply save either the requests object (in this case "name") or the BeautifulSoup object (in this case "soup") locally so that next time I can save time.  Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

url = 'SOMEURL'
name = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(name.content)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Since <code>name.content</code> is just <code>HTML</code>, you can just dump this to a file and read it back later. </p>
<p>Usually the bottleneck is not the parsing, but instead the network latency of making requests.</p>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

url = 'https://google.com'
name = requests.get(url)

with open("/tmp/A.html", "w") as f:
  f.write(name.content)


# read it back in
with open("/tmp/A.html") as f:
  soup = BeautifulSoup(f)
  # do something with soup
</code></pre>
<p>Here is some anecdotal evidence for the fact that bottleneck is in the network.</p>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import time

url = 'https://google.com'

t1 = time.clock();
name = requests.get(url)
t2 = time.clock();
soup = BeautifulSoup(name.content)
t3 = time.clock();

print t2 - t1, t3 - t2
</code></pre>
<p>Output, from running on Thinkpad X1 Carbon, with a fast campus network.</p>
<pre><code>0.11 0.02
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What about just saving <code>html</code> source code into the <code>html</code> files?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">FYI, you can replace <code>BeautifulSoup(f.read())</code> with just <code>BeautifulSoup(f)</code>.</span>
