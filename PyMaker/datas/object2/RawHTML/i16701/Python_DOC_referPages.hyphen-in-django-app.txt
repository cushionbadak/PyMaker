<p>Well I stumbled upon a problem with imports and a Django app that has a hyphen in its name.</p>
<p>As far as I know hyphens aren't even allowed in Django app names but it's still there and the website runs without errors. I have absoltuely no idea of how the app was created since the project already existed when I started working on it. (It's a Django CMS project if that changes anything btw)</p>
<p>Now the problem is that when I want to import something in the shell or in a project I can't just write <code>from my-app import module</code> since it always throws an error because of the hypen.</p>
<p>Also in the <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> it is listed with the hypen <code>INSTALLED_APPS = ('my-app')</code></p>
<p>So how can I actually fix this and make it useable? I thought about renaming but I don't really know the consequences and I also don't really want to break anything in the CMS (I'm still learning Django and the CMS is very new to me)</p>

<p>You can do this:</p>
<pre><code>import importlib
module = importlib.import_module('.module', 'my-app')
</code></pre>
<p>See documentation for more info <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module</a></p>
<p>Edit: This is not a Django specific issue, it is that in Python (and in most other programming languages) '-' (hyphen) can't be used in variable names (As '-' is the subtraction operator).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks a lot that worked like a charm. But I still don't get how it was even possible to create an app with a hyphen... Do you know how that could happen? The last time I tried to create one it threw out an error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jutschge, One can manually create package (wihtout using startapp command) and add it to installed app.</span>
