<p>I am receiving the error: ValueError: Wrong number of items passed 3, placement implies 1, and I am struggling to figure out where, and how I may begin addressing the problem.</p>
<p>I don't really understand the meaning of the error; which is making it difficult for me to troubleshoot. I have also included the block of code that is triggering the error in my Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>I have trouble to create a variable on dataframe according to many conditions. </p>
<p>I wish add a column with a binary variable 'Yes'/'No' according the answer at conditions. </p>
<p>My dataframe is build from CSV file with 11 columns. </p>
<p>I try this code : </p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

df['yes/no'] = np.where(df[(df['var_1'].isin(list)) &amp; (df['var2'] &gt;= '2000-01-01') &amp; (df['var_2'] &lt;= '2000-12-31') &amp; (df['var_3'] &gt;0) &amp; (df['var_4'] =='OK')],'yes','No')
</code></pre>
<p>I think the problem come from the creation of variable because the code is correct without the <code>np.where</code> condition. </p>
<p>But when i want create a variable with those conditions and execute the code it display the error : </p>
<pre><code>Wrong number of items passed 12, placement implies 1
</code></pre>
<p>Do you know what it means that error and how to fix that ? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><code>np.where</code> returns an array of the size only of the number of matches it finds. If you want to add a column to a your df you need a series the same size, with <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> depending on the condition. For this just use a bare condition:</p>
<pre><code>df['yes/no'] = 'No'
rows = (df['var_1'].isin(list)) &amp; 
    (df['var2'] &gt;= '2000-01-01') &amp; 
    (df['var_2'] &lt;= '2000-12-31') &amp; 
    (df['var_3'] &gt;0) &amp; 
     (df['var_4'] =='OK')
df.loc[rows, 'yes/no'] = 'yes'
</code></pre>
