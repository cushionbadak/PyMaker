<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a large document which I am trying to extract certain data from using Pythonv3. Text similar to the below is repeated and I want to extract the "123456789" and "987654321" each time the "pic=" and "originalName=" strings are identified.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"this is some text pic=123456789 some more text originalName="987654321.jpg then some more text"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can anyone assist?</p>

<p>You'll want to use python's library for <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expressions</a>. Regular expressions are a useful way to search for patterns in text. In this case, the other commenters have already provided a working snippet:</p>
<pre><code>import re
s= 'this is some text pic=123456789 some more text originalName="987654321.jpg then some more text'
data = re.findall('(?&lt;=pic\=)\d+|(?&lt;=originalName\=\")\d+', s)
</code></pre>
<p>This looks like nonsense at first, so here's a breakdown:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer">re.findall</a> returns all matches to the specified pattern in the specified string.</p>
<p>The first parameter to findall is the regular expression pattern, enclosed by single quotes. A regular expression can be just a word; <code>re.findall('apple', s)</code> would return all instances of the word "apple" in s. However, there are several characters with special <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">meaning</a> to help describe more general patterns.</p>
<p><code>\d</code> matches any digit 0-9. <code>\d+</code> matches a sequence of digits 0-9 of any length.</p>
<p>The <code>|</code> in the middle separates two regular expressions. If either pattern is matched, the overall expression returns a match.</p>
<p><code>(?&lt;= ... )</code> is called a positive lookbehind. This returns a match if there's a pattern that is <em>preceded</em> by the pattern described in the <code>...</code>. </p>
<p><code>=</code> and <code>"</code> have special meanings, so <code>\=</code> and <code>\"</code> specify that those characters are supposed to be used normally. </p>
<p>So <code>'(?&lt;=pic\=)\d+'</code> matches a sequence of digits of any length that is preceded by the string <code>pic=</code>. And <code>'(?&lt;=originalName\=\")\d+'</code>matches a sequence of digits preceded by the string <code>originalName="</code>.</p>
<p>The second parameter to findall is just the string to search for these patterns. So <code>re.findall('(?&lt;=pic\=)\d+|(?&lt;=originalName\=\")\d+', s)</code> will search s and return all sequences of digits with <code>pic=</code> before them, and all sequences of digits with <code>originalName="</code> before them.</p>

<p>You can try this:</p>
<pre><code>import re
s= 'this is some text pic=123456789 some more text originalName="987654321.jpg then some more text'
data = re.findall('(?&lt;=pic\=)\d+|(?&lt;=originalName\=\")\d+', s)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>['123456789', '987654321']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like you want regular expressions. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/re.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! Makes perfect sense. How do I add characters in there too? I just realised some of my originalNames also have letters. Thanks again</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Done it with \w+ thanks so much</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>data = re.findall('(?&lt;=pic\=)\d+|(?&lt;=originalName\=\")\d+', s)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd recommend you start putting more effort into your answers than "try this"... Do you not want OP to understand what they are running? They clearly have no experience with regex.</span>
