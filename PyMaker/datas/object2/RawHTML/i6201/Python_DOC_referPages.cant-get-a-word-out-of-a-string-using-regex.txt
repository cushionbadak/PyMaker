<p>I've created an expression using regex in python to get the first word out of a string. However, is there any way I could find any specific word as in, <code>PONY</code> in this case. As they both are four lettered words and the latter one is capital, i think it is possible to find <code>PONY</code> using regex. I could only make an expression for the first one, though!</p>
<p>What i tried to find the first word:</p>
<pre><code>import re

arg_str = "Jony is after PONY not phoney"
item = re.findall(r'([a-zA-Z]...+?)',arg_str)
print(item[0])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Any specific word? What about the following?</p>
<pre><code>words = re.findall(r" *\w+ *", arg_str)

for word in words:
    print(word)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Jony 
is 
after 
pony 
not 
phoney
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to find the first occurrence of a word in a string, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.find</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>arg_str = "Jony is after pony not phoney"
print(arg_str.find("pony"))
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to find the first word:</p>
<pre><code>print(arg_str.split()[0])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean? How can you describe the rule to get <code>pony</code>? <a href="https://ideone.com/xFGNtP" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>arg_str.split()[3]</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>(pony)</code> will help you find the exact word.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The regex for "specificword" is "specificword".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Sam Chats for your answer. Now I can get whichever I want using index. Btw, could you please make it a little bit easier for me by giving a oneliner explanation how you did? Forgive my ignorance. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Topto Space followed by a * means zero or more spaces, which surround \w+, which means more than one alphanumeric characters, or a word.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Sam Chats. +1 for this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">find will find a substring: ex: <code>epony</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><i>'Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found within the slice s[start:end]'</i></span>
