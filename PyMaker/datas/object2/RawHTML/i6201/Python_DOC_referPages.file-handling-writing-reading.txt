<p>I stumbled across an issue of file handling,

<p>That is the return value from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.write" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>write()</code></a> function in Python 3. The value is the number of characters written to the file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third Line gives an Error io.UnsupportedOperation: not readable</p>

<p>Not sure what you've done here. Following the <code>write()</code>, the file pointer is positioned at the end of the file. If you really opened the file with <code>w+</code> then you should not see an error, but 0 characters should be read from the file. If you opened the file with mode <code>w</code>, then you would get the <code>io.UnsupportedOperation</code> exception because the file is not opened for reading. Check which mode you used when you tested.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<pre><code>with open('Test.txt', 'w+') as c:
    n = c.write("Hey there")
    print('Wrote {} characters to file'.format(n))

    content = c.read()
    print('Read {} characters from file'.format(len(content)))
    print('{!r}'.format(content))

    _ = c.seek(0)    # move file pointer back to the start of the file
    content = c.read()
    print('After seeking to start, read {} characters from file'.format(len(content)))
    print('{!r}'.format(content))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre>
Wrote 9 characters to file
Read 0 characters from file
''
After seeking to start, read 9 characters from file
'Hey there'
</pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Result of line 2: what do the docs say <code>write()</code> returns? Error: what do the docs say <code>open(&lt;path&gt;, "w+")</code> does? Do you use an IDE? Does it show doc strings when you hover over a function name?</span>
