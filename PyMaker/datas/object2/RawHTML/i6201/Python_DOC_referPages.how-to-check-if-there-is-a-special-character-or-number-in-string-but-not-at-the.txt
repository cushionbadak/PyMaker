<p>Is it possible to check if a <code>string</code> contains special <code>characters</code> or <code>numbers</code> from this <code>string</code> of <code>characters</code>:</p>
<pre><code>"()1234567890!?_@#$%^&amp;*.,'"
</code></pre>
<p>But at the same time ignore all results where these special <code>characters</code> are at the <em>end</em> of the <code>string</code>?</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>"Hell,o" is False 
",.Hello" is False
"Whatc!hadoi66n" is False
"Hello," is True
"Hello,!'#" is True
</code></pre>

<p>You could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.rstrip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.rstrip</code></a> to remove all trailing special characters from the end of the string, and then check whether the resulting string and the special character set are disjoint.</p>
<pre><code>def f(string, special="()1234567890!?_@#$%^&amp;*.,'"):
    return {*string.rstrip(special)}.isdisjoint(special)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>In [5]: f("Hell,o")
Out[5]: False

In [6]: f("Hello!")
Out[6]: True

In [7]: f("Hello,!'#")
Out[7]: True

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This regexp:</p>
<pre><code>import re
re.match(r'[^()1234567890!?_@#$%^&amp;*.,']*[()1234567890!?_@#$%^&amp;*.,']*$', string)
</code></pre>
<p>The first part of the regexp requires the string to start with a sequence of characters that don't include the special characters. The second part matches a possibly empty sequence of special characters at the end.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What about this string: "abcdefgh1ij!" There are two special characters in the "end" of the string. What will be the result True or False?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I didn't notice that example that allows multiple special characters at the end. I've updated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi there, OP's question is not logically correct. What will be the result for this string: "abcdefgh1ij!"? It is clear that there are two special characters in the "end" of the string. Thank you! :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ElisByberi Only <code>!</code> is at the end of the string, <code>1</code> is in the middle. So it should be <code>false</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The text says "at the end", and the examples make it clear what he means by that. He doesn't mean just the last character, he means in a sequence at the end.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's why we ask people to provide examples, because it can be difficult to describe things in words.</span>
