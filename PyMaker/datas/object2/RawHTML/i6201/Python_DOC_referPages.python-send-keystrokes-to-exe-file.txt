<p>I need to send keystrokes to an exe using python. I can run the exe using python from subprocess as</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.Popen('myfile.exe',stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre>
<p>but how can I keep the connection and keep sending keys. I don't want to read back from the exe just to send some keystrokes any suggestions </p>

<p>Use <code>stdin=subprocess.PIPE</code> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.communicate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Popen.communicate()</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interact with process: Send data to stdin. Read data from stdout and
  stderr, until end-of-file is reached. Wait for process to terminate.
  The optional input argument should be data to be sent to the child
  process, or None, if no data should be sent to the child. If streams
  were opened in text mode, input must be a string. Otherwise, it must
  be bytes.</p>
<p>communicate() returns a tuple (stdout_data, stderr_data). The data
  will be strings if streams were opened in text mode; otherwise, bytes.</p>
<p>Note that if you want to send data to the processâ€™s stdin, you need to
  create the Popen object with stdin=PIPE. Similarly, to get anything
  other than None in the result tuple, you need to give stdout=PIPE
  and/or stderr=PIPE too.</p>
