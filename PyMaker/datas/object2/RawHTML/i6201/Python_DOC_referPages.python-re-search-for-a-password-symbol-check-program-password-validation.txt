<p>I'm making a program to check password strength. The password must have uppercase letters, lowercase letters, allowed symbols and numbers. I have been able to get the rest of the program to work(useing the re.search(r'[a-z],password  structure) I shortened the problem area to these few lines but cannot get this part to work. Should I be using something different to re.search?</p>
<pre><code>    import re
    symbols = ["!","(",")","£","^"]
    password = input("password")
    if re.search(r'[symbols]',password):
      print("ok")
    else:
      print("no")
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You're almost there. Just specify all your symbols inside the regex range:</p>
<pre><code>password_valid = bool(re.search(r'[!()£^]', password))
</code></pre>
<p>Inside <code>[..]</code> most regex metacharacters <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lose their special meaning</a>, just watch out for the <code>^</code> in the first position and for the character classes, like <code>\w</code>.</p>
<p>If you take care to prevent those cases, you can keep symbols in the list, and use it like:</p>
<pre><code>symbols = ["!", "(", ")", "£", "^"]
password_valid = bool(re.search(r'[{}]'.format(''.join(symbols)), password))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't just expect random names to get interpolated into your string. Try something like <code>'[{}]'.format(symbols)</code>.</span>
