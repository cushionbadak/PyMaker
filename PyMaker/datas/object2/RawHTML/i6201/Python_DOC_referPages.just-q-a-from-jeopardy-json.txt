<p>I downloaded this 200k Q/A of Jeopardy questions. I thought it would be fun to plug into some trivia bot. Anyhow, it's 50M in size with no line breaks that I can see.</p>
<p>I just want to pull all of the questions and answers from this monster into a file format like:</p>
<pre><code>-- question
 - answer
</code></pre>
<p>Here's part of what the file looks like. I know that I can't go line by line and I know I can't load the entire thing into memory. But, I also know that what I want is the first thing in quotes after <code>"question":</code> and the answer is the first thing in quotes directly after <code>"answer":</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[{"category": "HISTORY", "air_date": "2004-12-31", "question": "'For the last 8 years of his life, Galileo was under house arrest for espousing this man's theory'", "value": "$200", "answer": "Copernicus", "round": "Jeopardy!", "show_number": "4680"},
 {"category": "ESPN's TOP 10 ALL-TIME ATHLETES", "air_date": "2004-12-31", "question": "'No. 2: 1912 Olympian; football star at Carlisle Indian School; 6 MLB seasons with the Reds, Giants &amp; Braves'", "value": "$200", "answer": "Jim Thorpe", "round": "Jeopardy!", "show_number": "4680"},
 {"category": "EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT IT...", "air_date": "2004-12-31", "question": "'The city of Yuma in this state has a record average of 4,055 hours of sunshine each year'", "value": "$200", "answer": "Arizona", "round": "Jeopardy!", "show_number": "4680"},

<p>For each dictionary in the list, get the <code>'question'</code> and <code>'answer'</code> keys:</p>
<pre><code>for l in d:
    print l['question'], l['answer']

<pre><code>'For the last 8 years of his life, Galileo was under house arrest for espousing this man's theory' Copernicus
'No. 2: 1912 Olympian; football star at Carlisle Indian School; 6 MLB seasons with the Reds, Giants &amp; Braves' Jim Thorpe

<span class="comment-copy">It's a list of dictionaries, do you have any code you've tried yet?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Like @JonathanPorter said, it's a list of dictionaries, creating a basic python programme to read the file and sort them into a format that you want shouldn't be too hard although it's hard to see what you're actually asking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why can't you load a 50M file directly into memory?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As downshift suggests, 50M isn't that big. If it's valid JSON the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json</code></a> module will easily read it for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just thought it would take forever, like it was a txt file. Thanks for the help guys.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks to all for the help. I didn't know that json files were something awesome. Thanks again!</span>
