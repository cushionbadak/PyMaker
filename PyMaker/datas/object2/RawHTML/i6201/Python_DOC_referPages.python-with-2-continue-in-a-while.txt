<p>I tried exception handling and got stuck in my first program, in this program my first continue in while is working but 2nd one is not continuing the loop</p>
<pre><code>print("hello to divide")
o = "y"
while o == "y":
    try:
        x = int(input("enter first no. = "))
        y = int(input("enter second no. = "))
    except:
        print("please enter numeric value")
        continue
    try:
        z = x/y
        print(str(x) +"/"+str(y)+"="+str(z))
    except:
        print("please do not divide with 0(zero)")
        continue

    finally:
        o = input("do you want to do it again (y/n)? = ")
</code></pre>
<p>The second except is working fine but after printing message it jumps to finally statement </p>
<p>please help ???</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#defining-clean-up-actions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>finally clause</em> is always executed before leaving the <code>try</code>
  statement, whether an exception has occurred or not. When an exception
  has occurred in the <code>try</code> clause and has not been handled by an
  <code>except</code> clause (or it has occurred in an <code>except</code> or <code>else</code> clause),
  it is re-raised after the <code>finally</code> clause has been executed. The
  <code>finally</code> clause is also executed “on the way out” when any other
  clause of the try statement is left via a <strong><code>break</code>, <code>continue</code> or
  <code>return</code></strong> statement. A more complicated example:</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure you just want:</p>
<pre><code>print("hello to divide")
o = "y"
while o == "y":
    try:
        x = int(input("enter first no. = "))
        y = int(input("enter second no. = "))
    except:
        print("please enter numeric value")
        continue
    try:
        z = x/y
        print(str(x) +"/"+str(y)+"="+str(z))
    except:
        print("please do not divide with 0(zero)")
        continue

    o = input("do you want to do it again (y/n)? = ")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried formatting your code, but you should make sure it accurately reflects what you actually have.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why are you using continue ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, because <code>finally</code> is <i>always</i> executed. That's the whole point.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you very much i'll make sure it wont happen again  @juanpa.arrivillaga</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i m using continue so the while loop would again execute and before finally would execute</span>
