<p>I am trying to get started with <code>Python</code> Web Programming with <code>Django</code>, so I installed <code>pip</code> first (via <code>HomeBrew</code>) and now the latest version of <code>Django</code>, but the following happens, which I have no idea what is wrong or what I should do next. Could someone please help me understand what is going on + what I need to do + what commands I should issue to resolve this, etc...?</p>
<pre><code>$ pip --version
pip 9.0.1 from /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-9.0.1-py2.7.egg (python 2.7)

<p>This is probably because your user account doesn't have some permissions regarding the <code>Library</code> folder.</p>
<p>Use </p>
<pre><code>sudo pip install Django==1.11.7
</code></pre>
<h2>Alternative way</h2>
<p>You might also use </p>
<pre><code>pip install --user Django
</code></pre>
<p>which installs Django following the user installation scheme. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/install/index.html#inst-alt-install-user" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This</a> page says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This scheme is designed to be the most convenient solution for users that <strong>don’t have write permission to the global site-packages directory</strong> or don’t want to install into it... Files will be installed into subdirectories of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site.USER_BASE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">site.USER_BASE</a>.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, I think that what you are doing isn't considered best practices.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You would have to use <code>sudo</code> to install into <code>site-packages</code>. However, that's not the recommended approach. It would be much better to use a virtualenv, and to use Python 3 (Django 1.11.x is the very last version to support Python 2). The Django Girls Tutorial is a good guide. See the <a href="https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_installation/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python installation</a> and <a href="https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_installation/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Django installation</a> sections. If you wish, you can use brew to install Python 3 instead of downloading the installer.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much indeed.  I added <code>sudo</code> and finally got the message: <code>Successfully installed Django-1.11.7</code> One question though: What happens if I do <code>pip install --user Django</code> now (just like that, without mentioning version) after what I have already done with the sudo command?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I <b>guess</b> that it will install Django another time but this time in <code>~/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages</code> according to the links in the answer, and assuming that you have a framework build of Python.</span>
