<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In my Python code, I have :</p>
<p>from vmtk import vmtkscripts</p>
<p>The program has no issue finding "vmtkscripts.py". 
However, in vmtkscripts.py I have "</p>
<p><code>__all__ = ['vmtkactivetubes']</code></p>
<pre><code>for item in __all__:
    exec('from '+item+' import *')
</code></pre>
<p>where "vmtkactivetubes.py" is in the same folder as "vmtkscripts.py". </p>
<p>After running I get "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vmtkactivetubes'"
However, this "from vmtk import vmtkactivetubes" doesn't give me any error.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate if you could help me, why I get such a error?</p>

<p>This is a problem of scope, </p>
<p>try using:</p>
<pre><code>exec('from '+item+' import *', globals())
</code></pre>
<p>This from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In all cases, if the optional parts are omitted, the code is executed
  in the current scope. If only globals is provided, it must be a
  dictionary, which will be used for both the global and the local
  variables. If globals and locals are given, they are used for the
  global and local variables, respectively. If provided, locals can be
  any mapping object. Remember that at module level, globals and locals
  are the same dictionary. If exec gets two separate objects as globals
  and locals, the code will be executed as if it were embedded in a
  class definition.</p>
