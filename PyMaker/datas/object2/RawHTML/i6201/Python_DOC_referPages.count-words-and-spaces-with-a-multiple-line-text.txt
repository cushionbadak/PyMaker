<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I need to count the number of words and the number of spaces of the text indicated below through defining a function in Python. I tried with the <code>split(" ")</code> command but due to the text are in two different lines I don't know how to do it. Can somebody help me?</p>
<p><code>text1 = "A sentence is a group of words that makes complete sense, \n
 contains a main verb, and begins with a capital letter."</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try the following</p>
<p>words</p>
<pre><code>print len(text1.replace('\\', '').split())
</code></pre>
<p>spaces</p>
<pre><code>print text1.count(' ')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Another way to count the number of words it's the following:</p>
<p>print len(text1.split())</p>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">@ChristianDean there's no newline in the example...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChristianDean <code>'1\n3 2'.split()</code> results in <code>['1', '3', '2']</code>. Am I missing something here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@alfasin Yes, I realize that. I was just going of what the OP said.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also see the string method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>splitlines()</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">err, the backslash replacement is a remnant of the old version of the question. It's not useful anymore.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your help. Nevertheless, in the case to count the spaces, it is not necessary to specify Python not to count spaces in the first line just after \n?  Thanks in advance</span>
