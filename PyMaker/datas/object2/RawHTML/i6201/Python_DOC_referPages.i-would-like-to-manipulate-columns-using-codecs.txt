<p>I am trying to extract information from a compressed file. 
I used this code:</p>
<pre><code>import codecs
!gunzip pagecounts-20150501-000000.gz
log = codecs.open('pagecounts-20150501-000000', 'r')
lines = log.readlines(1)
print(lines)
</code></pre>
<p>However it gives me only the first letter in the file.  The file has actually 4 columns, but I would like to store the first two columns using a dataframe or any other structure for massive data (almost 186328237 lines).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You're only asking for the first character in the first line:</p>
<pre><code>lines = log.readlines(1)
</code></pre>
<p>You're only passing a '1' to <code>readlines</code>' <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html?highlight=readlines#codecs.StreamReader.read" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>read()</code> method</a> - if you want to read more than that, change that value, or you could use the <code>readline()</code> method to read a single line at a time. </p>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html?highlight=readlines#codecs.StreamReader.readlines" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>readlines</strong>([<em>sizehint</em>[, <em>keepends</em>]]) Read all lines available on the
  input stream and return them as a list of lines.</p>
<p>Line-endings are implemented using the codec’s decoder method and are
  included in the list entries if keepends is true.</p>
<p><em>sizehint</em>, if given, is passed as the size argument to the stream’s
  read() method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To read the first line, try:</p>
<pre><code>lines = log.readline()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I have tried using readline(1) instead of readlines(1):                                        *readline(1) gives mes back the first letter of the file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How many letters are in the first line of the file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are 99 letters in the first line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">NB passing 1 to <code>readline()</code> is passing the same size argument to <code>read()</code> as <code>readlines()</code> does - read the docs link.</span>
