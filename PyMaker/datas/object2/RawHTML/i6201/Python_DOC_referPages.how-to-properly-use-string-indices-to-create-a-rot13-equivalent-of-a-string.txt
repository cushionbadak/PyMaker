<p>For my programming class, we have to create a function that takes in a string argument and returns the rot13 equivalent of the string. When I try running my function, it says that count can't equal str[i] because string indices have to be integers. I'm honestly lost and what else I could do to make the function work. Any help would be lovely    </p>
<pre><code>def str_rot_13(str):
     new_list = []
     for i in str:
         if ord(i) &lt;= 77:
             count = str[i]
             k = chr(ord(count) + 13)
             new_list.append(k)
         if ord(i) &gt; 77 and ord(i) &lt;= 90:
             count = str[i]
             k = ord(count) - 78
             new_list.append(chr(65 + k))
     return new_list
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code> for i in str:
     if ord(i) &lt;= 77:
         count = str[i]
         k = chr(ord(count) + 13)
</code></pre>
<p>In Python, <code>for i in str</code> will loop through every character in the string <code>str</code>, with <code>i</code> set to that character (which you already know, since you're doing <code>ord(i)</code>). (Don't use <code>str</code> as a name, by the way: <code>str</code> is the Python name for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str#textseq" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the string type</a>.) <code>count = str[i]</code> is treating the character in <code>i</code> as an index. You don't need to (or should) do that. It doesn't make much sense.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the purpose of <code>count = str[i]</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@gommb To me, I think it makes it so that the function will go through every part of the string that I enter. Is this not a correct way to go through the string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the <code>for i in str:</code> will make it go through every character in str.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just remove <code>count = str[i]</code> and replace wherever you use <code>count</code> with <code>i</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@gommb it's working now, appreciate it!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok, i fixed it and it seems to be working now. Thanks</span>
