<p>This a 2-question rolled into 1 - I get the following output from the script next</p>

<p>The questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>How can I make the function checker() accessible only to other functions in this class (limit the scope)?</p></li>
<li><p>How do I synchronize for multiple threads ("4 - Bye for now" is an error, counter should be reset when message is set to new value).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially, I am looking for a replacement of "synchronized private void" from another language. Thank you for your help.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>1 - you dont. Scope of methods and variables is most of the time handled by programming conventions. In this case you would add a underline in the beggining of the checker to identify it as a private method that should only be called by the other methods inside the class.
2 - to synchronize multiple threads you need to work with the the threads using threading specific commands, trying to use the "carry_on" like you did will make you end in some weird alleys.
Ps: if I recall there is the @Async and @Sync annotations, you could look further into it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you can use <b>underscores</b> to make a variable or method private.at least one for <code>variables</code> (_somevar) and at least two for <code>methods</code> (__someMethod).see here =&gt; <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python doesn't really have private attributes or methods. You can use a <i>single</i> leading underscore to mark an attribute or method private, but that's merely a convention, Python doesn't enforce any conditions on such objects. The slogan is "We're all consenting adults here".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@shotgunner I don't know where you learned that, but it's not correct. Please see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1301346/what-is-the-meaning-of-a-single-and-a-double-underscore-before-an-object-name">What is the meaning of a single- and a double-underscore before an object name?</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring oops, you're right.I've got mistake</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are various tools to assist in synchronization available in the <code>threading</code> module. You could probably use a simple <code>Lock</code> or <code>Event</code> for this task. Also note that in recent versions of Python there are more modern alternatives to the threading module. Please see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">asyncio</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. "You cannot do this" is a perfectly valid answer :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python is very permissive, so we depend heavily in good pratices and conventios, pep, etc</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Messing around with my code and reading up stuff here - I figured that changing the method name from checker to __checker solves 1 problem (makes it private) - with the error: "AttributeError: 'CheckTscope' object has no attribute '__checker'".</span>
