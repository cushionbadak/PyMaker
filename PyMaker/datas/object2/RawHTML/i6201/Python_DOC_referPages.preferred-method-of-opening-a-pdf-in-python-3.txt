<p>Is there a newer way to open a PDF using an external viewer from Python 3 in Linux other than <code>subprocess</code>?</p>
<p>This sounds like a noobish and duplicate question, but I looked at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1679798/how-to-open-a-file-with-the-standard-application">this question</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19453338/opening-pdf-file">this question</a>, and all of the answers are over 7 years old and recommended discouraged methods like <code>os.system</code>, old methods like manually creating a <code>subprocess.Popen</code> or Windows-only methods like <code>os.startfile</code>.</p>
<p>So in the time since these questions were answered, have preferred methods of launching a PDF reader from within Python emerged, or are these still the best answers?</p>

<p>Python as of 3.6 still doesn't have a cross-platform way to open files using default programs.<br/>
<a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue3177" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Issue 3177</a> suggested to add one, but it didn't happen yet.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows, there's a system call for this, you can reach it from Python via <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.startfile" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.startfile</code></a>,</li>
<li>On Linux, there's a command-line tool called <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/xdg-open" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>xdg-open</code></a> that does this,</li>
<li>On Mac OS, there's a command-line tool simply called <code>open</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that unfortunately you still need to check the operating system and pick the right approach. The correct way to call the command-line tools is using the <code>subprocess</code> module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I will suggest using this guide that I followed a while back <a href="https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-work-with-pdf-documents-using-python--cms-25726" rel="nofollow noreferrer">code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@theBrainyGeek thanks, clarified my question. I'm looking for something that will open an external viewer, like Evince</span>

<span class="comment-copy">So: nope, these are still the best answers, windows still provides a system call accessible as <code>os.startfile</code>, linux still provides a command line tool <code>xdg-open</code> and mac still provides <code>open</code>, you still need to use subprocess with these, and <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue3177" rel="nofollow noreferrer">there's still no standard Python utility</a> to choose the correct tool for your particular OS.</span>
