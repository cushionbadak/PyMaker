<p>I currently have a <a href="https://github.com/Patlol/Handy-Install-Web-Server-ruTorrent-" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bash script</a> that installs a web server with many options and features.
Currently I download the script on the remote linux server and execute it via ssh.</p>
<p>This script uses Dialog so that the end user can enter information such as user name, password to create. Path to use, domain name etc....</p>
<p>I would like to rewrite this script which has become huge in python, keeping an interactivity of the same type (dialog). Is there a solution / module with python? Knowing that the remote server on which the script run is a server without a graphical system like Qt, Gtk just console. I think it is necessary to use curses<br/>
bash dialog definition : </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dialog is a utility to create nice user interfaces to shell scripts,
  or other scripting languages, such as perl. It is non-graphical (it
  uses curses) so it can be run in the console or an xterm.  </p>

<p>I'm looking for an equivalent on python
Thanks</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are several different ways to create dialog box type UIs for python. <a href="https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PyQt</a> is one of the more powerful ones. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Tkinter</a> is also handy for simple tasks. Or at least I like to use it for simple stuff. Either one should get what you need. There's probably more I missed as well. </p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>If it's a CLI you want, there are plenty of tool. <a href="http://click.pocoo.org/6/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here's a neat looking one.</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'd suggest you read about <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Flask</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you asking if there is a way to create dialog boxes in python, or is there a handy way to install/setup web server with python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">way to create dialog boxes or equivalent in python</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@patol. Sounds like you want <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pythondialog/3.4.0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pythondialog</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes but a linux server don't have windows manager. I use in my bash script "dialog" is not a graphic UI</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah I misunderstood. The python is running on the linux machine? And you want a command line interface?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes a command line interface, without a graphical system like Qt, Gtk just console.</span>
