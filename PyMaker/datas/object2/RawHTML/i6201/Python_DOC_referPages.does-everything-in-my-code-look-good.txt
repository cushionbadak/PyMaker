<p>Anything I could improve on?? I am a python beginner. Is there anything I could do to make my code look cleaner or just make it look more professional? Thanks</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    print('What password will you be storing?')
    PassChoice = input()
    print('What is your username or email for this account?')
    UserOrEmail = input()
    print("What is the password for " + str(PassChoice) + '?')
    Password = input()
    print('Your password for ' + str(PassChoice) + ' has been stored.')
    WebsiteAndPassword = (str(PassChoice) + '| ' + str(UserOrEmail) +': ' + 
str(Password) + '\n')
    break

PasswordFile = open('importantpasswords.txt', 'a')
PasswordFile.write(str(WebsiteAndPassword))
PasswordFile.close()

<p>Personally, I would use the getpass <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html</a> library when getting a users password and also you could have simplified it by doing:</p>
<pre><code>passChoice = input("What password will you be storing?")
</code></pre>
<p>or with getpass:</p>
<pre><code>import getpass

getpass.getpass(prompt="What password will you be storing?")
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this site is not for code review, but since you're new there is something that is really obvious:</p>
<pre><code>    PassChoice = input('What password will you be storing?')
    UserOrEmail = input('What is your username or email for this account?')
    Password = input('What is the password for ' + PassChoice + '?')
</code></pre>
<p>When you want to ask the user for an input, you can give your string as a parameter to the input function. Also, you don't have to cast <code>PassChoice</code> to string since it is the type that <code>input()</code> returns. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Some obviousthings: adhere to community-accepted standards (PEP-8 for example) and don't store passwords in a plain text file ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Voting to close question as opinion based</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would say more like too broad, this not about opinions</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should avoid giving "passwords" in plaintext input fields anyway</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, that is for sure, he was asking on how to improve his code. I hope this is for educational purposes. Storing real passwords in text files would be silly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you all for the useful info. I was also thinking it was stupid, but I just don't know any other way of doing it. Any ideas?</span>
