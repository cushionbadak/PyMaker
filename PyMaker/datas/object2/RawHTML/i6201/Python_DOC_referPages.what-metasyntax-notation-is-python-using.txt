<p>Full grammar specification for Python 3.6.3 is as follows: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html</a></p>
<p>It looks like EBNF appended by some special constructs taken from regular expressions, for example: <code>()*</code> (repeat zero or more times?) and <code>()+</code> (repeat one or more times?).</p>
<p>What metasyntax is Python using and where its specification can be found?</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Python's grammar is defined in this <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Grammar/Grammar" rel="nofollow noreferrer">file</a> (thanks @larsks). However, the question still stands - what notation is used?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The Python grammar is parsed by the parser in the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Parser" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Parser</a> directory of the source.  You can see this in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Makefile.pre.in#L779" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Makefile.pre</a>.  This generates <code>Include/graminit.[ch]</code>, which are used in, e.g., <code>Python/ast.c</code> as well as <code>Modules/parsermodule.c</code>.</p>
<p>The format of the grammar is described at the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Parser/pgen.c#L701" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bottom of pgen.c</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Input is a grammar in extended BNF (using * for repetition, + for
  at-least-once repetition, [] for optional parts, | for alternatives and
  () for grouping).</p>
</blockquote>

<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't use that grammar to generate its parser. The actuall grammar is in ASDL format in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Parser/Python.asdl" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python.asdl</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So why is it even there? I assumed if it's not what is actually used by CPython it's at least equivalent.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kindall: That's the definition of the AST structure, not the grammar.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the info on the source file, that's very useful. However, we still don't know what notation is used  exactly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've updated the answer to include the comments from parser, which hopefully answer that question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@siegmeyer: it's an idiosyncratic and loosely documented format without a formal specification, created specifically for parsing python by the python development team. The only unambiguous and definitive description is the pgen program which interprets it and creates the cpython parser.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was trying to avoid saying "the notation used is the notation supported by pgen", but @rici said it :).  Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, okay, this clears it up. Thank you both.</span>
