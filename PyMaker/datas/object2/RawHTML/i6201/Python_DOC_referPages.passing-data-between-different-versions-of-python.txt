<p>But I have two different versions of Python running (2.x and 3.x). We use 2.x in my shop, but are running 3.x on a virtual machine for machine learning libraries that 2.x doesn't support.</p>
<p>Will this solution work for 2.x and 3.x, or is there another method?</p>

<p>Well the 2 versions of python are different. At some time it will remain only python 3. Python 3 is upgraded version of python 2 but incompatible because it has new methods and functions calls. Here is an more detailed explanation by Python development team <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Porting python code</a>.</p>
<p>Here I even find a book to help you better

<span class="comment-copy">Oh I meant try with a trivial script? Maybe you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pickle</a>? <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1849523/is-pickle-file-of-python-cross-platform" title="is pickle file of python cross platform">stackoverflow.com/questions/1849523/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">what is the relation between the scripts? does one call another? to they need interactive communication, or one way?</span>
