<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have two lists:</p>
<pre><code>items_on_queue = ['The rose is red and blue', 'The sun is yellow and round']
things_to_tweet = ['The rose is red','The sun is yellow','Playmobil is a toy']
</code></pre>
<p>I want to find out if an element is present on both lists based on the FEW CHARACTERS AT THE BEGINNING, and delete the element from things_to_tweet if a match is found.</p>
<p>The final output should be things_to_tweet = ['Playmobil is a toy']</p>
<p>Any idea how I can do this?
Thank you</p>
<p>PS/ I tried, but I cannot do an "==" comparison because each el is different in every list, even if they start the same, so they're not seen as equal by Python.
I also tried a loop inside a loop but I don't know how to compare one element with ALL the elements of another list only IF the strings start in the same manner.
I also checked other SO threads but they seem to refer to comparisons between lists when elements are exactly the same, which is not what I need.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To keep things simple and readable, I would make use of a helper function (I named it <code>is_prefix_of_any</code>). Without this function we would have two nested loops, which is needlessly confusing. Checking whether a string is a prefix of another string is done with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.startswith</a> function.</p>
<p>I also opted to create a new list instead of removing strings from <code>things_to_tweet</code>, because removing things from a list you're iterating over will often cause unexpected results.</p>
<pre><code># define a helper function that checks if any string in a list
# starts with another string
# we will use this to check if any string in items_on_queue starts
# with a string from things_to_tweet
def is_prefix_of_any(prefix, strings):
    for string in strings:
        if string.startswith(prefix):
            return True
    return False

# build a new list containing only the strings we want
things = []
for thing in things_to_tweet:
    if not is_prefix_of_any(thing, items_on_queue):
        things.append(thing)

print(things) # output: ['Playmobil is a toy']
</code></pre>
<p>A veteran would do this with much less code, but this should be a lot easier to understand.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@COLDSPEED - Thanks for the correction</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I already tried that but did not work either. I think I don't know how exactly to apply it. Could you give me how you'd do it exactly? I think I'd learn more from that than wasting more time trying to do it. I've been already 2h around this.</span>
