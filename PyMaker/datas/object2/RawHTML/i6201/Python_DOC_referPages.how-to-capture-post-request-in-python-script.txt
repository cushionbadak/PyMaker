<p>I'm making an application which sends an <code>POST</code> request using ajax to a python script. I'm new to python and doesn't know much about it. 
As in PHP we do something like this to get a value from post request.</p>
<pre><code>$val = $_POST['data'];
</code></pre>
<p>How to do this in python? any help would be appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p>You can get that using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/cgi.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">raw cgi</a></p>
<p>For example: </p>
<pre><code>import cgi
form = cgi.FieldStorage()
print form["username"]
</code></pre>
<p>Everything is explained really well <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/464040/how-are-post-and-get-variables-handled-in-python">here</a></p>
