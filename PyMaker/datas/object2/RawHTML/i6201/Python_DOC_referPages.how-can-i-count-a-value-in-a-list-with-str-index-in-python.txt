<p>how can I count '2' in this dict?</p>
<pre><code>{'count': 2, 0: '1', 1: '2'}
</code></pre>
<p>Is there any built-in function?</p>
</div>

<p>First, it is a <code>dict</code>, not a <code>list</code>. You can use <code>sum</code> with a generator:</p>
<pre><code>d = {'count': 2, 0: '1', 1: '2'}
s = sum(v == 2 for v in d.values())
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to catch both <code>2</code> (the integer) and <code>'2'</code> (the string):</p>
<pre><code>s = sum(v in ('2', 2) for v in d.values())
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't know if it matters to your question, but that's a dictionary, not a list.  Generally for counting stuff you would use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Counter</code></a>, but your question doesn't really make it clear what it is you're trying to count</span>
