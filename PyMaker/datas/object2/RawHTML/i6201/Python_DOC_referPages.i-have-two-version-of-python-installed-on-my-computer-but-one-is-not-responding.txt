<p>I have two version of python installed on my computer one is <code>3.6.0</code> <strong>Anaconda</strong> and another one is <code>3.6.3</code>. Now on 3.6.3 I can not run or import any library like <code>pandas</code> or <code>numpy</code> on IDLE. I use windows 10. I can work on 3.6 version [Anaconda]. I tried to change the version through command prompt by <code>py -3</code> but since both the version are in 3 + so it didn't work.</p>

<p>Remove the Anaconda Python <code>3.6.0</code> python path from your <code>PATH</code> environment variables.<br/>
Instead, add the Python <code>3.6.3</code> path to your <code>PATH</code> variable.</p>
<p>Now use your normal command prompt for Python <code>3.6.3</code> version.<br/>
Use the command <code>activate root</code> in command prompt When you need Python <code>3.6.0</code> version.</p>

<p>If you have two versions of Python 3 on the same machine you should use virtual environments.</p>
<p>This will keep them separate and allow you to use the one you want and install the modules you want on that version.</p>
<p>You can learn to do this here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">The OP is saying they <i>already have</i> two separate interpreters -- this is a distinct situation from <i>wanting to have</i> two separate sets of installed libraries backed by the same interpreter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know, but if they create virtual environments they can use one from each interpreter, the same way you have a venv for py2 and one for py3</span>
