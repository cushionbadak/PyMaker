<p>I have written the following program and it works as expected however I would like the user to input something
This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>from fractions import Fraction
from math import log10

def maxnum(x):
    return ''.join(str(n) for n in sorted(x, reverse=True,
                          key=lambda i: Fraction(i, 10**(int(log10(i))+1)-1)))

for numbers in [(1, 34, 3, 98, 9, 76, 45, 4), (54, 546, 548, 60)]:
    print('Numbers: %r\n  Largest integer: %15s' % (numbers, maxnum(numbers)))
</code></pre>
<p>I would like it to print out "enter the numbers" user inputs the numbers he would like to concatenate into a larger number and then the program outputs it in the same way as the code above.
How do I do that
Thanks in advance</p>
