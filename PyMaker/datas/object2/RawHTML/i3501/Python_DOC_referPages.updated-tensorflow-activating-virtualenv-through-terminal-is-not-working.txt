<p>macOS High Sierra 10.13.2 â€” MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2016)<br/>
Trying to set up Python TensorFlow NOT because I like Python (hate it) but because that was what was recommended <br/>
NOTE: Not very experienced with Terminals and whatnot, but an okay programmer.</p>
<p>NEW PROBLEMS:
<br/> My computer seemed to have downloaded TensorFlow, but when following the steps to test it, this showed up: <br/>
<code>Macbook:~ rose$ cd Desktop
Macbook:Desktop rose$ Python
Python 2.7.10 (default, Jul 15 2017, 17:16:57) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.31)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
import tensorflow as tf
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ImportError: No module named tensorflow</code></p>
<p>EVERYTHING seemed fine when I finished the steps for installation...</p>
<p>So, I was thinking today that it would be pretty awesome to see if I could figure out how to set up some sort of neural network programming environment on my computer and eventually found TensorFlow. Everything was going pretty well, I was just <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_mac" rel="nofollow noreferrer">following the instructions on this page at the official site</a> for instructions. I installed pip, Virtualenv, nose/tornado (said I needed them, created a Virtualenv environment for Python 3.n, which I updated to today, then got to this step:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Activate the Virtualenv environment by issuing one of the following  commands:
  <br/><code>$ cd targetDirectory</code>
<br/><code>$ source ./bin/activate      # If using bash, sh, ksh, or zsh</code>
<br/> <code>$ source ./bin/activate.csh  # If using csh or tcsh</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used the command it said to use for bash (wow, these names are horrible and nondescript), but I'm not 100% sure I use bash, almost certain because that is supposed to be the default on Mac and got this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Input: 
  <code>Macbook:~ rose$ source ./bin/activate</code>
<br/> Error Message Output:
  <code>-bash: ./bin/activate: No such file or directory</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>NOTE: There were some other messages, here are screens of the whole shell.</p>
<p><a href="https://nintendo8.github.io/Screenshots/Screenshots.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Screenshots on my GitHub Pages</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You haven't created a virtual environment. There were errors. Please reread carefully your own screenshots, last but one and the last.</p>
<p>Cannot copy/paste the error message here from the images. That's one of many reasons why images without text are bad.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">when creating your virtual env you shoudl do th following: virtualenv tf_env --system-site-packages -p /usr/local/bin/python3  ... as yuo can see your's screenshots does miss the name for the environment and I just provided as a sample " tf_env "</span>
<span class="comment-copy">than activate the environment with source tf_env/bin/activate   here is the documentation for python3 but should work for your python2.7 version the documentation.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">so you need that folder named "tf_env" that I call "the name" of the environment but is actually a folder that will contain executable python files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, when I try to install it it says</span>
<span class="comment-copy">New problem: I did this so I could activate the (I think) now-downloaded Virtualenv environment <code>cd rose/tensorflow</code> and got this: <code>-bash: cd: rose/tensorflow: No such file or directory</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Things is, that folder exists</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Works fine now! Did this, worked this time: <code>Macbook:~ rose$ cd rose/tensorflow Macbook:tensorflow rose$ source ./bin/activate</code> and got <code>(tensorflow) Macbook:tensorflow rose$</code> as my prompt, which was supposed to happen</span>
