<p>So I am trying to set a class with attributes that also have attributes in Python 3. Something similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>ClassNo1.attr1.attr2.attr3 = 'somedatahere'
</code></pre>
<p>How can I do this in Python. I know that in Matlab you can do this by simply creating a struct but not sure how Python might do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python doesn't have the equivalent of matlab structs. To achieve the behavior you desire, you need to have attr1 be an instance of a class which has a property named attr2. attr2, similarly, must be an instance of a class which has a property named attr3. </p>
<p>You can find Python class definition syntax here:
