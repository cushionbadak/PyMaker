myList = eval(myString)
print(type(myList))    # &lt;class 'list'&gt;

<p>Conversion to string is <strong>not</strong> the solution to your problem. To store a list efficiently, you need to preserve data types. A csv or text file would also be in appropriate, unless you want to store data type definitions separately.</p>
<p>Instead, use <code>pickle</code> to save and read lists (Python-only solution):</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

with open('list_pickled.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(x, f)
</code></pre>
<p>Then pick up again when required:</p>
<pre><code>with open('list_pickled.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    x_new = pickle.load(f)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You can do <code>print(x)</code></span>

<span class="comment-copy">If you want to store python lists in file, then you should try in-built <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pickle</code></a> package. Pickle package can be used to store python objects to file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're storing simple data formats like this, something like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/json.html#module-json" rel="nofollow noreferrer">json</a> would probably be a better choice than pickle.</span>
