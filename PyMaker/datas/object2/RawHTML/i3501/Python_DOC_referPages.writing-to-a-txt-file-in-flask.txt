<p>I have a variable "inputed_email" that I want to write to a .txt file. However, how would you accomplish this in Flask? Any help is appreciated. Thank you!    </p>
<pre><code>@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def my_form():
    inputed_email = request.form.get("email")
    if request.method == 'POST' and inputed_email:

        # code that writes "inputed_email" to a .txt file

        return render_template('my-form.html', email=inputed_email)
    return render_template('my-form.html')
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Writing to a file has nothing to do with Flask. You can learn how to read/write to files <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. 
Keep in mind writing a large amount of data is slow, and will slow down the request.</p>
<pre><code>if request.method == 'POST' and inputed_email:
    # open is a built-in function, w is for write-mode (default is read)
    with open('workfile', 'w') as f: 
         f.write(inputed_email)
    return render_template(....)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried this, however I got error 500 (internal server error) on my website when submitted the form that gets inputed_email. Why is this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to provide more information, could you post your error trace? Also, try logging <code>inputed_email</code> to see if you are actually getting a valid value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sounds good, I'll work on getting the error trace and logging it. I'll post them in a bit.</span>
