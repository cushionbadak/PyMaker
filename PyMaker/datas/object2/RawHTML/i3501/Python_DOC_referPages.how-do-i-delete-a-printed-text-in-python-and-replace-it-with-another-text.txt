<p>I am kind of bad at all this programming stuff and i need help.</p>
<p>I want my code to print something like hello world and then after lets say 1 second<br/>
delete that text and replace it with how are you?
I have tried various thing like 'clear' and '/b' but nothing is working, if you can help that would be amazing.</p>
<pre><code>import time
print('hello world')
time.sleep(3)
#The text deleting code here...
print('how are you?')
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>end</code> parameter of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print()</code></a>. By default, it's assigned <code>\n</code>. Instead, use a carriage return which is used to move the carriage back to the left side (beginning) of the current line.</p>
<pre><code>import time
print('hello world', end='\r')
time.sleep(3)
#The text deleting code here...
print('how are you?')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">In which environment you're running the code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python Idle is what i'm using.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If your gonna ask the version as well it is 3.6.2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the contribution but when i ran it in Idle it didn't work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unfortunately, Python idle does not support <code>\r</code>. Read about it <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue23220" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. You could run this code on command prompt and get desired output.</span>
