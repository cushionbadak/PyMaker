<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have completed a beginner's course in python and I am working on a problem to improve my coding skills. In this problem, I have to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GC_skew" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GC-skew</a>  by dividing the entire sequence into subsequences of equal length. I am working in a jupyter notebook.
I have to create a code so that I'll get the number of C's and G's from the sequence and then calculate GC skew in each window. window size = 5kb with an increment of 1kb.</p>
<p>What I have done so far is that first stored the sequence in a list and took user input for length of box/window and increment of the box. Then I tried to create a loop for calculating the number of C's and G's in each window but here I am facing an issue as instead of getting number of C's and G's in a window/box, I am getting number of C's and G's from the entire sequence for number of times the loop is running. I want number total number of C's and total no of G's in each window.</p>
<p>Please suggest how can I get the mentioned number of characters and GC skew for each overlapping sliding window/box. Also is there any concept of sliding window in python which I can use it here? </p>
<pre><code>char = []
with open('keratin.txt') as f:
for line in f: 
   line = line.strip()
   for ch in line:
      char.append(ch) 
print(char)  
len(char)

f1 = open('keratin.txt','r')
f2 = open('keratin.txt','a+') 
lob = input('Enter length of box =')  
iob = input('Enter the increment of the box =')    

i=0 
lob = 5000 
iob = 1000   
nob = 1 #no. of boxes 
for i in range (0,len(char)-lob): 
   b = i       
   while( b &lt; lob + i and b &lt; len(char)):          
   nC = 0          
   nG = 0 
   if char[b] == 'C':          
      nC = nC + 1 
   elif char[b] == 'G':             
      nG = nG + 1           
   b = b + 1 
 print(nC)
 print(nG) 
 i = i + iob 
 nob = nob + 1

<p>I hope this would help in understanding,</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Within the while loop, you don't have to run the for loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">okay, now I have removed the for loop but again the problem is I am not getting total number of C's and G's for a window but it is just giving 1 if the character is either C or G throughout the loop and 0 if not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AbhishekMishra can you please help me out?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Trion answer will work.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks. The code worked. Also I edited my original question. As I am still facing an issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SonaliJain It may be better to ask another question rather than change your question once someone provided a satisfactory answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bli okay, next time I'll keep that in my mind.</span>
