<p>Does the csvreader object read the entire file into memory? If I have big data, would it crash because of low memory. Or it's only a pointer so that I can process each line?</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open('RawData.csv','r') as file:
    csvreader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=',')
    for row in csvreader:
        print(row)

<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.reader" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv.reader</code></a> documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return a reader object which will iterate over lines in the given
  csvfile. csvfile can be any object which supports the iterator
  protocol and returns a string each time its <code>__next__()</code> method is
  called â€” <strong>file objects and list objects are both suitable.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>What you have is a <em>wrapper</em> around the file object. The file pointer does all the dirty work of <em>efficiently</em> iterating over the lines of your file, and the csv module's Reader parses those lines as they're read in.</p>
<p>So yes, +1 for memory friendliness and efficiency.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The actual reading happens in the loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is only a pointer it will not load the whole file in the memory. However, it actually depends on the way you are opening the file. .read() loads the complete file in the ram.</span>
