<p>I have a string in python</p>
<pre><code>x =  "orange".
</code></pre>
<p>The program accepts an input string.If the input string matches the wildcard pattern of x, then I perform some operation.
The pattern is </p>
<pre><code>pattern = "#.orange.*" 
</code></pre>
<p># (hash) - can substitute for zero or more words.</p>
<p>*(star) - can substitute for exactly one word.</p>
<p>So, if my input string is "quick.orange.rabbit", then it should match. Can anyone help me how to do this in python??
I have tried - </p>
<pre><code>import re
input_str = input("enter string")
pattern = #.orange.*
p = re.compile(pattern)
if p.match(input_str):
   # do something
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Not sure if I'm understanding the Regex idea correctly, but if I'm correct, you want to match the following:<br/>
(Zero or more words).orange.(Exactly one word)</p>
<p>Now I do not know if the words in the hash are seperated by spaces, periods or are just words after each other, but here are the following cases:</p>
<p><strong>Hash words separated by spaces</strong></p>
<pre><code>pattern = r"(?P&lt;hash&gt;(\w+|\s)*)\.(?P&lt;orange&gt;orange)\.(?P&lt;star&gt;\w+)"
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Hash words seperated by periods</strong></p>
<pre><code>pattern = r"(?P&lt;hash&gt;(\w+|\.)*)\.(?P&lt;orange&gt;orange)\.(?P&lt;star&gt;\w+)"
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Hash words just after each other</strong></p>
<pre><code>pattern = r"(?P&lt;hash&gt;(\w*))\.(?P&lt;orange&gt;orange)\.(?P&lt;star&gt;\w+)"
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>If you don't want to have the (?P&lt;&gt;) syntax, you can also just do the following</p>
<pre><code>pattern = r"(\w+|\s)*\.orange\.\w+"
</code></pre>
<p>Which will match against your string and tell you if it is a match, but you then can't do</p>
<pre><code>match.group('hash')
</code></pre>
<p>To get the hash words.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried? anything at all? an input function at least? You should show us where you're stuck so we don't have to write an entire tutorial for you, just answer your question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Will 'orange' in a matching input string always have a dot immediately before &amp; after it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes. It will have always have a dot immediately before and after it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is basically a RabbitMQ topic exchange principle.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@OferSadan I have edited the question. Please have a look at it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow! This just works perfect. Thanks a lot @Rens Oliemans</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But * means exactly one word. here I can see \w+ which means one or more??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">All right I'd take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Python re documentation</a>.   <code>\w</code> refers to Unicode word characters: most <b>characters</b> that can be part of a word, as well as numbers and underscore. Since these are characters and not words, you use the <code>+</code> character, which indeed means 1 or more characters. Because I your <i>hash</i> words could be more than one, I had the following syntax:   <code>r"(?P&lt;hash&gt;(\w+|\.)*</code>   Explanation: 0 or more words (<code>*</code> character), each words consists of 1 or more characters (<code>\w+</code>), or a period <code>|\.</code>  Is everything clear?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@megna Also, I made a mistake in the regex. I had the character <code>.</code>, but you have to have <code>\.</code>. As you can see in the re documentation, <code>.</code> matches any character except a newline. Whereas this did work, it means that you're going to get a lot of backtracking, as it tries to match everything, rather than just the decimal point (given by <code>\.</code>). I'd recommend you to update your code.</span>
