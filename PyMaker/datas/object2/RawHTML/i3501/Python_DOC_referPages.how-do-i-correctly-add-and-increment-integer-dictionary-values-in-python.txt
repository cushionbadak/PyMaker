<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to read in data from a file. The first few characters of each line are categories, and the last few are amounts. I would like to use the first characters as keys and keep summing the last few characters into the values for their corresponding keys.</p>
<pre><code>dak = open(filename)
zip3 = {}

for l in dak:
    y = l[:3]
    if y in zip3:
        continue
    zip3[y] = int(l[-2:])
</code></pre>
<p>After running this code I get: 
<code>KeyError: '006'</code> where 006 are the first three characters of the line. What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>EDIT: I put my actual code in so it can be run.</p>

<p>The following code ended up working:</p>
<pre><code> dak = open('C:\\WIP\\SubRegions\\MMC2__86-SSX_05-07-2018-15-35-45.dak', 'r')
zip3 = {}

for l in dak:
    y = l[:3]
    if y in zip3:
        continue
    zip3[y] = 0
    zip3[y] = zip3[y] + int(l[-2:])

dak = open('C:\\WIP\\SubRegions\\MMC2__86-SSX_05-07-2018-15-35-45.dak', 'r')
for l in dak:
    y = l[:3]
    zip3[y] = zip3[y] + int(l[-2:])

<span class="comment-copy">Are you just looking for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Counter</code></a> in place of a normal dict? (If not, explain why that isn't what you want.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Meanwhile, you really shouldn't call your dict <code>dict</code>. That's the name of the type, and if you later need to use that type for anything (like building a dict out of a list of pairs, or a Counter, etc.), the error messages will be very confusing.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@abamert, I named it dict just for the sample code I posted. I replaced it with my actual code. The final structure I want is a dictionary with values of quantities from a list with lines of multiple zips and quantities.</span>
