<p>I am trying to install <code>symfit</code> on my Windows machine, running Python 2.7.</p>
<p>It complains that it does not have <code>polytools</code>, so I type <code>pip install polytools</code> in the command line.</p>
<p>This gives the following error message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could not find a versin that satisfies the requirement polytools (from versions: )<br/> No matching distribution found for polytools</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does it mean and how can I solve it?</p>

<p>Polytools module is in <a href="http://docs.sympy.org/latest/_modules/sympy/polys/polytools.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sympy</a> and sympy is a <a href="https://github.com/tBuLi/symfit/blob/master/requirements.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dependency of symfit</a>. It seems <code>symfit</code> doesn't properly declared dependencies. To install its dependencies clone the repository:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/tBuLi/symfit.git
</code></pre>
<p>and run</p>
<pre><code>pip install -U -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">"It complains that it does not have polytools" can you expand on this? The only mention on the internet of both polytools and symfit is this question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is this still an issue? I'm the founder of symfit and I haven't experienced or heard of this problem before, but if it is an active issue then your help in improving symfit would be very much appreciated! As suggested by @phd, if this is still relevant then please post this as an issue on our github, including a more complete description of the exact command used and the resulting errors.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your comment! It's actually fine, I pip installed and uninstalled a few things a few times until it worked. Thanks anyway!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I did that.  But now it's saying: "lockfile 0.10.2.post7 has requirement pbr!=0.7,&lt;1.0,&gt;=0.6, but you'll have pbr 4.0.4 which is incompatible."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually I just installed an earlier version of pbr, and now it does not give me any errors from the pip command. However, when I try using symfit (or sympy) in Spyder it complains "ImportError: cannot import name polytools"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's the traceback?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry what is a traceback?</span>
