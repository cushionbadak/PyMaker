<p>I know of the print_slow function to make a print looks like a human typing. however, how can i make it print out instantly or skip the slow typing to show the print immediately by pressing a key or enter?</p>
<pre><code>    import sys,time,random
def print_slow(str):
    for letter in str:
        sys.stdout.write(letter)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        time.sleep(0.05)

print_slow("Type something here slowly")
</code></pre>
<p>I have a sample code above, would anyone help me out?</p>

<p>You need to use <code>threading</code> trick to simultaneously print and wait for user input. Have a look at this code (pressing Enter key will tell program to print fast): </p>
<pre><code>from threading import Thread
waiting_time = 0.05
def check():
    i = input()
    global waiting_time
    waiting_time = 0
Thread(target = check).start()

import sys,time,random

def print_slow(str):

    for letter in str:
        sys.stdout.write(letter)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        time.sleep(waiting_time)

print_slow("Type something here slowly")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can't you just the builtin <code>print()</code> instead?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Non-blocking keyboard input would be useful here, I bet. Take a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/292095/953482">Polling the keyboard (detect a keypress) in python</a>. Then you can poll for the enter key, and break out of your loop early.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As an aside, please be aware that <code>str</code> is a reserved word in Python, and shouldn't be used as a variable name.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TylerMarques - Your advice is sound, but I need to correct you on one small point.  <code>str</code> is not a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reserved word</a>. It is, however, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built-in type</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Robáµ© Thanks for the correction. My mistake.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The modification of a variable without synchronization is making me so uneasy, even though Python's GIL probably makes this work right.</span>
