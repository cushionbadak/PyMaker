<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a python script that communicates to a device over serial interface. There is a function <code>my_fn()</code> to be exectuted which sends some commands to the serial interface and waits for <code>recieved_fn()</code> to be triggered by device. If <code>recieved_fn()</code> is not triggered within 5 sec then execute <code>my_fn()</code> again.<br/>
How should I monitor if <code>recieved_fn()</code> is executed or not within a time period of 5 seconds.<br/>
I am running python 2.7 on windows 10.<br/>
Thanks</p>

<p>Unfortunately it is hard to provide a generic correct answer without seeing your code and what you are using. What exactly in your code is calling <code>received_fn</code>? </p>
<p>Are you using some sort of event loop that allows event registering? If yes, then you should also use that event loop's timing methods to timeout the triggering.</p>
<p>A more generic approach would be to use a global variable or attribute to do the monitoring.</p>
<p>If you're using threads then maybe an event object is what you want, as they allow waiting with a timeout: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#event-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#event-objects</a></p>
