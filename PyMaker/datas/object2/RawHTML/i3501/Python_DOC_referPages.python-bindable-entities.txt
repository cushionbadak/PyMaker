<p>I saw that, in the book,
Programming Language Design Concepts by John Wiley, 2004,
there is a definition for bindables:</p>
<p>"A bindable entity is one that may be bound to an identifier. Programming languages vary in the kinds of entity that are bindable:</p>
<p>• C’s bindable entities are types, variables, and function procedures.</p>
<p>• JAVA’s bindable entities are values, local variables, instance and class
variables, methods, classes, and packages.</p>
<p>• ADA’s bindable entities include types, values, variables, procedures, exceptions, packages, and tasks."</p>
<p>I'm curious, which bindable entities are in Python?</p>

<p>Any object has an identifier in Python and everything is a object. <code>id()</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id" rel="nofollow noreferrer">function</a> would give an identier for any object:</p>
<pre><code>id(1)
a = 1  
id(a)
import re
id(re)
foo = lambda x: x
id(foo)
</code></pre>
<p>Update: something which is not on object are the statements, but one would not expect them to be (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/865911/is-everything-an-object-in-python-like-ruby">here</a>):</p>
<pre><code>id(if)
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
