<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was trying to make a simple program to extract words from paragraphs in a web page.
my code looks like this -</p>
<pre><code>import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import operator

def start(url):
    word_list = []
    source_code = requests.get(url).text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(source_code)
    for post_text in soup.find_all('p'):
        cont = post_text.string
        words = cont.lower().split()
        for each_word in words:
            print(each_word)
            word_list.append(each_word)


start('https://lifehacker.com/why-finding-your-passion-isnt-enough-1826996673')
</code></pre>
<p>First I am getting this warning -
UserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system ("html.parser"). This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.</p>
<p>The code that caused this warning is on line 17 of the file D:/Projects/Crawler/Main.py. To get rid of this warning, change code that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>BeautifulSoup(YOUR_MARKUP})
</code></pre>
<p>to this:</p>
<pre><code> BeautifulSoup(YOUR_MARKUP, "html.parser")

  markup_type=markup_type))
</code></pre>
<p>and then there is this error in the end:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:/Projects/Crawler/Main.py", line 17, in &lt;module&gt;
    start('https://lifehacker.com/why-finding-your-passion-isnt-enough-1826996673')
  File "D:/Projects/Crawler/Main.py", line 11, in start

    words = cont.lower().split()
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>AttributeError: <code>'NoneType'</code> object has no attribute <code>'lower'</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have tried searching, but not able to resolve or understand the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are parsing that page using the paragraph tag <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, but that tag does not always have textual content associated to it. For instance, if you were to instead run:</p>
<pre><code>def start(url):
    word_list = []
    source_code = requests.get(url).text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(source_code)
    for post_text in soup.find_all('p'):
        print(post_text)
</code></pre>
<p>You would see that you're getting hits off of things like advertisements: <code>&lt;p class="ad-label=bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>.  As others have stated in the comment, <code>None</code> type does not have string methods, which is literally what your error is referring to.</p>
<p>A simple way to guard against this would be to wrap a section of your function in a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">try/except block</a>:</p>
<pre><code>for post_text in soup.find_all('p'):
    try:
        cont = post_text.string
        words = cont.lower().split()
        for each_word in words:
            print(each_word)
            word_list.append(each_word)
    except AttributeError:
        pass
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>for post_text in soup.find_all('p'): print(post_text)</code> what do you see? I suspect you got no matches and it returns <code>None</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're asking two separate questions, which will have two separate answers, which doesn't fit the Q&amp;A format of Stack Overflow. Especially since they're both most likely duplicates of existing questions with good answers, but there's no duplicate question that answers both.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Anyway, for the warning, <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-a-parser" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read the docs</a>. For the error, if a function or attribute reference returns <code>None</code>, you obviously can't call <code>lower()</code> on thatâ€”and, as the docs explain, if you try to search for or navigate to something that doesn't exist, <code>None</code> is what you get.</span>
