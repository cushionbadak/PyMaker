<p>Any idea what could I be missing?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I did a little more research and it seems like pip is not supported on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#embedded-distribution" rel="nofollow noreferrer">embedded distribution</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Third-party packages should be installed by the application installer
  alongside the embedded distribution. Using pip to manage dependencies
  as for a regular Python installation is not supported with this
  distribution, though with some care it may be possible to include and
  use pip for automatic updates.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">As the python version is 3.x execute the command using python3 as <code>python3 get-pip.py</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">there's no python3.exe anywhere, only a python3.dll, python3 not recognized as a command...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">after spending number of hours trying to make different things work in windows + python. I have found Anaconda to be the best option to be used in Windows. if it works for you I would suggest to use Anaconda.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the info, sailing in the same boat as you. I tried the <a href="http://www.clemens-sielaff.com/create-a-portable-python-with-pip-on-windows/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">detailed instructions here</a> after getting the embedded distribution, but ended up with the same error as yours. Looks like regular installation is the only way if you want pip.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">pip is for installing packages so the end goal of pip would be to add packages to the embedded distro. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49737721/adding-packages-to-python-embedded-installation-for-windows">This work-around</a> worked for me, I used git on the Not Embedded Python Dir to track changes after "pip" installations.</span>
