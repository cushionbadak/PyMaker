<p>I'm playing with machine learning algorithms. I use my laptop to develop, but when I want to run some more demanding training I use external server.</p>
<p>The problem I have is how to set a path to dataset so I wouldn't have to change it when copying python files from one platform to another. My current approach is to use the same folder structure and use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4028943/4562957">this</a> to get home directory path. But since some datasets are quite big they are shared among all users, therefore are not in my home directory. My idea is to have a file in my home that will contain all the necessary paths and will be loaded at the beginning, but I'm not convinced that its the best way. (I use python)</p>
<p>Maybe you have some ideas how to do it better?</p>

<p>The typical ways to pass runtime configuration to a script are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A configuration file (See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html</a>)</li>
<li>Environment variable (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ</a>)</li>
<li>An argument passed to your script (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html</a>).</li>

<span class="comment-copy">There is no "best way", but this seems very common sense to me...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I use dictionary with neccessary paths for this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@koPytok its not really related to my question, but I like the idea :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I like the idea with the configuration file, but why not to use json instead?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, use whatever configuration format you're comfortable with</span>
