<p>Is there something like a <code>__sum__</code> method, similar to <code>__add__</code>, in order to sum up a list of instances of classes into a new class instance?</p>
<p>I need this because in my case <code>sum([a,b,c])</code> should be different from <code>sum([sum([a,b]), c])</code>. In other words, the sum really depends on an arbitrary number of arguments, and cannot be defined in terms of a binary operation <code>__add__</code>.</p>

<p>Sum is a built_in function in python. <strong>add</strong> is is special method. every container object such as list have <strong>add</strong> method. You can see it in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">guide</a>. The <strong>add</strong> method in container object and numeric object work differently.</p>
<pre><code>l = [1,2,3]
b = [4,5,6]

#Concatenation using .__add__()
print(l.__add__(b))
</code></pre>
<p>the result will be the concatenation of two list.</p>
<pre><code>[1,2,3,4,5,6]
</code></pre>
<p>while the <strong>add</strong> method in numeric object will do addition operation.</p>
<pre><code>x = 2
y = 3

#addition operation
print(x.__add__(y))
</code></pre>
<p>You can create custom list with sum method.</p>
<pre><code>class Custom(list):
    #adding sum() functionallity
    def sumup(self):
        return sum(self)
</code></pre>
<p>create new custom list object like this:</p>
<pre><code>l = Custom([1,2,3])
</code></pre>
<p>and call the sumup method to sum all values inside the custom list</p>
<pre><code>l.sumup()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">can you please add a class definition to the post?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If your operation is not associative, maybe it should not be called <code>+</code> / <code>sum</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, you can't hook into what <code>sum</code> does. It just iterates over the container and invokes <code>__add__</code>, it doesn't have separate behaviour.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you @jonrsharpe, this seems to be the answer to my question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">read the question again. I think you misunderstood what OP wants</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"<i>the add method will invoked whenever '+' signs is presented</i>", no: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__radd__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__radd__</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've already edit the question</span>
