<p>I have a list called <code>game</code></p>
<pre><code>game = ['X','O',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ']
</code></pre>
<p>I need to select a random element from all the <code>' '</code> elements only. It will then change it to X or O and do again.
Using simple <code>random.choice()</code> has a chance of never ending. <code>random.choices()</code> returns the element instead of its index so I cannot think of a way to update the weights.</p>

<p>Determine which indices have spaces and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.choice</code></a> to choose one</p>
<pre><code>from random import choice

game = ['X','O',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ']
index = choice([i for i, x in enumerate(game) if x == ' '])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Get the indexes of the elements that are blank or ' ' in a list and then do random.choice() on it. and then change corresponding data in your game list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Rejection sampling with repeated calls of <code>random.choice</code> may be a reasonable thing to do here, the probability of it never ending rapidly approaches 0.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@miradulo rejection sampling is new to me and from what I read, I can't see a way to use it here. Can you explain it or give a link that explains it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KushagraGupta Just continue calling <code>random.choice</code> until you happen upon a <code>' '</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. This is exactly what I needed. I can't believe I didn't even think of this.</span>
