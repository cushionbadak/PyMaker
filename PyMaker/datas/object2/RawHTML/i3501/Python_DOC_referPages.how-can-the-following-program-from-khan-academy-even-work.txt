<p>I have just started programming. Please state the simplest explanation. 
My question being, since the user input is assigned to the variable <em>user_input</em> and not the variable <em>number</em>.  how does <em>factorial</em> function recognizes the user input?</p>
<p>Also what does it mean by <em>return product</em> function??</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you call <code>factorial(user_input)</code>, <code>user_input</code> is first evaluated to a value, and then that value is given to the <code>factorial</code> function.  The function binds all the values it receives to the appropriate names in the local symbol table (a mapping between identifiers and values), then begins execution.</p>
<p>The <code>factorial</code> function doesn't know that the value came from your <code>user_input</code> variable.  </p>
<p>In fact, you can call functions using values without assigning them to names first.  <code>factorial(5)</code> and <code>factorial(randint(0, 10))</code> are also valid function calls.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This program works because this snippet of code:</p>
<pre><code>factorial(user_input)
</code></pre>
<p>Takes the value of the variable <code>user_input</code> and passes it to the <code>number</code> variable 
specified in the <code>def factorial(number):</code> function when the function is called.</p>
<p>This works as such because Python is a "Pass By Value" language. The input'ed variable is not used in the function, rather the value associated with it is passed into the function and assigned to a new variable.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Info:</strong>
Java is an example of a "Pass by Reference" Language. I.E. it would use the original variable instead of passing it to a new variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>user_input</code> variable gets passed to the <code>factorial()</code> function with this line</p>
<pre><code>factorial_of_the_number = factorial(user_input)
</code></pre>
<p>Then the the math is handled inside the <code>factorial()</code> function and returned to be stored in the <code>factorial_of_the_number</code> variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is because the function factorial takes a number which has been passed it while calling this function. There is no such necessity that the variable name should be same. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">As a side note: It looks like this is Python 2 code (despite using a Python 3-style <code>print</code>), because otherwise <code>user_input</code> (and therefore <code>number</code>) is going to be a string, not a number. If you're just learning programming in 2018, unless you're specifically learning to work on legacy code, you really should learn a recent version, not an version from the last decade that's going to permanently go out of support in a year and a half.</span>
