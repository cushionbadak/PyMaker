<p>I want to make a for loop with random strings in it. 
I want the names not to repeat themselves and the prices can occur twice (we were with 5 people and there were 2 drill-motor and 2 Dc-motors to give away).
So, 4 people would get a price, 2 people get the drill-motors and 2 people get the DC-motors. </p>
<p>How can I do this? Because when I run, the <code>random.sample</code> repeats itself every time it runs a part of the loop and some names and prices occur too often. Thus, I want the names to occur once and each price twice. </p>
<p>This is the code: </p>
<pre><code>import random

price=["You have won the drill-motor" , "You have won the DC motor"]

Names = ["Hilmi", "Joris", "Isa", "Dennis", "Jasper"]

for i in range (len(Names)-1):
    print(*random.sample(Names,1), *random.sample(price,1))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Easiest would be to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.shuffle" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shuffle</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> appropriate lists:</p>
<pre><code>import random

names = ["Hilmi", "Joris", "Isa", "Dennis", "Jasper"]
prices = 2 * ["You have won the drill-motor" , "You have won the DC motor"]

random.shuffle(names)
random.shuffle(prices)  
# shuffling prices is not strictly necessary
# the random name order already guarantees everybody's fair chance ;)

for name, price in zip(names, prices): 
    print(name, price)

# Hilmi You have won the DC motor
# Jasper You have won the drill-motor
# Dennis You have won the DC motor
# Joris You have won the drill-motor
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can shuffle the names list at the beginning, and just iterate over them once.
Also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.choice</code></a> is the better option than <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.sample</code></a> when only one item is chosen.
Here's the code</p>
<pre><code>import random
price = ["You have won the drill-motor" , "You have won the DC motor"]
names = ["Hilmi", "Joris", "Isa", "Dennis", "Jasper"]
shuffled_names = names[:]  # create a copy if you want original order preserved
random.shuffle(shuffled_names)
for name in shuffled_names:
    print(name, random.choice(price))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What you're describing isn't random, but permutations. Did I understand correctly?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might as well use <code>random.choice(Names)</code> instead of <code>*random.sample(Names, 1)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">FYI <code>price</code> is what you have to pay, the one you can win is called <code>prize</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was just writing this, this is correct, voted up.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I didn't know the zip function, did some research and now I understand! But one more question: After I shuffle the names, each time I print names, do I always get a shuffled names list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jan <code>shuffle</code> does an in-place shuffle of the list. So the original list now is and remains shuffled. It does not, however, magically reshuffle everytime you print it if that's what you mean :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This would not ensure both prices being won twice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">We don't <i>need</i> to ensure that prices must occur twice. The question says prices <i>can</i> appear twice. Prices are allowed to appear twice. Not a necessary condition.</span>
