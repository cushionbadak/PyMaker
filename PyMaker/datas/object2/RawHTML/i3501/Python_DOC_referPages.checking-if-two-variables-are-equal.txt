<p>In my code I'm making a basic multiplying game.</p>
<p>But in my game,</p>
<p>When you get the answer right, it says you got it wrong</p>
<p>Here's my whole code:</p>
<pre><code>import random

score = 0
while True:
    num1 = random.choice(range(1,12))
    num2 = random.choice(range(1,12))
    answer = num1 * num2
    a = input("Solve for " + str(num1) + "x" + str(num2))
    if a == answer:
        print("congrats you got it right")
        score += 1
    else:
        print("Wrong sorry play again")
        print("Score was: " + str(score))
        break
</code></pre>
<p>When I get the right answer I get </p>
<pre><code>Solve for 7x10 70
Wrong sorry play again
Score was: 0
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Other languages might let you get away with this, but Python is strongly typed. The input function gets a string, not a number. Numbers can't be equal to strings. Either convert the number to a string or the string to a number before you compare them. You can use <code>str</code> or <code>int</code> to convert.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Function <code>input</code> returns what was typed as a <strong>string</strong>... in order to compare it with the answer, you need to either convert it to <code>int</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if int(a) == answer:
</code></pre>
<p>or the other way around (convert answer to <code>str</code>):</p>
<pre><code>if a == str(answer):
</code></pre>
<p>The first one may raise an exception if <code>a</code> is not parseable to an <code>int</code>.

<p>PS: I really wonder how ur random library picked a 1070 sampling from 0 to 11...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Or use <code>int(input())</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import random

score = 0
while True:
    num1 = random.choice(range(1,12))
    num2 = random.choice(range(1,12))
    answer = num1 * num2
    a = int(input("Solve for " + str(num1) + "x" + str(num2)))
    if a == answer:
        print("congrats you got it right")
        score += 1
    else:
        print("Wrong sorry play again")
        print("Score was: " + str(score))
        break
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">When I change it to int I get  a = input("Solve for " + int(num1) + "x" + int(num2)) TypeError: must be str, not int</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have fixed it, I made it str(a) == str(answer):</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I also wondered that but the case is 7 and 10 is random picked integer and 70 is the input provided to program there is no space thatsy its looking like the number is 1070</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hes right. I have gone ahead and added spaces.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh i see! you could add <code>+ " = "</code> to your input ;)</span>
