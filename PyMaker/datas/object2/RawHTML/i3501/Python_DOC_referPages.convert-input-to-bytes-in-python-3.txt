<p>Since I started using version 3 of Python I have had many problems with sending string through sockets. I know that to send a string in a socket, a <code>'b'</code> must be placed before the string to convert it to bytes. But what happens when I have to convert an <code>input()</code> to bytes? How is it done?</p>
<p>I need to send a message written by keyboard to a socket:</p>
<pre><code>import socket

client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client.connect(("localhost",7500))

msg = input()
client.send(msg) 
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I try it, I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
</code></pre>
<p>Can someone tell me how I convert <code>input()</code> to bytes? I always use version 2.7 and I do not understand why version 3 is so irritating for the handling of sockets.  :(</p>

<p>You need to <code>encode</code> you message like this:</p>
<pre><code>msg = input().encode()
</code></pre>
<p>The reason you did not need to do this in Python 2 is because unicode strings were then their own type, but <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#text-vs-data-instead-of-unicode-vs-8-bit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in Python 3 all strings are now unicode by default</a>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To do that, you can use</p>
<pre><code>import socket
client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client.connect(("localhost",7500))
msg = input()
client.send(msg.encode())
</code></pre>
<p>It returns the string encoded as a bytes object. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.encode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.encode</a></p>
