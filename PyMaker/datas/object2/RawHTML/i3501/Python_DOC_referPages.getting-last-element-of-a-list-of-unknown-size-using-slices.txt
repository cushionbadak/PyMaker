<p>Let's say I have a list of unknown size, then I can access the last element using:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = list(range(10))
&gt;&gt;&gt; l[-1]
9
</code></pre>
<p>However, is there any way to do this via a slice object like</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = slice(-1, 10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; l[s]
[9]
</code></pre>
<p>without knowing the length of my list?</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>I simplified my Question a bit. I am fine with getting a list back, since I am iterating over the sublist later. I just needed a way of getting the last item of list besides being able to get every second element and so on ...</p>
</div>

<p>Yes, just use <code>None</code> as the <code>end</code> argument:</p>
<pre><code>In [53]: l[slice(-1, None)]
Out[53]: [9]
</code></pre>
<p>This will of course produce a list <code>[9]</code>, rather than the <code>9</code> in your question, because slicing a list always produces a sublist rather than a bare element.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If your objective is to pass arguments which you can use to index a list, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.itemgetter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>operator.itemgetter</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from operator import itemgetter

L = range(10)

itemgetter(-1)(L)  # 9
</code></pre>
<p>In my opinion, for this specific task, <code>itemgetter</code> is cleaner than extracting a list via a slice, then extracting the only element of the list.</p>
<p>Note also that this works on a wider range of objects than just lists, e.g. with <code>range</code> as above.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Great, thats exactly what I was looking for! The docs are a bit sparse.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@schwobaseggl I can't use len(l) here, since I want to pass the slice as function argument. Hence l is unknown when the slice is created.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also this will return an empty list if your list is empty (not sure if that's what you want though)</span>
