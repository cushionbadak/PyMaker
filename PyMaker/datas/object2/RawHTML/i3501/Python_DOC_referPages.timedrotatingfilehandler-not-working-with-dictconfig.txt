<p>Set "backupCount" to nonzero. To understand it, read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If backupCount is nonzero, at most backupCount files will be kept, and if more would be created when rollover occurs, the oldest one is deleted. The deletion logic uses the interval to determine which files to delete, so changing the interval may leave old files lying around.</p>

<p>I hope it will help you.</p>
