<p>How do I put the current date into a list in the format I want?</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
today = datetime.date.today()
lst=[]
lst.append(today)

lst[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.date(2018, 6, 22)
print(lst[0]) #found this code on another post (I have no idea how it works)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2018-06-22
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to get "2018-06-22", which is the output of print(lst[0]), into my list but I can only get "datetime.date(2018, 6, 22)". Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<pre><code>lst.append(str(today))
</code></pre>
<p>Using this code gets me the same results and I have no idea how it works.</p>

<p>I would use the <code>strftime()</code> function built into the <code>datetime</code> module.  To do this with your code above, you only need to make one change:</p>
<pre><code>import datetime
today = datetime.date.today()
lst=[]
lst.append(today.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))
lst[0]
</code></pre>

<p><code>print</code> is creating a string version of the object. Try casting it yourself: </p>
<pre><code>str(lst[0])
&gt;&gt;&gt; '2018-06-21'

<p>The issue is that in Python, all dates or objects. Essentially, when you are are referencing it, you are referencing the instance of the object. If you want to get the value (the actual date), you need to do what the others have recommended and cast it as a String, changing it from the actual date object into something useable. For instance, try:</p>
<pre><code>x = str(lst[0])
x -&gt; "2018-06-21"
</code></pre>
<p>I know the following doesn't actually answer your question directly, but it does provide some good info about date times if you are trying to learn more about them. I assume this is where you got your code from, so just browse again. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">You're just looking for the string of a date.  Try <code>[str(datetime.date(2018, 6, 22))]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Best bet here is to use the <code>strftime()</code> function in <code>datetime</code> so that they can change the formatting as needed more easily down the road</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Mike-SMT No it's not.  It's a <code>datetime.date</code> object.  Try <code>type(datetime.date(2018, 6, 22))</code></span>
