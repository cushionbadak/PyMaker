<p>I think this code caching all the lines when loop is started. I deleting some of the lines from the file but it still repeating deleted lines. How can I change loop while in it?</p>
<pre><code>def wanted(s,d):
    print("deneme = " + str(s))
    count = 0
    total = 0
    TG_count = TC_count = TA_count = GC_count = CC_count = CG_count = GG_count = AA_count = AT_count = TT_count = CT_count = AG_count = AC_count = GT_count = 0
    for x in range(d,fileCount):
        print(str(x+1) + 'st file processing...')
        searchFile = open(str(x) + '.txt',encoding = 'utf-8',mode = "r+")
        l = searchFile.readlines()
        searchFile.seek(0)
        for line in l:
            if s in line[:12]:
                blabla()
            else:
                searchFile.write(line)
        searchFile.truncate()
        searchFile.close()

for p in range(fileCount):
  searchFile = open(str(p) + '.txt',encoding = 'utf-8',mode = "r+")
  for z in searchFile.readlines():
      wanted(z[:12],p)
  print("Progressing file " + str(p) + " complete")

<p>I guess it's Python. Yes, <code>readlines()</code> reads the whole file at once. In order to avoid this you can use:</p>
<pre><code>for x in file:
    something()
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe you can find the appropriate information in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a>. It says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use list(f) or f.readlines().
  So yes, all lines are read and stored in memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also the manual says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>f.readline() reads a single line from the file; 
  More details can be found in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html?highlight=truncate#module-io" rel="nofollow noreferrer">manual</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Python.........</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then put that as a tag for your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Either you will get errors when you run this code, in this case post the error messages, too, or you didn't paste the code correctly, in this case please post the code that you actually use.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I pasted all the required parts and I think my question is not that hard. I hope I can get help instead of negative feedback.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not working. Still processing deleted lines.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TuÄŸberk - You need to provide a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> showing how the lines are deleted and what you expect to happen. Also include a source file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added........ As you see, I deleting lines from the file. My loop contains lines and I want to change them lines while running loop.</span>
