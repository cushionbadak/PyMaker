<p>I'm trying to build a chatbot using Snips NLU installed on my computer, but when I download the Languages resources this message appears:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NGNLR.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Languages resources not linked</a></p>
<p>when trying to run the Quickstart from <a href="https://snips-nlu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://snips-nlu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html</a>  this error shows:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bRags.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Language Resource Error</a></p>
<p>I would like to know what I am doing wrong or if I did a bad installation.</p>
<p>Also I want to use Spanish and English resources for different projects.</p>

<p>You may have some permission issue, as it seems that you are not using <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">virtualenv</a>. </p>
<p>The snips-nlu lib creates a symbolic link after resources are downloaded, which requires sufficient permissions.</p>
