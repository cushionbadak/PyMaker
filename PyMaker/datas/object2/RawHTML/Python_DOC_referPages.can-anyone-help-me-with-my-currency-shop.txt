<p>I'm a little bit new to python but i know like the basics like variables and strings, i recently create a discord bot with a currency and a shop. The shop doesn't work, its meant to let me buy a ticket for the item listed (it isn't meant to store anything).Could you please help me find out where i went wrong and help me make it better or show me where i went wrong where i can find me my answer. Here is what i got for the shop (note i'm using python 3.6.4):</p>
<pre><code>@client.command(pass_context = True)
async def buy(ctx, item):
    items = {
    "Apex Legends":[3,20],
    "Minecraft":[5,30],
    "Halo":[5,20],
    "Fortnite":[8,10],
    }
while True:
    print("Apex Legends = 3BP / Minecraft = 5BP / Halo = 5BP / Fortnite = 8BP")
    print("Account Balance bp",stash)
    choice = input("What would you like to buy?: ").strip().title()
    if choice in items:
        if items[choice][1]&gt;0:
            if stash&gt;=items[choice][0]:
                items[choice][1]=items[choice][1]-1
                stash= stash-items[choice][0]
                print("Thank you..!")
                print("")
            else:
                print("Sorry you don\'t enough money...")
                print("")
        else:
            print("sorry sold out")
            print("")
    else:
        print("Sorry we don\'t have that item...")
        print("")

<li>You shouldn't need the <code>while True:</code> as this will enter an infinite loop since you have no <code>break</code> statements! </li>
<li>Replace all <code>print()</code> statements with <code>await client.say()</code> statements</li>
</ol>
<p>Try this</p>
<pre><code>@client.command(pass_context = True)

        "Fortnite": [8, 10],
    }
    await client.say("Apex Legends = 3BP / Minecraft = 5BP / Halo = 5BP / Fortnite = 8BP")
