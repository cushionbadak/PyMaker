<p>I was wondering how to read a text file in Python that contains some information in date, time, name, binary, and float values. </p>
<p>Here are part of the text file:</p>
<pre><code>19-03-15, 16:00:00, Tom@gmail.com, 0, 26.94
15-01-01, 17:42:50, Emily@gmail.com, 1, 27.73
00-03-24, 16:10:06, Tom@univ.edu, 0, 26.9
16-05-15, 06:59:23, Alex@yahoo.com, 0, Missing_value
01-12-31, 23:01:00, Sophia@gmail.com, 1, 27.1666
</code></pre>
<p>I am going to use this information later as a dataset for building a machine learning model.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's likely you need pandas:</p>
<pre><code>df = pd.read_csv('yourfile.txt',sep=', ',headers=yourcolumns)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">That kind of file is called csv (comma separated values). Check out the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv module</a> or you can use <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pandas library</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What type of data is your machine learning model accepting as input?</span>
