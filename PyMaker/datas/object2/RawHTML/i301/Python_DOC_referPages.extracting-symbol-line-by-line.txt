<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a question w.r.t extracting a string, with varied len, from individual line breaks that are only demarcated by '|' and spaces. Take a look at the following link</p>
<p><a href="http://ftp.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/SymDir/nasdaqlisted.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://ftp.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/SymDir/nasdaqlisted.txt</a></p>
<p>I am trying to extract all the company symbols under the first column of the above link. However, I cant think of a logic loop that will do that and store it in a way that is easy for extraction in the future. </p>
<p>I was hoping any pr0s may have an opinion!</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Hi I understand some of your reservations. I would be very satisfied with how to think about the solution logically. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I hope this helps your case where you directly scrape data off the text page:</p>
<pre><code>import requests

response = requests.get('http://ftp.nasdaqtrader.com/dynamic/SymDir/nasdaqlisted.txt')
document = response.text.splitlines()

for line in document[1:-1]:      #This helps you skip unnecessary lines
    data = line.split('|')
    symbol = data[0]
    print(symbol)
</code></pre>
<p>You can skip the first and last line of the <code>document</code> since they are not associated with the <code>symbols</code> you are looking for. Also, <code>splitlines</code> creates a list of lines for you and you can use list index to skip the first and last lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Have a look at the python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv module</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('nasdaqlisted.txt', 'r') as csvFile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvFile, delimiter='|')
    for row in reader:
        print(row[0])

csvFile.close()
</code></pre>
<p>You just need to change the delimiter to <code>'|'</code> and it works out of the box.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">We'd much rather help people who have already given it a try. Can you show us the code you've tried?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So you want <code>AABA</code> from <code>AABA|Altaba Inc. - Common Stock|Q|N|N|100|N|N </code>??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have tried, but the code is way too embarrassing to be on here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DevanshuMisra yes! I tried using beautiful soup to extract the webpage, but I got stuck at moving between lines and extracting the symbols with varied lengths. I used the logic of extracting the first 4 alphabets, but that breaks down at 3 alphabets</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you share the link to the page you are trying to extract?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'll get to reading the python docs more often... and sure thing!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@LowaiisTan More than reading the python docs, it is important to practice coding as much as you can. Hackerrank.com is something you should visit if you want better logic building.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Noted, long way to go, to be a pr00000! and yes, its done!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, will check out this CSV solution in detail!</span>
