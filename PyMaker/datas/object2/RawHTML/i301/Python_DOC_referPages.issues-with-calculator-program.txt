<p>I am very new to Python and I have written my first code to calculate the area of shapes. Each time I run it on Jupyter, it says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Type Error. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>where I got things wrong? (I am using Python 3).</p>
<pre><code># Calculator code for the area of the shape

print("1 rectangle")
print ("2 squared")
print ("3 circle")
shape = input ("&gt;&gt; ")

if shape ==1:
   length = input ("What is the length of the rectangle?") 
   breadth = input ("What is the breadth of the rectangle?")
   area = length * breadth *2
   print ("the area of your rectangle", area)

elif shape == 2:
  length = input ("what is the length of one side of the squared")
  area = length *breadth
  print ("the area of your square is ", area)

else shape ==3:
  radius = input ("what is the radius of your circle")
  area = radius *radius*3.14
  print ("area of your circle is ", area)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have some things wrong in your code:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have not provided any type to your input. Replace it with <code>float</code> for better calculation.</li>
<li>You have written the wrong syntax of <code>else</code>. See the <strong><em><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></em></strong></li>
<li>You have calculated the area of square wrongly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try below code:</p>
<pre><code>print("1 rectangle")
print("2 squared")
print("3 circle")
shape = input ("&gt;&gt; ")

if shape == 1:
    length = float(input ("What is the length of the rectangle?"))
    breadth = float(input ("What is the breadth of the rectangle?"))
    area = length * breadth *2
    print ("the area of your rectangle", area)

elif shape == 2:
    length = float(input ("what is the length of one side of the squared"))
    area = length * length
    print ("the area of your square is ", area)

else:
    radius = float(input ("what is the radius of your circle"))
    area = radius *radius*3.14
    print ("area of your circle is ", area)
</code></pre>
