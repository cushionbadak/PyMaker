<p>I have a <code>.txt</code> with data I need to parse to an <code>object</code> that should then be put in a <code>list</code>. The <code>.txt</code> file i huge but here's a sample:</p>
<pre><code>5764;3/13/2015 8:00:00 AM;3/13/2015 1:00:00 PM;
C5CA;1/3/2015 12:30:00 PM;1/3/2015 1:00:00 PM;
</code></pre>
<p>It's all in one chunk, separated with semicolons. The sample consists of two objects with <code>id</code>, <code>time_start</code> and <code>time_end</code></p>
<p>I have created a <code>class</code> that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Employee:

def __init__(self, id, time_start, time_end):
    self.id = id
    self.time_start = time_start
    self.time_end = time_end
</code></pre>
<p>The main part looks like this, with opening the file and trying to parse it:</p>
<pre><code>my_array_with_objects = []

my_file = open("test.txt", "r")

for item in my_file:
    temp_employee = Employee()
    temp_employee.id = item_first_semicolon_part
    temp_employee.time_start = item_second_semicolon_part
    temp_employee.time_end = item_third_semicolon_part

    my_array_with_objects.append(temp_employee)

myFile.close()
</code></pre>
<p>So, the problem is, I don't know how to access the specific parts of the <code>.txt</code> file, separated by the semicolons. Obviously "item_first_semicolon_part" won't work. But how do I access the first part of the text file so that I do get the <code>id</code> number and nothing else (and then the start and end times)? Is there an elegant way of doing this or simply a matter of using <code>if ; do this</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. I have looked through similar questions, but don't think there was anything that could help me through this.</p>
<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>
I got a great answer from @Alderven that worked, but I just noticed that the parsed object cuts away a part of the id. I simplified the id for the sake of this question. Full id (with the rest of the data) looks like this: </p>
<p><code>57646786307395936680161735716561753784;3/13/2015 8:00:00 AM;3/13/2015 1:00:00 PM;C5CAACCED1B9F361761853A7F995A1D4F16C8BCD0A5001A2DF3EC0D7CD539A09AA7DDA1A5278FA07554B0260880882CCBB30B3399C3C0974C587A8233E5788A81DEAD2921123CB12D13CC11318C38B9679D868145315F1BE24333202D12B3787E51D1BBF97BB25482B0EF7E97DE637BAACEDD74E89E2AC52139EE9369F1D64A6

<p>The part:
 <code>C5CAACCED1B9F361761853A7F995A1D4F16C8BCD0A5001A2DF3EC0D7CD539A09AA7DDA1A5278FA07554B0260880882CCBB30B3399C3C0974C587A8233E5788A81DEAD2921123CB12D13CC11318C38B9679D868145315F1BE24333202D12B3787E51D1BBF97BB25482B0EF7E97DE637BAACEDD74E89E2AC52139EE9369F1D64A6</code> </p>
<p>seems to be missing. Perhaps because it is on the same row as the first object. The last part of the <code>id</code> is still there:</p>
<p><code>259939411636051033617118653993975778241</code> </p>
<p>How do I get the full id?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Actually it is CSV format with <code>;</code> delimiter. Basically:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open('test.txt', newline='\n') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=';')
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to parse data to your <code>Employee</code> class, then:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, id, timeStart, timeEnd):
        self.id = id
        self.timeStart = timeStart
        self.timeEnd = timeEnd

myArrayWithObjects = []
with open('test.txt', newline='\n') as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=';')
    for row in reader:
        myArrayWithObjects.append(Employee(row[0], row[1], row[2]))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can split a row using <code>item.split(';')</code> to get turn it into a list.</p>
<p>you could also parse it as a csv into an array using csvreader or pandas, but that is a separate approach.</p>
<p>if the order is right you can unpack that directly into an employee object using <code>tmpemployee = Employee(*item.split(';'))</code></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to split the line by <code>;</code> using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.split</code></a>:</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; parts = line.split(";")
&gt;&gt;&gt; parts

<p>You can shorten this by removing the last <code>;</code> from the line and assigning multiple values at once:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; line = "5764;3/13/2015 8:00:00 AM;3/13/2015 1:00:00 PM;"
&gt;&gt;&gt; line = line.strip(";")
&gt;&gt;&gt; ID, start, end = line.split(";")
&gt;&gt;&gt; ID
'5764'
&gt;&gt;&gt; start
'3/13/2015 8:00:00 AM'
&gt;&gt;&gt; end
'3/13/2015 1:00:00 PM'
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the <code>csv.reader</code> method with <code>;</code> as the delimiter, but slice only the first 3 items of each row since you have a redundant trailing <code>;</code> on each line of the input:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
    myArrayWithObjects = [Employee(*row[:3]) for row in csv.reader(delimiter=';')]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Unrelated to question but you are calling you Employee constructor badly. It should be: <code>employee = Employee(first_part, second_part, third_part)</code>. And also please don't use camelCase for variables <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 8</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wow, it worked great! Thanks alot for your help! New to Python so had no idea about the csv format :) Not sure about what all the details mean though: <code>newline</code> when is that used?, <code>as f</code>? Is there some documentation I can read up on? Thanks again though!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One small thing that seems to be funky. See update in main question...</span>
