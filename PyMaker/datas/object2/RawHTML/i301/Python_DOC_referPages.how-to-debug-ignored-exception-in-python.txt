<p>I got a lot of ignored exceptions when my (python 2.7) program exits. But since the project scale is large, and based on a project developed by others, it's hard to locate the bug with such info. Is there any way to get the exception trace, or any other methods that can help? Thanks.</p>
<pre><code>Exception TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not callable" in &lt;object repr() failed&gt; ignored
Exception TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not callable" in &lt;object repr() failed&gt; ignored
Exception TypeError: "'NoneType' object is not callable" in &lt;object repr() failed&gt; ignored

<p>You can run:</p>
<pre><code>$ python -v your_file.py

<p>I would scan the codebase for strings that match the output.  Something like <code>Exception .* ignored</code> as the exception and object information are likely to be formatting variables.  This should find the statements that generate the output.</p>
<p>Once you have found these statements, assuming that they are inside a try / except block you can use the tools in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">traceback</a> module to print the tracebacks, or, if the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">logging</a> package is being used, pass the keyword argument <code>exc_info=True</code> to the log <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.debug" rel="nofollow noreferrer">method</a>.</p>
<p>It's also  worth scanning to see if <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.excepthook" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sys.excepthook</a> is being overridden.</p>
