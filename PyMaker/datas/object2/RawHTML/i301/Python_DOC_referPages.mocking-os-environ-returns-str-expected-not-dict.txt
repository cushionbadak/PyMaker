<p>You are trying to pass the dict with a <code>key</code> <code>URL</code> which is causing the problem.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this documentation</a> for further approach.</p>
<p>Try below code:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import unittest
from mock import patch
with patch.dict('os.environ',{"devUrl":"https://devurl.com","testUrl":"https://testurl.com"}):
     print(os.environ['devUrl'])
     print(os.environ['testUrl'])

<span class="comment-copy">What you're posted isn't syntactically valid. Also the environment is represented as a dictionary of <i>strings</i>, so your test double doesn't match the thing it's replacing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you are trying to pass two urls by mentioning them as dev and test in a dict but that's not the right way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please don't post pictures of code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The code for which test case has to be written has URL in it. So, I cannot remove it. If I remove URL, I wont get the above mentioned error. But I need URL in it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't use the dictionary that way in <code>path.dict</code>. So in order to access it, you need to remove URL and look for a workaround for your test cases.</span>
