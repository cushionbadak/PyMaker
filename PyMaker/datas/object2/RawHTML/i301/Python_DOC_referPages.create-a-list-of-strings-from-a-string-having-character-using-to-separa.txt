<p>I have a sample input string as follows: </p>
<pre><code>med_str = 'Film-coated tablet + ALpha Chloro, Prolonged-release tablet + ALFU Dioxide'
</code></pre>
<p>I want to create a list of strings separated by '+'. OUTPUT expected:</p>
<pre><code>med_str = ['Film-coated tablet', 'ALpha Chloro'], ['Prolonged-release tablet', 'ALFU Dioxide']
</code></pre>
<p>There might be cases where there would be only one '+' separated string. Example:</p>
<pre><code>new_str = 'Tablet + DEFLAZo'
</code></pre>
<p>OUTPUT expected:</p>
<pre><code>new_str = ['Tablet', 'DEFLAZo']
</code></pre>
<p>How do I do this using an if else in python which should take care of all the cases and create a separate list of strings separated by comma whenever there is/isn't one or more than one elements with '+' in the string and separated by comma.</p>

<p>Assuming your string always has a whole number of paris, here's how it could be done:</p>
<pre><code>med_str = 'Film-coated tablet + ALpha Chloro, Prolonged-release tablet + ALFU Dioxide'

cleaned = [s.strip() for s in med_str.replace('+',',').split(',')]
result = [[cleaned[i], cleaned[i+1]] for i in range(0, len(cleaned), 2)]
print(result)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>[['Film-coated tablet', 'ALpha Chloro'], ['Prolonged-release tablet', 'ALFU Dioxide']]
</code></pre>

<p>Use First Splinting the (,) if its success it will split list into different list with two string concatenated now just split with (+) to get The Remaining Result</p>
<pre><code>med_str = 'Film-coated tablet + ALpha Chloro, Prolonged-release tablet + ALFU Dioxide'

final=[l.split("+") for l in med_str.split(",")]
print(final)

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try this :</p>
<pre><code>med_str = [i.split(" + ") for i in med_str.split(", ")] # Gives output as list of lists.

<p>or</p>
<pre><code>med_str = tuple(i.split(" + ") for i in med_str.split(", ")) # Gives output as tuple of lists.

<span class="comment-copy">Looks like split on <code>', '</code> followed by splitting each of the results by <code>' + '</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>split</code></a> the string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. I am getting a nested list which I am not looking for. How to only keep each list separated by comma and not a list of lists</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@7answers, your expected output <code>med_str = ['Film-coated tablet', 'ALpha Chloro'], ['Prolonged-release tablet', 'ALFU Dioxide']</code> is actually a tuple of list. You can get the desired result either as a list of lists or tuple of lists. Otherwise, the final result would get flattened like <code>['Film-coated tablet', 'ALpha Chloro', 'Prolonged-release tablet', 'ALFU Dioxide']</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah then how do I make it into a tuple of lists from list of lists</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Updated the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the reason that we cannot get output as this: ['Film-coated tablet', 'ALpha Chloro'], ['Prolonged-release tablet', 'ALFU Dioxide']</span>
