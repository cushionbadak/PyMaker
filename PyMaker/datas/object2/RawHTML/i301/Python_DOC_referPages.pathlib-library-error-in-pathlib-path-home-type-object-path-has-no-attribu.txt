<p>So I've just updated matplotlib to version 3.0.2 . I can import matplotlib just fine, but when I try to <code>import matplotlib.pyplot</code>, I get : </p>

<p>I'm on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, on Jupyter Lab 0.35.4 with python3.6.7.</p>
<p>Side information/question : Before installing jupyter lab this morning, I was using jupyter notebook with python3.6.0. Now the kernels says it is using python3.6.7, although I cannot seem to find it anywhere on my system.</p>
<p>That being told, when I import anything else that doesn't rely on matplotlib.pyplot, everything works perfectly. If I try seaborn, for example, it returns me to the same attribute error.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> In fact, the error happens with the pathlib library. It also happens whether or not I'm in jupyter. To replicate it : </p>
<pre><code>from pathlib import Path
Path.home() 
</code></pre>
<p>and the error is the same as before : </p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: type object 'Path' has no attribute 'home'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>what about the classic trick of uninstalling matplotlib and installing it again?</p>
<pre><code>pip uninstall matplotlib==3.0.2
pip install matplotlib==3.0.2
</code></pre>
<p>Also, if you are not doing it already, I strongly suggest you should check using virtual environments (e.g. <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this guide</a>) as you will have absolute control on which packages you install/modify/uninstall in a particular virtualenv (not affecting your development environment for all your projects).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The error would suggest that you use a python version &lt; 3.5. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.home" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doc</a> However, there is at least one other user <a href="https://longervision.github.io/2019/01/09/Bugs/matplotlib-path-home/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">with the same problem</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah ! Saw that, however I was thinking that there might be an other way before editing the matplotlob files.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would by all means not recommend editing the matplotlib source. Rather you should try to find out why <code>from pathlib import Path; Path.home()</code> fails for you. That is independent of matplotlib.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry for the delay, it would seem it is a rather uncommon error for pathlib since I cannot find information on it !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think I would start by finding out if it works outside of jupyter lab or not. Of course any further information you can provide about your system and environment might help someone to identify any potential problem. For sure the question might attract more attention if it is asked outside the context of matplotlib.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your reply! BTW, you link has an extra http:// . I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling matplotlib and also pathlib for good measures. I've been able to replicate the error with : <code>from pathlib import Path</code> then <code>Path.home()</code> but there is no such attribute in <code>Path</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks! fixed the link. What do you get when you run <code>Path.cwd()</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">returns my home folder (<code>/home/galex</code>)</span>
