<p>Read the following <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#module-encodings.utf_8_sig" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. Here a toy example:</p>
<pre><code>import codecs
...
with codecs.open(file_path,'w','utf-8-sig') as writer:
   writer.write("Start of string\n")
   writer.write(u"This is a unicode character Î­\n")
   writer.write(u"or encoded as \u03AD")

<span class="comment-copy">Isn't your file empty? An empty file is neither ASCII (<i>sic</i>) nor UTF8, it is just an empty file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you fix it for me? Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try writing something to the file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Loocid can you fix it for me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Monso give it a shot yourself first, like said.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">is there any way left blank but still utf-8 does not</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean . I want to not add any characters to the text. but it still utf-8</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just replace all of the writes with <code>pass</code>, like this <code>with codecs.open(file_path,'w','utf-8-sig') as writer: pass</code></span>
