<p>I've been set a task to iteratively calculate the value of x of the given formula : <strong>x</strong>3 - 3x + 4 = 0** using trial and error.
The code will first plug in -1.5 as its first guess and then work up or down from there to try and get the answer 0. Every time a number is plugged in the equation the code should output "Answer ## is too big/small"</p>
<p>I've started the code but I'm a bit stuck as it only does it twice and then stops. I used a while loop but I don't think I've used it correctly or that it may be the wrong way to go about this problem. Any suggestions/snippets of code will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<pre><code>import cmath
end = ''

num = 0
guess = -1.5
calculation = (guess**3 - guess * 3 + 4)
print(calculation)
while calculation &lt; 0:
    print("Guess is too small")
else:
    print("Guess is too large")

while calculation != 0 and calculation &lt; 0:
    guess = guess + 0.1 
    calculation = (guess**3 - guess * 3 + 4)
else:
    guess = guess-0.1
    calculation = ((guess**3)-3*guess+4)
    print(calculation)
</code></pre>

<p>Unclear exactly what you're looking for, but this should get you started:</p>
<pre><code>import cmath

guess = -1.5

#put calculations that you use more than once in a function
def calc(a): 
    return round((a**3-a*3+4),1) #round your result

calculation=calc(guess)

while calculation !=0:
    if calculation&lt;0:
        print('Number is too small')
        guess+=0.1
        calculation=calc(guess)
    elif calculation&gt;0:
        print('Number is too large')
        guess-=0.1
        calculation=calc(guess)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You've confused the concepts of <code>while</code> and <code>if</code>.  You need both for ... well, for what I <em>think</em> you're trying to do, try the following outline.</p>
<pre><code>while calculation != 0:
    if calculation &lt; 0:
        # Guess is too small; print message and adjust guess
    else:
        # Guess is too large; print message and adjust guess
</code></pre>
<p>I think you can fill in the logic for each branch of the "if".
Especially note that this will terminate only if you get an <em>exact</em> answer.  If you want to work in a little tolerance, you'll have to adjust the exit condition <code>calculation != 0</code> to have a little "wiggle room".</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you need to put everything inside a single <code>while</code> loop, where you check if your calculation matches the expected result, adjust the guess if not, break the loop if yes.</p>
<pre><code>guess = -1.5

while True:
    calculation = ((guess**3)-3*guess+4)
    print(calculation)

    if abs(calculation - 0) &lt; 0.1:
        print("Correct guess: ", guess)
        break

    elif calculation &lt; 0:
        print("Guess is too small")
        guess = guess + 0.1 

    elif calculation &gt; 0:
        print("Guess is too large")
        guess = guess - 0.1
</code></pre>
<p>Note that I do not compare <code>calculation == 0</code> because as you choose a step of <code>0.1</code> for <code>guess</code>, it's unlikely that your calculation will be exactly <code>0</code>. In other words, <code>calculation == 0</code> will be always <code>false</code> and the loop will never stop. Hence I check that <code>calculation</code> is close enough to <code>0</code>, using a tolerance value of <code>0.1</code> (same of the step used). In python 3.5 or later, you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose" rel="nofollow noreferrer">math.isclose</a> from the math module to perform this same check.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">thank you for the comment, I'll have a go. Sorry for the confusion, I'm not very good at explaining things :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its doesn't stop printing "your answer is too large"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">when I use the end function it only does it once and stops</span>
