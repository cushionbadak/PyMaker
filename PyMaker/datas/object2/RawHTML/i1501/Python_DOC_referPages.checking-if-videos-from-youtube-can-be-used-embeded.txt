<p>In a site I have multiple Youtube embedded videos, (with permission) at that time.</p>
<p>Later, after 1-2 years, some of the videos are marked as Youtube only, or are deleted from youtube.</p>
<p>I'm looking for a way to use python:
- to see which video from a list are still available, 
- which can be used embedded
- is a video or playlist</p>
<p>If a package exist, better.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos#properties" rel="nofollow noreferrer">youtube API</a> should return to you whether a video is embeddable or not:</p>
<p>Calling on their <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/#Videos" rel="nofollow noreferrer">video endpoint</a> should return you a representation that includes:</p>
<pre><code>  "status": {
    ...
    "embeddable": boolean,
    "publicStatsViewable": boolean
  },
</code></pre>
<p>You can use any library you like to hit the API like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">urllib</a></p>
