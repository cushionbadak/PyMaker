<p>I have 2 lists below and I need the user to enter the coin type from the list which I was able to do. After the bag weight is asked, but whatever coin type was entered first has to match the index of the bag weight but I cannot seem to do this as the code I typed has an error</p>
<pre><code>#this is the lists I am using 
coinType = [2, 1, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]
bagWeight = [12, 8.75, 8, 5, 6.5, 3.25, 7.12, 3.56]

#allows user to input coin type
print('£2, £1, 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p, 1p')
print (coinType)
flag="t"
while flag=="t":
    coinType1 = int(input('enter your coin type: '))
    if coinType1 in coinType:
        flag="n"

#allows user to input bag weight
print('12g, 8.75g, 8g, 5g, 6.5, 3.25g, 7.12g, 3.56g')
print (bagWeight)
flag="t"
while flag=="t":
    bagWeight1 = float(input('enter your bag weight: '))
#here I am trying to say that when a bagweight index doesn't match the cointype index a while loop will keep aking until the indexes match
if (bagWeight1[])!= (coinType1[]):
    flag="t"

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the list <code>index()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>if coinType1 in coinType:
    coin_index = coinType.index(coinType1)
</code></pre>
<p>Then later you can check if the bagWeight has the right index.</p>
<pre><code>if bagWeight1 in bagWeight:
    bag_index = bagWeight.index(bagWeight1)

if coin_index == bag_index:
    # Do Something

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The builtin <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zip()</a> might be helpful here, since you don't have to explicitly match indices. This is, of course, assuming that the lists are designed to match index-by-index (the coin in the first position goes <em>only</em> with the weight in the first position)</p>
<pre><code>types_weights = list(zip(coinType, bagWeight))
# [(2, 12), (1, 8.75)...]

coin_type = int(input("Pick a type"))

selections = [x for x in types_weights if x[0]==coin_type]

if not selections:
    raise ValueError("Wrong coin type!")

bag_weight = float(input("Pick a weight"))

selections = [x for x in selections if x[1]==bag_weight]

if not selections:
    raise ValueError("Wrong bag weight!")

<span class="comment-copy">What is the exact error message and on what line is it occurring?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like your second <code>while</code> loop has no exit condition, and the error looks like just a <code>SyntaxError</code> against the last <code>if</code> statement. So, with that in mind, do the bagweights and coinTypes correspond? i.e.: bagweight 12 goes <i>only</i> with cointype 2 in the first position?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes that is true</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the error message is a syntax error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The syntax error is probably because you are trying to slice a float. <code>bagWeight[]</code> doesn't make any sense because <code>bagWeight</code> is a float not a list or array. (Even if it was a list you would need <code>[:]</code> for it to by syntactically okay).</span>
