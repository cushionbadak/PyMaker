<p>I'm trying to figure out why this isn't compiling(I'm getting a syntax error). This is a string that will be part of the code to an html page. I want to create i flight path variables, each named flightpathi. So flightpath0, flightpath1 and so forth. When using """+i+""" or any other variable inside triple quotations on other lines, this works. I know this is probably something pretty simple that I'm overlooking, but I'm stuck and I'd appreciate any help! </p>

<p>Triple quotes are for multiline comments in python. I would use <code>"var flightPath" + str(i)</code>. You may also want to look into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enumerate</a> for your loop. If you need the extra quotes as part of your string for some reason you need to escape them so they are not comments.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. And how can I escape them so they aren't comments ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Here is post about it. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6275762/escaping-quotes-in-string" title="escaping quotes in string">stackoverflow.com/questions/6275762/escaping-quotes-in-string</a> I would read the selected answer and the comments as there are some caveats when escaping quotes</span>
