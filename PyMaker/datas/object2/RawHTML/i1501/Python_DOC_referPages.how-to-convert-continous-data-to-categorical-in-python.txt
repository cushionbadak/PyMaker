<p>All,</p>
<p>My dataset looks like following, and I Would like to add one column which can convert my last column i.e Day_of_The_week to Mon, Tue, Wed.
Note: Day_of_the_week include 5 days : Mon,Tue,Wed,Thurs,Fri. I checked <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46659073/change-numerical-data-to-categorical-data-pandas">link</a> but couldn't figure out how to implement in my dataframe</p>

<p><strong>I would like to convert my pandas dataframe as below:</strong>

<p>Being a newbie to python,if you could provide explanation, that will be great!</p>

<h3><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#calendar.day_name" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>calendar.day_name</code></a> + <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.map.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pd.Series.map</code></a></h3>
<p>You can construct a dictionary and then map your integer series to a list of day strings:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
from calendar import day_name
from collections import deque

df = pd.DataFrame({'Day_of_the_week': [2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6]})

days = deque(day_name)
days.rotate(df['Day_of_the_week'].iat[0])  # rotate days
days_map = dict(enumerate(days))           # construct dictionary

df['Day_Factor'] = df['Day_of_the_week'].map(days_map)

print(df)

   Day_of_the_week Day_Factor
0                2     Monday
1                3    Tuesday
2                4  Wednesday
3                4  Wednesday
4                5   Thursday
5                6     Friday
6                6     Friday
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! The dictionary key's  assigned 0 to Friday. I would like to assign key 6 to Friday. Is there a way to do that ? I would like my dictionary to start with 2 as Monday and ends at Key 6- Friday.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@biggboss2019, Yes, as you can see that's what my logic does, you are rotating days by 2 days. Since the <code>day_name</code> has Monday at index 0, but you want it at index 2. To hardcode this, use <code>2</code> instead of <code>df['Day_of_the_week'].iat[0]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great. Thanks!!</span>
