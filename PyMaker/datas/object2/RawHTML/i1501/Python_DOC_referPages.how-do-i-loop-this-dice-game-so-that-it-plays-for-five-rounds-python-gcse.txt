<p>I'm currently working on my OCR GCSE Program. I'm a new developer and this is my most extensive project yet.</p>
<p>The basis for the code is there, the program is working as intended, however my brief asks that the program run 5 times over for five separate rounds.</p>
<p>I'm struggling to understand while loops, whenever I try to implement a while loop. The program can not go past the login system.</p>
<p>I need some help figuring out how to loop this program and any suggestions on how to improve and optimise the code would be greatly appreciated! :) - Jayode18</p>

# Dice game rules / To Do list
# - Dice total added to score. - DONE
# - if total = even + 10 to score - DONE
# - if total = odd - 5 to score - DONE
# - if roll = double roll + 1 die and add roll to score - Simple if statement. Check if dice1 == dice2 and if yes then roll a third dice - DONE
# - Score != &lt; 0 - DONE
# - Score after 5 rolls wins. - Learn while loops. IN PROGRESS 
# - if p1score == p2score roll 1 die and see who wins - Same as doubles. Just check scores after 5 rounds, and roll a third if need be. Repeat until win.
# Save all scores at the end of every round and add to finalScorep1 &amp; p2 variable. Compare these and whichever is higher, print winners name and highest roll.

<p>You may want to look at this:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html</a></p>
<p>The for statement will solve your problem! You just need to put all the code you want to be looped inside of it, like this:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(5):
    print('Number {}'.format(i))
</code></pre>
<p>In this example above, the programm output will be like:</p>
<pre><code>Number 0
Number 1
Number 2
Number 3
Number 4
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, the code was looped 5 times! And the variable i are the number of the iteration.</p>
<p>Hope I've helped!</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you need all those elif statements? You can use <code>score % 2</code> to check if a number is even or odd (<code>%</code> means modulo, meaning it will give the remainder when <code>score</code> is divided by <code>2</code> for the example, 1 when score is odd, 0 when score is even)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The login system should not even be part of the loop (unless you want the user to log in at the start of <i>every</i> round). While loops are a very basic concept, so it would be worthwhile to read a tutorial or a good Python book.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'll give that a go! Thanks very much! @Max</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, use functions! This avoids repetitive code; such as when you are writing to Player1_Data.txt and Player2_Data.txt. This makes your code less, easier to read and also helps you out when you need to loop the game; i.e. if you have your main game inside a function called <code>game()</code>, then you can just do <code>for i in range(5): game()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@meowgoesthedog. It isn't part of the loop. However for some reason, when I write a while loop, it seems to cut the program off after the player's sign in.</span>
