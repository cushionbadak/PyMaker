<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I need to remove items from a list in the following manner:
given two numbers:</p>
<pre><code>num1 = 2
num2 = 5
#These are arbitraty (can be different than 2 or 5) 
</code></pre>
<p>and the list:</p>
<pre><code>[[10, 10], [20, 20], [30, 30], [40, 40], [50, 50], [60, 60], [70, 70], [80, 80], [90, 90], [100, 100]]
</code></pre>
<p>I need to remove all items that are in between these two nums, such that the following output will be created:</p>
<pre><code>[[10, 10], [20, 20], [60, 60], [70, 70]]
</code></pre>
<p>so the 1st and 2nd numbers are kept, the 3rd, 4th, and 5th are removed, the 6th and 7th are kept, and the rest is removed</p>
<p>I've tried to create a certain loop that deletes items, but couldn't quite figure how to run over indexes.</p>
<p>thx for the help! </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You want to keep the first 2 out of 5 for every 5 items:</p>
<pre><code>data = [[10, 10], [20, 20], [30, 30], [40, 40], [50, 50], [60, 60], [70, 70],
        [80, 80], [90, 90], [100, 100]]

num1 = 2
num2 = 5  # num2 must be &gt; num1

new_data = [x for i,x in enumerate(data) if i%num2 &lt; num1 ]


print(new_data)
</code></pre>
<p>Output: </p>
<pre><code>[[10, 10], [20, 20], [60, 60], [70, 70]]
</code></pre>
<p>The trick is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate()</code></a> and modulo the given index of your original data by <code>num2</code> - you keep those that are less then <code>num1</code>.</p>
<pre><code>index :   0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, ...
i%num2:   0,1,2,3,4,0,1,2,3,4, ...
keep:     x x - - - x x - - -  ...
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm not sure exactly what you mean, but I'm assuming you mean this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete elements from <code>num1</code> to <code>num2</code></li>
<li>Delete elements after <code>num1 + num2</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Just use the <code>del</code> operator and list slicing:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = [[10, 10], [20, 20], [30, 30], [40, 40], [50, 50], [60, 60], [70, 70], [80, 80], [90, 90], [100, 100]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; num1, num2 = 2, 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = mylist[:num1 + num2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist
[[10, 10], [20, 20], [30, 30], [40, 40], [50, 50], [60, 60], [70, 70]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; del mylist[num1:num2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist
[[10, 10], [20, 20], [60, 60], [70, 70]]

<span class="comment-copy">Please show what your attempt was. As it stands, this is too broad; your requirement seems completely arbitrary</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you wanted to remove between 2 and 5, so why elements beyond 7th are removed? please clarify</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are plenty of prior questions here that demonstrate removing items from a list, or building a new list from slices of an old one.  Please show the failing code and how the prior answers don't solve your problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thx! can you explain why (0,1)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>in (0,1)</code> actually just means less than 2. The solution could be made better by replacing <code>if i%num2 in (0,1)</code> by <code>if i%num2 &lt; num1</code>. Right now, this solution doesn't update if you change <code>num1</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tomothy32 very true points, thanks for telling</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PatrickArtner Just letting you know, assuming this is a typo, it says <code>if i%num2 in &lt; num1</code> right now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@python_beginner  0 and 1 are below 2 - this worked(ish) for num1=2 - fixed it with input from tommy - it's better to use like he suggested</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey! I actually ment to keep 2 files out of 5, for every 5 items @Tomothy32</span>
