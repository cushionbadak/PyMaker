<p>Could somebody kindly let me know why is there a <code>SyntaxError</code>? I use macOS Mojave and have installed <code>IDLE</code> version 3.7.1.</p>
<pre><code>if name == 'Alice':
    print('Hi, Alice.')

    elif age &lt; 12:
        print('You are not Alice, kiddo.')

        elif age &gt; 2000:
            print('Unlike you, Alice is not undead, immortal vampire.')

            elif age &gt; 100:
            print('You are not Alice, grannie.')
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Indentation is wrong:</p>
<pre><code>name = input('whats your name? ')
age = int(input('whats your age? '))
if name == 'Alice':

    print('You are not Alice, kiddo.')

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>'elif' should have the same indent as the 'if'</p>
<p>remove white space before your elif</p>
<pre><code>if test expression:
    Body of if
elif test expression:
    Body of elif
else:
    Body of else

<span class="comment-copy">@GauthamM His question directly pertains to the incorrect formatting - editing it would make the question useless.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@connectyourcharger Actually that was what I meant and not the formatting of the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@GauthamM Yes, but changing the code format to be correct would not inform the user of his mistake. He/she should follow the answers posted below.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you Joe Iddon for the help. But the SyntaxError is still there. This time in line 3 of the code. More specifically the colon is being highlighted in red.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, my bad, I missed a bracket on line 2. Please try again with the updated version...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It works now Joe. Just started learning how to code. Thank you so much for the help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem. Enjoy!</span>
