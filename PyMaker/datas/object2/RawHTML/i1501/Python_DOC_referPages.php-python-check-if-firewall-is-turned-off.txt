<p>is it possible to write a PHP script that checks if the PC's firewall is disabled and then output yes/no into a checkbox on the webpage? (Hosting my own web server using WAMP)</p>
<p>Currently what i have in mind is create a .bat file that checks if firewall is turned off
using:</p>
<pre><code>netsh advfirewall show public
</code></pre>
<p>then check if the State shown on CMD is On / OFF and return results to the web-page's checkbox. 
Thing is i have no idea how do i go about doing the check state and return results.</p>
<p>Please advise. Also open to other ideas / solutions that could provide similar results.</p>
<p>PS: Am a beginner at PHP scripting and only started learning python today and project is due in 3 weeks. Also would be nice if you could link full code solutions if you know of any. I learn faster through referencing.</p>

<p>You can use this command to get only the status of the public profile :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"netsh advfirewall show public state"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This command can be used in a python script with the subprocess module :</p>
<p><code>result = subprocess.check_output(["netsh", "advfirewall", "show ", "allprofiles", "state"].decode('utf-8')</code></p>
<p>The result will be a string, using regex you will be able to get the value from it.</p>

<p>Example of regex : </p>
<pre><code>status = re.search('state[ ]*([A-Za-z])*', result).group(1)
</code></pre>
