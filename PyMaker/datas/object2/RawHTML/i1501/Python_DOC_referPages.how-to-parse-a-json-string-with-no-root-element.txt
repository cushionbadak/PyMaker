<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a JSON file like below:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "name":"A",
  "age":19
}
{
  "name":"B",
  "age":20
}
</code></pre>
<p>So basically the file contains a list of people. </p>
<p>I tried to use <code>json.loads(str_content)</code> in Python 3, but it returned the error of <code>json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Extra data:</code>.</p>
<p>I checked with an online JSON parser (<a href="http://json.parser.online.fr" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://json.parser.online.fr</a>) and it told me the same problem.</p>
<p>How to parse a JSON file without a root element but a list of JSON objects?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The issue is that the string you are trying to parse is not a valid JSON document. It is  actually a concatenation of JSON documents. So the simple <code>json.loads()</code> will  not work.</p>
<p>You can use instead something based on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.JSONDecoder.raw_decode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.JSONDecoder.raw_decode</a> . E.g: (code is a bit ugly but the logic should be clear):</p>
<pre><code>import json

s = """{
  "name":"A",
  "age":19
}
{
  "name":"B",
  "age":20
}"""

def iter_jsons(s):
    decoder = json.JSONDecoder()

    i = 0
    while True:
        doc, i2 = decoder.raw_decode(s[i:].strip())
        yield doc
        if i == i2:
            break
        i= i2

print(list(iter_jsons(s)))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">There is a syntax error in <code>age:20</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem is you <i>don't</i> have a JSON file; what's creating that file, could it be modified to have a single root array?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Chirag thanks, I modified it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jonrsharpe I think the file is created from MongoDB. In fact I god a BSON file, then I converted it to JSON.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is it stored in multi-line json? Like this <code>{"name":"A","age":19} {"name":"B","age":20}</code> Each in new line</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If there are no nested dicts you could simply look for the closing brace and parse up to that point.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I can't find anything in the json standard that indicates that a JSON document must have a root element.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TomasZubiri It is not explicitly stated as text in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-2</a> , but the ABNF indicates that a JSON-text is a SINGLE value</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TomasZubiri: I believe the standard indicates that a JSON document must either be a single JSON object enclosed in <code>{</code>, <code>}</code> brackets or a comma delimited list of them enclosed in <code>[</code>, <code>]</code> brackets. This answer looks like a very clever workaround allowing this non-compliant input to be decoded into the list it should have been in the first place.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tripleee: that is correct, but I'd rather not assume anything about the content I am trying to parse.</span>
