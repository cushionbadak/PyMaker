<p>I have 2 VM sessions. </p>
<p>In the VM session A, the script won't run right if I type python </p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8BvXu.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">if I don't put python3 the error I get </a></p>
<p>but if I type python3  it's fine. </p>
<p>When I move this script to my other VM session B, and I try to run it, it is spitting out (what I think) are issues with quotes. (VM B is a virtualized environment and I don't usually have to type python3  .. but I did it both ways here and it still fails.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/E2vmF.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the error I get in VMWare B no matter what I do</a></p>
<p>VM A is running python Python 2.7.15rc1 -- at least if I type python on the terminal it says that ... which confuses me why I type python3 to get it to run. I see code that is using some of the new formatting in python strings.</p>
<p>VM B is running Python 3.5.2.</p>
<p>Can someone help, I am a rookie here big time ... so appreciate it!</p>

<p>Your script uses f-strings (the <code>f"\t- {house_1[0]} sq feet"</code> thing), which were only added to Python in version 3.6.  You need to either upgrade the Python 3 version on VM B or else rewrite your code to no longer use f-strings.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your errors are not images, they are text. Please copy them as such in your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On your VM A <code>python</code> is running Python 2.7 and <code>python3</code> is running some version of Python 3.x.  The two are not comparable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">f-strings were introduced in Python 3.6 but you're running Python 3.5 on VMWare B.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">re: rewriting, just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.format()</code></a> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I can't believe I missed that one ... grrrrr ... thanks!</span>
