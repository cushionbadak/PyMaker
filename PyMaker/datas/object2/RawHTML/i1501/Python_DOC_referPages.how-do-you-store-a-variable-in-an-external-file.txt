<p>You can try this kind of code.</p>
<pre><code>        with open(file, "a") as f:
            f.write("write your content" + "\n")
</code></pre>
<p>But there are plenty of pages describing how to write content into files. Did you try these examples?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please have a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask</a> - most importantly it's missing what you have tried yourself so far and where exactly you ran into a problem</span>

<span class="comment-copy">You don't need to close the file manually. <code>with</code> does that for you.</span>
