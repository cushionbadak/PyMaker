<p>I am using anaconda on mac and I am wondering whether there is a way to clear my python command history. Specifically, upon calling <code>python</code> in terminal, I wanted to clear anything I typed before here.</p>

<p>Assuming you want to clear the command history Python goes through when you hit the up and down arrow keys, that history is managed by either the GNU readline library or libedit, depending on your system. The Python <code>readline</code> module is the Python-level interface to the underlying library (even if that library is libedit), and on systems where the underlying library supports it, you can clear the history with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/readline.html#readline.clear_history" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>readline.clear_history</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import readline
&gt;&gt;&gt; readline.clear_history()
</code></pre>
<p>I do not know if the library on your Mac supports it.</p>

<p>Escape sequence?</p>
<pre><code>print(chr(27) + "[2J")
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively</p>
<pre><code>import os
os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use subprocess.call() from the standard library subprocess module to send the reset command to the terminal which will reinitialize the terminal and in effect do something similar to clear but also clear the scrollback history.</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
subprocess.call('reset')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you asking how to clear the display of previously entered commands and output, or how to clear the command history that Python goes through when you hit the up arrow key?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This will only clear my python history in this interactive session but not the previous ones. Suppose you called python, did some python script, exited, and called python again, when you press up on your keyboard, you should be able to see the python history and that is what I was trying to clear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But this only clears my bash command history but not my python history?</span>
