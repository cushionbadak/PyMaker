<p>I'm trying to make GUI in pyqt5 with only a button and a simple recursive drawing</p>
<p>what're the ideal tools for this task? 
I tried <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Turtle</a> which is simple and get the job done but I don't know how to embed the graphics inside pyqt it opens a different window</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>turtle</code> is built on top of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tkinter</a>. <code>tkinter</code> and <code>pyqt5</code>
each use their own event loop. I don't think it is possible (or at least, it
wouldn't be very easy) to mix two different GUI toolkits (<code>tkinter</code> and <code>pyqt5</code>)
in one app.</p>
<p>If you want to use <code>turtle</code>, you should build the GUI with <code>tkinter</code> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14514923/190597">embed a <code>RawTurtle</code> in a canvas</a>.</p>
<p>Or, alternatively, build the GUI with <code>pyqt5</code>, and make the <a href="http://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/painting/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">drawing with, perhaps, a QPen</a>.</p>
