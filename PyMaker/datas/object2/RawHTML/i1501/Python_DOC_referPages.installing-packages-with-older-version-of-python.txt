<p>I have Python 3.7, which currently doesn't support Tensorflow.</p>
<p>So I installed Python 3.6.7, went to the command line and typed in <code>py -m pip install tensorflow</code>, and still got the same error:</p>
<p><code>Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow (from versions: ). No matching distribution found for tensorflow</code></p>
<p>What can I do ensure that I'm trying to install Tensorflow using Python 3.6.7?</p>

<p>Browsing the documentation: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html</a></p>
<p>The solution is to invoke version 3.6 by specifying it as follows:</p>
<p><code>py -3.6 -m pip install tensorflow</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure that <code>py</code> command links to the Python 3.6.7?</span>
