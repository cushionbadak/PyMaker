<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to get url from object data, but it isn't right. This program has stopped on line 4. Code is under.</p>
<p>My code:</p>
<pre><code>    import requests

    gifs = str(requests.get("https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random? 
    api_key=APIKEY"))
    dump = json.dumps(gifs)
    json.loads(dump['data']['url'])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your description is not clear enough. You expect to read a json and select a field that brings you something?
I recommend you check this section of <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/#json-response-content" rel="nofollow noreferrer">requests quickstart guide</a> this i suspect you want to read the data to json and extract from some fields.
Maybe something like this might help:</p>
<pre><code>r = requests.get('http://whatever.com')  
url = r.json()['url']
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Assuming you use the standard Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dumps" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json.dumps</code></a> function, it returns a <i>string</i> and not any kind of JSON "object" or dictionary.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, please don't put "tags" in the title, the actual tags are enough.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Make sure you post enough code that we can copy and run by ourselves. (Hint: your code does not.)</span>
