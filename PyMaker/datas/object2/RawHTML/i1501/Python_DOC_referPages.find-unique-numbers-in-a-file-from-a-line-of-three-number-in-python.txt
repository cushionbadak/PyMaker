<p>I read a file in python, which contains in each line 2 integer numbers and 1 real.
How can i find in <strong>python</strong> the number of unique number from the 2 first integer number from all the file (except real)? </p>
<p>eg file</p>
<pre><code>1 2 3.3
11 22 33.3
111 222 333.3
11 22 33.3
114 224 334.4
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the result should be 8.</p>
<p>UPDATE
this is my code</p>
<pre><code>with open('test.txt','r') as f:
    for line in f:
        for word in line.split():
           print(word)
</code></pre>
<p>How can I determine not to consider the <strong>real</strong> number and after i can do <strong>count</strong> <strong>distinct</strong> number from the first <strong>two integer</strong> in each line</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set</a> function to generate a unique set. For example:</p>
<pre><code>fileName = 'test.txt'
with open(fileName, 'r') as f:
    unique = set()
    for line in f.readlines():
        unique = unique | set(line.split()[:2])
print(unique)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>{'114', '11', '22', '111', '2', '224', '222', '1'}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>After reading your file, you can get the set of every flattened row slices <code>[:2]</code>, then get the length:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import chain

with open('numbers.txt') as file:
    unique = len(set(chain.from_iterable(x.split()[:2] for x in file)))
    print(unique)

# 8
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You read in the file line by line, split the line at spaces using <code>split()</code> . You convert the resulting strings into numbers, feed them into a set and check how big the set gets. What exactly is your problem?</span>
