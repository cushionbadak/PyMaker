<p>Below is  my code. My understanding is my pattern says you must meet car and pet is oprtion . i.e check for word car and a carpet both .Now re.search match carpet which is fine.But re.finall output should be ['carpet', 'car'], But it is showing me ['pet', ''] .Please let me know where i am incorrect ?</p>
<pre><code>import re
string = "carpet and car"
pattern = r'car(pet)?'
print(re.search(pattern, string))
print(re.findall(pattern, string))
</code></pre>
<p>Here is output of code:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 6), match='carpet'&gt;
['pet', '']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use </p>
<pre><code>pattern = r'car(?:pet)?'
</code></pre>
<p>instead. The <code>?:</code> makes the group non-capturing (see the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regex syntax docs</a>) which makes all the difference to <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>findall</code></a> as it returns a list of the capturing groups if such are present in your pattern:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall(pattern, "carpet and car")
['carpet', 'car']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The reason is mentioned in <code>re</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation of <code>findall()</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of
  strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned
  in the order found. <strong>If one or more groups are present in the pattern,
  return a list of groups</strong>; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern
  has more than one group. <strong>Empty matches are included in the result</strong>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If i use pattern = 'car[p]?[e]?[t]?' then i am able to get my answer . ['carpet', 'car'] But i am still not able to understand why pattern = r'car(pet)?'  is not giving me result in re.findall not shoing me   ['carpet', 'car']</span>
