<p>I need to extract a zip file in RAM with my python script.
I have searched about Ramdisk in linux and I have some experiences in using Ramdisk.
It's Ok for me but it has a big problem.
Everyone who access my directories can see the unzipped file that I extracted them there (in Mounted Ramdisk), I need to access those unzipped files but it is necessary that only my python script can read and write file in RAM.
Do you have a better way for my program? Or a solution for this problem?
Thanks.</p>
<p>edit:
It has to be possible to interact with extracted files like normal files in a directory.
not just open and read them.</p>

<p>I'd create a secure temporary directory under <code>/dev/shm</code> and then extract the zip file into that. Due to its unpredictable name and tight permissions, only your user will be able to interact with it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The only way you would be able to "interact" with the extracted files outside of the python program is if they're placed on a ramdisk. Python does not come with software to create one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I can run os commands by my python program to create RamDisk, but I want only my python script access those files.</span>
