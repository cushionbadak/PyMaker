<p>In Ubuntu you can install package python3-mock. mock library has been added to Python 3.3 (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0417/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0417/</a>).
What is a difference between these libraries? Which one is recommended to use?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>unittest.mock</code> is recommended if you are using python 3.3 or newer.</p>
<p>I think <code>python3-mock</code> is the same as the version on pypi:
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/mock/#description" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pypi.org/project/mock/#description</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>mock is now part of the Python standard library, available as unittest.mock in Python 3.3 onwards.</p>
<p>This package contains a rolling backport of the standard library mock code compatible with Python 2.6 and up, and 3.3 and up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's actually a backport for old Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Depends on which python version you are using in your project.</p>
<p>For Python versions &lt; 3.3 you should install mock lib.</p>
<p>For others else, including 3.3, you don't need because it were incorporated to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">standard lib</a>.</p>
