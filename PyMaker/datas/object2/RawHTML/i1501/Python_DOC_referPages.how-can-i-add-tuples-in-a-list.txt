<p>Let's say I have a list with tuples in it.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<p><code>listnum = [(12,18),(12,20)]</code></p>
<p>Is there a way I can add what is in the tuples and make <code>listnum</code> into:</p>
<p><code>listnum = [30,32]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First, you should be more specific of what you expect.
If you want your list to be the sum of the numbers in the tuples, here's what you can do:</p>
<pre><code>listnum = [sum(x) for x in listnum]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try this</p>
<pre><code>listnum = [(12,18),(12,20)]
required_list = []
for i in range (0, len(listnum)):
    required_list.append(sum(list(listnum[i])))
</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use list comprehensions to do this:</p>
<pre><code>listnum = [(12,18), (12,20)]
res = [x + y for x, y in listnum]
print(res)
[30, 32]
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>@D.SuperFireball. Here's a way to solve your problem:</p>
<pre><code>listnum = [(12,18),(12,20)] 
listnum = [x[0] + x[1] for x in listnum]

# result:
# print(listnum)
# [30, 32]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>listnum = [sum(x) for x in listnum]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Yep, there is a way. What was your approach and what was the issue with it? Do you have errors?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't even have a start. I realized sum() wouldn't work. If you know the way please let me know.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">In what way would <code>sum</code> not work? (Sure, <code>sum(listnum)</code> isn't what you want, but can't you think of <i>some</i> way to apply <code>sum</code> to the problem?)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is exactly what I need! Thank you for the feedback aswell!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This was amazing! Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alternatively, if you have access to numpy, and you need some more flexibility for the number of tuples in your list of numbers, you can convert to numpy array and sum:     l = numpy.asarray(listnum)     res = l.sum(axis=-1)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This returned an empty list for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This also worked.</span>
