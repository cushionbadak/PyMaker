<p>I am a newbie in python. I have a problem, how do we import a .txt file to python?
I have a .txt file with so many texts inside it for me to analyze with the NLTK. 
Can you tell me how to start to analyze the texts? 
Thank you in advance</p>

<p>As an example, if you have a text file <code>file.txt</code> with each sentence on a separate line, such as</p>
<pre><code>This is a Larch.
Your father was a hamster and your mother smelled of elderberries.
</code></pre>
<p>Then you could load such a file in Python via</p>
<pre><code>f_in = open('file.txt', 'r')
sentences = f_in.readlines()
f_in.close()  # make sure to close the file so other programs can use it
</code></pre>
<p>Edit: to include the great suggestion in the comments you could (and should) use the Python context manager, <code>with</code>.</p>
<p>The above code block is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>with open('file.txt', 'r') as f_in:
    sentences = f_in.readlines()
</code></pre>
<p>with the added benefit that you don't need to call <code>f_in.close()</code>. This type of structure is used ubiquitously in Python and is well worth getting used to.</p>
