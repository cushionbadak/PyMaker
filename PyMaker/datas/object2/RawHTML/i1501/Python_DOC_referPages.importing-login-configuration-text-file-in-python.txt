<p>I'm new to Python, looked unsuccessfully for answers in previous posts. Hoping you can help me.</p>
<p>I'm trying to use a script I copied off of this <a href="https://qxf2.com/blog/ssh-using-python-paramiko/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Said script automates the process of starting SSH sessions on a given remote system and running commands on that system. </p>
<p>It imports a <code>configuration file</code>, from the import statement below I assume named <code>conf</code>, that supplies the script with login credentials, file paths, etc.</p>
<pre><code>from conf import ssh_conf as conf_file
</code></pre>
<p>My issue is I am not sure how the conf file is formatted and it wasn't provided in the blog post. From the import statement I assume the file is named <code>conf.py</code> and the it has <code>sections</code>, one of them named <code>ssh_conf</code></p>
<p>Can anyone describe how was that file formatted?</p>
<p>Gratefully,</p>

<p>There are not really sections like that.</p>
<p>If <code>conf.py</code> was a file, then this <em>could</em> be made to work, by making ssh_conf a <code>class</code> within <code>conf.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>class ssh_conf():
    HOST="www.example.com"
</code></pre>
<p>But that's kind of nasty and feels like pointless abuse of classes.</p>
<p>My guess is that <code>conf</code> is actually a <strong>package</strong>. That is to say, a directory called <code>conf</code> containing a (empty) file called <code>__init__.py</code> and a number of other files, any of which can be imported from <code>conf</code>. One of these files would be called <code>ssh_conf.py</code> and that would contain things like:</p>
<pre><code>HOST="www.example.com"
</code></pre>
<p>The overall structure looks like:</p>
<pre><code>MyProject/
|-- my_application.py
`-- conf/
    |-- __init__.py
    `-- ssh_conf.py
</code></pre>
<p>If you aren't familiar with packages, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the official documentation</a> is a good place to start.</p>
