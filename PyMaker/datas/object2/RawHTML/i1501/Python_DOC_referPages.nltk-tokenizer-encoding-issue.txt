<p>After tokenizing, my sentence contains many weird characters. How can I remove them?
This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>def summary(filename, method):
    list_names = glob.glob(filename)
    orginal_data = []
    topic_data = []
    print(list_names)
    for file_name in list_names:
        article = []
        article_temp = io.open(file_name,"r", encoding = "utf-8-sig").readlines()
        for line in article_temp:
            print(line)
            if (line.strip()):
                tokenizer =nltk.data.load('tokenizers/punkt/english.pickle')
                sentences = tokenizer.tokenize(line)
                print(sentences)
                article = article + sentences
        orginal_data.append(article)
        topic_data.append(preprocess_data(article))
    if (method == "orig"):
        summary = generate_summary_origin(topic_data, 100, orginal_data)
    elif (method == "best-avg"):
        summary = generate_summary_best_avg(topic_data, 100, orginal_data)
    else:
        summary = generate_summary_simplified(topic_data, 100, orginal_data)
    return summary
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>print(line)</code> prints a line of a txt. And <code>print(sentences)</code> prints the tokenized sentences in the line.</p>
<p>But sometimes the sentences contains weird characters after nltk's processing.</p>

<p>Like above example, where is the <code>\xa0</code> and <code>\xa0T</code> from?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>x = u'Assaly, who is a fan of both Pusha T and Drake, said he and his friends wondered if people in\xa0the crowd might boo Pusha\xa0T during the show, but said he never imagined actual violence would take place.'

# method 1 
x.replace('\xa0', ' ')

# method 2
import unicodedata
unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', x)

print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">\xa0 is an unicode character representing a <a href="http://www.codetable.net/hex/a0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">no-break space</a>. Your original text probably contains part UTF-8 encoding, part unicode encoding. Try to re-encode your original text file to UTF-8.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, the second method works</span>
