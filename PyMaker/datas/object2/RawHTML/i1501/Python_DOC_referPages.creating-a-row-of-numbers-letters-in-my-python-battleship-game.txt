<p>I am trying to get my grid to display like this:</p>
<pre><code> 1 2 3 4   
A- - - -  
B- - - -  
C- - - -  
D- - - -  
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried various ways of attempting this but I cannot seem to get it working. Would anyone have any suggestions? </p>
<p>Also in my login the while loop seems to be stuck. I put in a break a few times but again cant seem to get it working correctly. Any help is greatly appreciated! </p>

<p>Here's how to print your board with column numbers and row letters. We can use <code>.join</code> to print the column headers, just like you print the row data. And we can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a> to loop over the row letters &amp; row data in parallel. </p>
<pre><code># Building the gameboard
board = []
for x in range(5):
    board.append(["-"] * 5)

def print_board(board):
    print(" ", " ".join("12345"))
    for letter, row in zip("ABCDE", board):
        print(letter, " ".join(row))

print_board(board)

<pre><code>  1 2 3 4 5
A - - - - -
B - - - - -
C - - - - -
D - - - - -
E - - - - -

<span class="comment-copy">Questions on Stack Overflow should have a single question. That makes them more useful for future readers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much for that!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AoifeEllenRyan And you should separate the stuff out about the password loop and ask a fresh question. Although at this stage, that password stuff doesn't do much, since your program doesn't save the passwords on disk, and you only allow the user to play a single game.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">im working on adding sqlite at the minute to save the data. Hoping to add a win counter and highscore function also! This is only my first python project so struggling big time! Thanks so much for the help!</span>
