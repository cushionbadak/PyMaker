<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm new in python and wanted to know how I can set up a function to accept a file as a parameter but then the output should produce it inn reversed lines </p>
<p>for example, if the text file contained the following:</p>
<pre><code>"Jack and Jill went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water
jack fell down and broke his crown"
</code></pre>
<p>The output should be </p>
<pre><code>"to fetch a pail of water
jack fell down and broke his crown 
Jack and Jill went up the hill"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>Code</strong></p>
<pre><code>with open('test.txt', 'r') as fr, open('test_out.txt', 'w') as fw:
    content = fr.readlines()
    for item in content[::-1]:
        fw.write("%s\n" % item.rstrip('\n'))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Input File</strong></p>
<pre><code>Jack and Jill went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water
jack fell down and broke his crown
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output File</strong></p>
<pre><code>jack fell down and broke his crown
to fetch a pail of water
Jack and Jill went up the hill
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Adding to the first solution, you can also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reversed" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>reversed()</code></a> here:</p>
<pre><code>with open("example.txt") as fp, open("output.txt", mode="w") as fw:
    for line in reversed(fp.readlines()):
        fw.write(line.rstrip() + "\n")
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Shouldn't <code>jack fell down and broke his crown</code> be the 1st line in your output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is not an answer, but you might consider using command line tool <code>tac</code> from <code>coreutils</code>. It does exactly what you want, but in command line (or you popen the process). If you need python, then file_out.write(file_in.redlines().reverse()).</span>
