<p>This was a project that i have been doing in computer science which I have now finished if anyone has any suggestions on how I could make it better they will appreciated alot so please suggest how I can improve it. Also It would be very helpful to me if you could rewrite the parts of my code that need improving or are wrong step by step so I can understand it better</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<span class="comment-copy">ok then thanks for telling me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please ... read the posting rules over there first.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">First thing to improve: use loops, functions and more strucure. Read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a>  parts about functions and loops. Don't write/read from/to files all over the place - do it at start and end -store data in data structures to use throughout the game. write the scores last</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok then thanks for telling me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for telling me this i have a question, how would you make it so that if the two rolls added up to a negative number make the score 0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also I want it so that if a player rolled 5 and 3, the total is 8 which is even so its suppose to add 10 points to the 8 points which is 18</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@colkat406 how should adding up 2 numbers that are positiv end up wit somethjing negative?  look into the <code>def throw_dice(key):</code> function - it does all the dice throwing. The <code>key</code> rules to which player it isapplied - all the rest are simle if/else conditions. You would need to change them to fit your needs.</span>
