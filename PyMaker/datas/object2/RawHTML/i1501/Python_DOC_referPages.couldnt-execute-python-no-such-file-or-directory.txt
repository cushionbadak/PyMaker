<p>Depending on your Python's version, it may use py as command. You should try using 'py' instead of 'python'.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Provide the full path to the python exe instead of relying on PATH.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks like the Python executable isn't in a directory that is on your <code>PATH</code> environment variable. Or maybe you've not installed it at all; the result would look the same at this point.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Paxz or just add Python executable to <code>PATH</code> if it was supposed to be there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks a lot :) the problem is fixed</span>
