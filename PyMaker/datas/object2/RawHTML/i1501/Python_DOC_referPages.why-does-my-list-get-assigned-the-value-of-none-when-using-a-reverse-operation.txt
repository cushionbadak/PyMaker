<p>I am new to python and I am trying to create a program the will tell a user if the word they enter is a palindrome. When I execute my code, it outputs the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please enter a word. I will tell you if that word is a palindrome or not: <em>hannah</em></p>
<p>Please enter a word. I will tell you if that word is a palindrome or not: hannah
  This word is not a palindrome</p>
<p><strong>None</strong>['n', 'a', 'h']</p>
<p>Process finished with exit code 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Im not sure why the list within cal_tableRev is saving as "none". Any ideas on how I might fix this would be a great help!</p>
<pre><code>user_input = input("Please enter a word. I will tell you if that word is a palindrome or not: ").lower()
cal_table1 = []
cal_table2 = []


for letter in user_input:
    cal_table1.append(letter)

inputSize = len(cal_table1)
Calsize = inputSize / 2

if inputSize % 2 != 0:
    print("The word has an odd number of letters and, therefore, it is not a palindrome. Please enter a new word")

for letters in cal_table1[0:int(Calsize)]:
    cal_table2.append(letters)

cal_tableRev = str(cal_table2.reverse())

frontHalf = str(cal_tableRev)
backHalf = str(cal_table2)
calulated_word = str(frontHalf) + str(backHalf)

if user_input == calulated_word:
    print("This word is a palindrome")
else:
    print("This word is not a palindrome")

print(calulated_word)

<p>It looks like you are doing a lot of work python can make easier for you.  Take a look at these commands I ran in a python console:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; word='tenet'
&gt;&gt;&gt; backwards=''.join(reversed(word))
&gt;&gt;&gt; word == backwards
True

&gt;&gt;&gt; word='pizza'
&gt;&gt;&gt; backwards=''.join(reversed(word))
&gt;&gt;&gt; word == backwards
False

&gt;&gt;&gt; word
'pizza'
&gt;&gt;&gt; backwards
'azzip'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The function reverse() reverses a given list but returns the value None which you then assigned to cal_tableRev
try:</p>
<pre><code>cal_tableRev = copy.deepcopy(cal_table2)
cal_tableRev.reverse() #reversing without assigning the None value
cal_tableRev=str(cal_tableRev)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Made the correction, sorry the formatting was wrong in my post but was correct in my IDE when I was attempting to run the script.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also aren't words like <code>wow</code> and <code>tenet</code> palindromes even though the contain a odd number of letters?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Correct, but for the purpose of this program, I only want to allow words with even numbers. Sorry if its a bit misleading..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Be wary that <code>list.reverse()</code>doesn't return anything as it reverse the list in place (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mutable-sequence-types</a>)</span>
