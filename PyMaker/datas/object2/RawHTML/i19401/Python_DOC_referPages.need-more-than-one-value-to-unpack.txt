<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am currently working on a program that splits a flat file at the '|' symbol and seperates each entity into a new object defined in the code. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>    results = 0
    searchphrase = input("Search: ")
    with open('file.dat', 'r', encoding='utf8') as info_1:
        for line in info_1:
            a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m = line.split('|')
            if searchphrase in a:
                results +=1
                print(results, a + '|' + b + '|' + c etc.)
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT 1</p>
<p>This is the version of the program that does not work and gives me the error message <code>need more than 1 value to unpack</code>, resolving to the <code>a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m = line.split('|')</code> line.</p>
<p>The format of the data from the file I am calling is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a reason it would interpret that as a single line and not spread each entity into its own object? The program runs fine when I do it like this:</p>
<pre><code>results = 0
searchphrase = input("Search: ")
with open('file.ext', 'r', encoding='utf8') as info_1:
    for line in info_1:
        a = line.split('|')
        if searchphrase in a:
            results +=1
            print(results, a)
</code></pre>
<p>But I want people to be able to search for information based on specific columns of the file (i.e search a for x, search d for y, etc.). How would I go about doing that?</p>

<p>You probably have <em>empty lines</em> in your input. Skip these:</p>
<pre><code>for line in info_1:
    if not line.strip(): continue
</code></pre>
<p>but you probably want to use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow"><code>csv</code> module</a> instead:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

for row in csv.reader(open('file.dat', newlines=''), delimiter='|'):
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Aside: There is a standard-library module specifically designed to aid you with tasks like this: <a href="http://docs.python.org/3.1/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3.1/library/csv.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Aside: it's unlikely that a line like <code>a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m = something</code> is the best way to do whatever it is you're trying to do.  Not impossible, but pretty unlikely.  You're far better off using a dict or referring to the columns by indexing into a list or tuple or some combination of those.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So with the csv module, how would that change the structure of the code? Do i still need to specify that a, b, c, d, e, f = line.split('|')?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ErikG.: You could use <code>a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m = row</code> if you <i>have</i> to.</span>
