<span class="comment-copy">Based on what do you want to filter the characters? Do you only want to preserve ASCII?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@root, yes I just want to preserve the ascii</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But the string you have shown in example has \\u03c0 not \u03c0...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's just how its printed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also curious why you wrote <code>\` but not </code>`, isn't `` outputs the same thing with your code ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This also strips characters such as <code>ü, ä, ö</code> etc, which is not desired in most of the cases.</span>
