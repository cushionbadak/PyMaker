<p>I was reading the Python docs earlier, and I discovered <code>&lt;&gt;</code>. How exactly does this differ from <code>!=</code>? As far as I can tell, the only difference is that <code>&lt;&gt;</code> won't work with strings. Does <code>&lt;&gt;</code> do something special that <code>!=</code> doesn't, or is there a reason I hadn't heard about it for over two years?</p>

<p><code>&lt;&gt;</code> is a remnant of the past. Quoting the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow">docs</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>!= can also be written &lt;&gt;, but this is an obsolete usage kept for backwards compatibility only. New code should always use !=.</code></p>

<p>Also, worth noting that Python 3 doesn't support <code>&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><code>&lt;&gt;</code> <em>exactly the same thing</em> as <code>!=</code>, for strings or any other type:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'a' &lt;&gt; 'b'
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'a' != 'b'
True
</code></pre>
<p>However, <code>&lt;&gt;</code> is deprecated. It has been <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html#removed-syntax" rel="nofollow">removed from Python 3</a>. Always use <code>!=</code> instead.</p>

<p>Operator <code>&lt;&gt;</code> is simply the deprecated verision of <code>!=</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Don't use <code>&lt;&gt;</code>. it was removed from python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hint when searching for operators before you ask, enclose the operators in double quotes, so a search looks like <code>[python] "!=" "&lt;&gt;"</code>. These operator questions have always been asked before and will pop right up if searched correctly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is it only me, or does the blockquote only appear on mouseover?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it's the same for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, there's a <code>spoiler</code> class on it. I have not seen that around here in a while.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fixed it. Apparently, <code>!</code> is for spoilers :)</span>
