<p>The <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/crypt" rel="nofollow"><code>crypt</code> module</a> is an interface to the Unix <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/crypt" rel="nofollow"><code>crypt</code> library</a> which is used for encrypting Unix passwords. It is documented as not being available on Windows. It is not a general purpose cryptography library.</p>

<p>If all you're looking for is an implementation of <code>crypt(3)</code>, I've knocked up a pure-Python implementation <a href="https://gist.github.com/Cairnarvon/5075687" rel="nofollow">here</a>, ported from <a href="http://michael.dipperstein.com/crypt/index.html" rel="nofollow">this public domain C implementation</a>. It's pretty damn slow (about 2800 times slower than Python's built-in <code>crypt</code> on my machine, which is already about half the speed of OpenSSL's <code>DES_crypt</code>), but if you're just calculating the occasional hash, that shouldn't really be a problem.</p>
<p>Are you writing an imageboard, by any chance?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This probably means that Python was built without crypt support. I <i>guess</i> that crypt development files were missing. (name of the package varies depending on the OS).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ya that's what I figured because it has the crypt.py file there and it shows up under my Modules... If there isn't a solution in a while I think I'm just going to go down to Python 2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As casevh notes, the <code>crypt</code> module is documented as Unix only.  You won't find it in Python 2, either.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No I was writing a program to connect to my MySQL on my Website and I really needed transferred data to be secured on the computer (as a backup stored on the computer) because multiple have access to the MySQL server and my computer and some data shouldn't be shown.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might try collaborating/freshening up this one:  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fcrypt/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pypi.python.org/pypi/fcrypt</a></span>
