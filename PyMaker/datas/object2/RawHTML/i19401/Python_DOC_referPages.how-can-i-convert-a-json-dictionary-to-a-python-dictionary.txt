<p>I have a JSON file that only contains a JSON dictionary (example: <a href="http://www.collegeswimming.com/results/17172/event/4/" rel="nofollow">http://www.collegeswimming.com/results/17172/event/4/</a>). Is there any module in Python that will easily convert this into an object I can work with in Python?</p>

<p>That’s called JSON, by the way. It’s not JavaScript. Fittingly, the module is called <code>json</code>.</p>
<p>Try <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/json#json.loads"><code>json.loads</code></a>!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">json modules is in the standard lib.  <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/json.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">whoops that's embarrassing...I'll edit that and fix that. and thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, JSON does stand for "JavaScript Object Notation", and the point is that a JSON object is always valid (<code>eval</code>-able) source for a JavaScript object (but the reverse is not always true). Of course many people think that was a mistake, given all the security holes and other bugs caused by people using <code>eval</code> to parse JSON, or generating data that aren't JSON but still work with JS code, etc., but still, it's a bit misleading to say that it isn't a JavaScript object…</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You beat me to the punch.
