<p>I have two tables , TABLE1 AND TABLE2. One with just Project IDs and another with Project ID and Task ID. 
I want to iterate through TABLE1 and compare it to TABLE2 Projects IDs. If there is a common value, I want to attach the Task ID corresponding to that particular Project ID to TABLE1 Project ID.</p>
<p>The way I did this is as follows.</p>
<pre><code>for index,i in enumerate(TABLE1["ProjectID"]):

  if i in TABLE2["ProjectID"].values:

    TABLE1["TaskId"][index] =TABLE2["TaskId"].loc[TABLE2["TaskId"]==i].values[0]
  else:        
    print("Doesnt exist")
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a better way of doing this? It took me ages to do this, even if its just a few line of code!
Thankyou!</p>

<p>use <code>merge</code></p>
<pre><code>new_table = pd.merge(Table1,Table2,how='left',on='ProjectID')

<span class="comment-copy">Thankyou ! This works! But what about the situation when, I do not want to delete any of my data. For example, in the above example, I would like to put NA if the ProjectID is not found.</span>
