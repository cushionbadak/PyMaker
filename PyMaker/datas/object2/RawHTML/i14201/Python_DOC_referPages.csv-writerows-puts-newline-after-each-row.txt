<p>This is an example from the <em>O'Reilly Cookbook</em> (truncated dataset)</p>
<pre><code>headers = ['Symbol','Price','Date','Time','Change','Volume']

<p>the output file has a <code>\n</code> at the end of each line, and apparently one more at the end.  When I bring it into Excel, I get blank lines between each row.   The same if I open it with Notepad++.</p>
<p>But, if I <code>more</code> if from a command line, the <code>\n</code> don't show up.</p>
<p>I saw another Q&amp;A about a <code>\n</code> at the end of a file - but this one is about a <code>\n</code> at the end of each line.   (And I don't see why <code>more</code> doesn't give the <code>\n</code>.)</p>
<p>I plan to bring the file into OpenOffice Calc.</p>

<p>This problem occurs only with Python on Windows.</p>
<p>In Python v3, you need to add newline='' in the open call per:</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16271236/python-3-3-csv-writer-writes-extra-blank-rows">Python 3.3 CSV.Writer writes extra blank rows</a></p>
<p>On Python v2, you need to open the file as binary with "b" in your open() call before passing to csv</p>
<p>Changing the line </p>
<pre><code>with open('stocks2.csv','w') as f:
</code></pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre><code>with open('stocks2.csv','wb') as f:
</code></pre>
<p>will fix the problem</p>

</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I came across this issue on windows for Python 3. I tried changing newline parameter while opening file and it worked properly with <code>newline=''</code>. </p>
<p>Add <code>newline=''</code> to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">open()</a> method as follows:</p>
<pre><code>with open('stocks2.csv','w', newline='') as f:
    f_csv = csv.DictWriter(f, headers)
    f_csv.writeheader()
    f_csv.writerows(rows)
</code></pre>
<p>It will work as charm.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p>It's an extra carriage return, and this is a Windows-specific issue not related to Python 2/3 differences. If you open up your file in Notepad++ and enable <code>Show all characters</code>, you'll see the following:</p>
<pre><code>Symbol,Price,Date,Time,Change,Volume[CR]
[CR][LF]
AA,39.48,6/11/2007,9:36am,-0.18,181800[CR]
[CR][LF]
AIG,71.38,6/11/2007,9:36am,-0.15,195500[CR]
[CR][LF]
</code></pre>
<p>This is because Python on Windows is translating your line ending from <code>'\n'</code> to <code>'\r\n'</code>, while the <code>writerows()</code> function is already adding <code>'\r\n'</code> to the end of every line. What's happening:</p>
<ol>
<li>csv.writerows() writes the appropriate row of data, and then ends the line with <code>'\r\n'</code></li>
<li>Python's internal handling (because you're on Windows) sees the end of line '<code>\n</code>' and thinks it needs to change that to <code>'\r\n'</code>. So you get the <code>'\r\r\n'</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason you don't see printing to the console have issues is because it's not detecting the extra <code>'\r'</code> as a new line, where as Excel and Notepad++ are.</p>
<p>For Python 3, you should be using the <code>newline=''</code> option as documented here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>csv.writer(csvfile, dialect='excel', **fmtparams)</p>
<p>Return a writer object responsible for converting the userâ€™s data into delimited strings on the given file-like object. csvfile can be any object with a write() method. <strong>If csvfile is a file object, it should be opened with newline='' [1].</strong> </p>
