<p>Why is Python rounding like this?</p>

<p>You should have a look at how floats are handled, and what limitations they have. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html</a> is a Python specific explanation.</p>
<p>In your particular example, Python chooses to use a representation that has a limited number of digits (depends on the Python version). Internally, different float values may share the same (rounded) representation.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Sorry about that, done</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not to do with rounding, it's to do with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.1/tutorial/floatingpoint.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">floating point precision</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK (Damn those snippets.)</span>
