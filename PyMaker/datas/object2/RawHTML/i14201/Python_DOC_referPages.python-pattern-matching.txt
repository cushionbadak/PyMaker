<p>I am a beginner in Python programming and I have a question about constructing a code. </p>
<p>Let's say I have the following data: </p>
<pre><code>150 z   Brazil
160 a   Toys R Us
</code></pre>
<p>I want to code such that if we see the pattern <code>bbb \t (one digit or character not a) \t</code>, I would replace the <code>bbb \t digit \t</code> with <code>bbb_$d$_</code>. (Here, <code>\t</code> indicates tab and <code>bbb</code> indicates a number).</p>
<p>Thus, the output would be <code>150_$z$_Brazil</code>, and the output for <code>160 a   Toys R Us</code> would not be obtained as the digit after <code>160</code> is <code>a</code>. </p>
<p>My question is, how do I code such that I select one digit or character that is not <code>a</code>?</p>
</div>

<p>Q. how do I code such that I select one digit or character that is not a?</p>
<p>A.  <code>'[^a]'</code></p>
<p>The regular expression syntax is <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax">documented here</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Text pattern matching like this is often done with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#regex-howto" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expressions</a>. Regular expressions can get (very) complicated, but they can be useful even if you just learn a few of the basics. Sometimes if your data is more structured, you can get by with simpler things like <code>mytext.split('\t')</code></span>
