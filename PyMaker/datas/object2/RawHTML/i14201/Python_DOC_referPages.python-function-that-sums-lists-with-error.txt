<p>is that the function, it works doing the sum of each sublist but it preserves the the index [0], [1], [2] and [3] and sum the anothers. In this example I will use the list <code>x</code>, in this list the function works correctly. The exit of the program is:</p>
<p><code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 32, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 22]</code></p>
<p>is what I've said it preserves the members [0],[1],[2],[3] and sum the other indices of each sublist.</p>
<p>But when we use some number more than once, it fails.</p>
<p>using:<code>X = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11],[1,2,3,4,**6**,6,7,8,9,10,11],[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]]</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the 6 (index 4) in second sublist was writen twice (the another at the index 5 at the same sublist)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the exit was :<code>[1, 2, 3, 4, **22**, 12, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33]</code></p>
<p>It's wrong!</p>
<p>The correct exit should be: <code>[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 16, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33]</code></p>
<p>Can someone tell me where my code is wrong?</p>

<p>I would recommend ditching the <code>index()</code> approach entirely.</p>
<pre><code>def somalist (lista):
    return lista[0][:4] + [sum(item) for item in list(zip(*lista))[4:]]
</code></pre>
<p>This works on <code>list</code>s with repeated elements.</p>
<pre><code>                                            v
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11],[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11],[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; X = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11],[1,2,3,4,6,6,7,8,9,10,11],[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(somalist(x))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(somalist(X))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 16, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33]

<span class="comment-copy">i'm sorry, it was my first topic here in stackoverflow</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As stated in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list#common-sequence-operations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>, <code>index()</code> only finds the first occurrence.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">for g in i: here you should use enumerate...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TigerhawkT3 i've understand but how can i solve this problem? do you know another function that substiitutes <code>index()</code>?  @EricLevieil how can i do that?, i couldn't uderstand you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It Work's for me, thanks!</span>
