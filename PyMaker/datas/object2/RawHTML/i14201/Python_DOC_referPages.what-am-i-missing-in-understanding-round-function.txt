<p>I was looking at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=round#round" rel="nofollow noreferrer">online doc for <code>round()</code> function</a> in python, which says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>round(number[, ndigits])</code></p>
<p>....The return value is an integer if called with one argument, otherwise of the same type as number.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I wrote the below code.</p>
<pre><code>x = round(32.7)
print 'x is now : ', x
print str(type(x))
print type(x).__name__
</code></pre>
<p>Let me explain the last two prints I used in above snippet.</p>
<ol>
<li>The second print is through trial-and-error method. (Today is my Day 1 for Python)</li>
<li>The third print is added referring to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/402704/2173917">this answer</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Surprisingly, the <strong>current</strong> output is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>x is now :  33.0<br/>&lt;type 'float'&gt;<br/> float</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was <strong>expecting</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>x is now :  33<br/>&lt;type 'int'&gt;<br/> int</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm out of ideas. What am I missing?</p>
<p>P.S. For anybody interested, a <kbd><a href="http://ideone.com/Na9xP2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LIVE VERSION</a></kbd></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In python 2.x, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html?highlight=round#round"><code>round</code></a> always returns a float. </p>
<p>Judging by the syntax of your print statements, you're on python 2.x.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of using round...!try this because round function is to round-off the float values..</p>
<p>However round and type-casting to int both do same work @ background</p>
<p>Hope this helps..!!</p>
<pre><code>x = int(32.7)
print 'x is now :',x
print str(type(x))
print type(x).__name__
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>y=32.7
x=int(y)
print 'x is now :',x
print str(type(x))
print type(x).__name__
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What version of python are you using?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're using python 2, but referring to the python 3 documentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wim Indeed, a noobie mistake. 2.7 it is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="http://ideone.com/tRip5P" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here</a> is your code running as you expect with python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Vincent Spot-on. Thanks much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Wim. Will accept in sometimes. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if you don't mind, one additional Q, is the second and third print statements are in correct syntax?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SouravGhosh For Python 2, yes. For Python 3, no.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ColonelThirtyTwo As of now, I'm staring with 2.7, so I'll <i>assume</i> I'm going correct. :-) BTW, (<i>asking ahead of time</i>) what would be the correct one in 3.X?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SouravGhosh <code>print</code> is a function in 3, so <code>print("hello world")</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer, but I was actually experimenting with <code>round()</code> itself. Nevertheless, appreciate your effort :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">its okay..all the best</span>
