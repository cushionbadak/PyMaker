<p>How can I get the exist status (if command succeed or not) of any line in Python?</p>
<p>For example in bash, <code>$?</code> will tell me the last exist status of any command.
I need it to know if my connection to FTP server was successful or not.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If it is a function you call, it should have a retrun code you can collect like</p>
<pre><code>retVal = doSomething()
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can check what happened.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Have you tried using a <code>try/catch</code>? If there was an error while executing the command, an exception will be raised. You can retrieve it with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sys.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sys</a> module.</p>
<p>Example code:</p>
<pre><code>import sys 

try:
    run_command()
except:
    e = sys.exc_info()[0]
    print(e)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">No, there's no such concept. All you can get is the return value from a function. How are you connecting to the FTP server? Are you using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/ftplib.html#module-ftplib" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ftplib</a>? Also, add your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python is not Bash. Calling functions or methods of classes does not cause an exit status to be set. It may return a value or throw an exception. But there is nothing like <code>$?</code> in Bash. If you want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ftplib</code></a>, read the documentation. There are various exceptions described there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the explanation. and yes, i use ftplib</span>
