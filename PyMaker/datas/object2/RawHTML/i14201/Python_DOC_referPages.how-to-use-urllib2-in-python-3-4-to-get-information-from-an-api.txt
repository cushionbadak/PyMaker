<p>I have managed to work out I need to use urllib2, but I can't install it using pip, I get the error:</p>
<pre><code>Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement urllib2 &lt;from the version: &gt; 
No matching distribution found for urllib2 
</code></pre>
<p>Could someone tell me how I can install urllib2 and also the code I would need to use to get the latitude and longitude? Thanks.</p>

<p>Python3.4 includes <code>urllib</code> (not <code>urllib2</code>) by default. To use it, simply <code>import urllib</code>. </p>
<p>Also, be aware that you should follow <code>urllib</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html" rel="nofollow">docs for Python3.4</a> because things have been moved and are in a different place from where you would expect them if you were looking at <code>urllib2</code>, which was for Python2.</p>
<p>For instance, to request a url using <code>urllib</code>, you would do the following:</p>
<pre><code>from urllib.request import urlopen
with urlopen(url) as link:
    result = link.read()
</code></pre>
<p>However, it is recommended (even by the <code>urllib</code> documentation) that you use <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/" rel="nofollow">requests</a> instead:</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install requests
</code></pre>
<p>Then, to use requests, you can do the following:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import requests
&gt;&gt;&gt; response = requests.get(url)
etc.
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, your endpoint up there is returning JSON, so using <code>requests</code> you can access those values in the following way:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; result = response.json()
&gt;&gt;&gt; result['some_key']
['some values...']
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">urllib2 is bundled with Python 3.4, you don't need to install it. As far as the code, look at the docs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Another alternative is Anaconda distribution. It contains most of the libraries and modules you would even need...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have tried using this method, but i get a huge error thrown when I input the line  "response = requests.get(url)" any ideas?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A <code>huge error</code> is not descriptive enough. The code I posted is very straightforward and should work unless you're getting an <code>SSLError</code>, which means you can't trust the security certificate of the site you're trying to access. You can pass <code>verify=False</code>, i.e., <code>requests.get(url, verify=False</code>) when making the request, but there are issues with blanket trusting all sites.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes it was an SSLError, but the urllib method worked fine after I switched back to that, thank you.</span>
