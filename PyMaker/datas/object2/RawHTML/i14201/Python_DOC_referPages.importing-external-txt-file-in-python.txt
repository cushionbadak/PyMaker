<p>I am trying to import a text with a list about 10 words.</p>
<pre><code>import words.txt
</code></pre>
<p>That doesn't work... 
Anyway, Can I import the file without this showing up?</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
File "D:/python/p1.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
import words.txt
ImportError: No module named 'words'
</code></pre>
<p>Any sort of help is appreciated. </p>

<p>You can import modules but not text files. If you want to print the content do the following:</p>
<p>Open a text file for reading:</p>
<pre><code>f = open('words.txt', 'r')
</code></pre>
<p>Store content in a variable:</p>
<pre><code>content = f.read()
</code></pre>
<p>Print content of this file:</p>
<pre><code>print(content)
</code></pre>
<p>After you're done close a file:</p>
<pre><code>f.close()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As you can't import a .txt file, I would suggest to read words this way.</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>list_ = open("world.txt").read().split()
</code></pre>

<p>The "import" keyword is for attaching python definitions that are created external to the current python program. So in your case, where you just want to read a file with some text in it, use:</p>
<p>text = open("words.txt", "rb").read()</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Import</a> gives you access to other modules in your program. You can't decide to import a text file.

<p>numpy's genfromtxt or loadtxt is what I use:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
...
wordset = np.genfromtxt(fname='words.txt')

<span class="comment-copy">You can't actually do that. If you want to get those words you have to read them into your program. You can see how to do that with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16922214/reading-a-text-file-and-splitting-it-into-single-words-in-python">this question</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>import</code> is used to include library functions. To read files see <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you try Googling "python import"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you want to do with the list of words? Do you wish to create a list of the words, or just print them out exactly as they appear in the file? What does the file look like - are the words comma separated, on separate rows, etc.?</span>
