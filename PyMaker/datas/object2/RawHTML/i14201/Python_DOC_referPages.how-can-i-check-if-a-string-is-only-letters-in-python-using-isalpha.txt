<p>I am trying to check to see if a user's input only contains letters. Other forums seem like the 'isalpha' function seems to be what I'm looking for, yet when I use it in my code and run it, an error appears saying <code>AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'isalpha'</code>.</p>
<p>This is my code: </p>
<pre><code>name='hello'
if name.isalpha():
    print("Your name is valid")
</code></pre>
<p>I don't understand where I'm going wrong.</p>

<p>As most people in the comment have mentioned that tool you have online does not work properly and you should stay away from it.</p>
<p>From the website you provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a simple online Python interpreter, built using the Skulpt
  engine (slightly modified by kwalsh).</p>
<p>Put your Python code below (copy-and-paste or just type it in
  directly), then click run.</p>
<p><strong>Note: this isn't a complete version of Python. See below.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you must use an online interpreter, you might try out the engine that is provided by your school (Skulpt).</p>
<p>But I highly recommend you get python installed onto your laptop, you're less likely to run through any errors.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha" rel="nofollow noreferrer">definitely exists</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How old is your version of Python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what's the version of your python intepreter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suspect the problem is that this is not actually the code you are having a problem with ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>isalpha</code> has been around since at least Python 2.0, released back in October 2000. I doubt this is your real code or your real error message. Check your code for typos.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just tried it  using a different interpreter (repl.it) and it worked, thanks for the help, sorry if it was a basic question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just wondering, any reason why you can't/unable to install python on your laptop? It will really help especially when you progress in your class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd never really thought about it to be honest, I'm not planning on doing computer science after my GCSEs, I just wanted to understand why my program didn't work which is why I asked this question.  Would it take up lots of memory on my laptop if I did install it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">All the installation files together are barely over 100MB on my machine. People run Python on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">$30 computers</a>. Just install it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Absolutely, like TigerhawkT3 mentioned, it's so lightweight it won't hinder the performance of your laptop at all. You don't have to install it of course if you know for sure you're not going to use it, but it's a wonderful tool to have/play with.</span>
