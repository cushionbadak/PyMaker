<p>I'm trying to use different versions of <code>python</code> on <code>win7</code>, and I was told that I can use the <code>python laucher</code>. </p>
<p>I find the docs for it: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher" rel="noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher</a>
But I don't know where is it. Someone say its called <code>py.exe</code>, but there is no file with this name on my computer.</p>
<p>I installed python <code>3.4.3</code> with <code>Anaconda</code>, <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/" rel="noreferrer">https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/</a>, comes with <code>Scipy</code></p>
<p>===========</p>
<p>UPDATE:
Since there is no <code>python launcer</code> in <code>Anacoda</code>, how can I re-install it? Or if there is better way of using different version on <code>Win7</code>?</p>

<p>It should be in the root directory of Python 3.3 installs and higher. It is not available for Python2.</p>
<p>Go to C:\PythonXX\ and you should find py.exe for your version.</p>
<p>In Command Prompt or your favorite shell (like Cygwin), run:</p>
<pre><code>py -3.3 -m path/to/myscript.py
</code></pre>
<p>However, this only works if you have a 3.3 or higher install.</p>
<p>EDIT: Anaconda does not come with Python launcher. It is only available for an ActiveState, standard, or probably many other installs.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Here are two brand-new, Python 3.4 installs of ActiveState Python and Anaconda Python, screenshotted. Notice how Anaconda Python does not include py.exe and a lot of other (non-essential) executables?</p>

<p>EDIT3: After some "difficult" testing, just set anaconda as your default install for Python3.4 and grab the py.exe from another install. That is all. So you can install Python3.4 from another source, uninstall it, and save the py.exe, make sure it is in the system path, and the python launcher is fully installed.</p>
<p>EDIT4: Actually there's also a standalone installer available here:

<p>It looks like the python executable is part of the <code>conda</code> command if you're using Anaconda, according to their website. According to Alexander Huszagh (see his answer), the python <em>launcher</em> doesn't come with Anaconda python.</p>
<p><a href="http://continuum.io/blog/anaconda-python-3" rel="nofollow">Here is a blog post that is perhaps relevant.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If installing python from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python.org's downloads</a> and you select "[x] install pylauncher [x] install for all users", py.exe is installed in <code>C:\Windows\py.exe</code>.</p>
<p>I think if you don't install for all users, then it's in the python install root.</p>
<p>If you are able to run <code>py</code> from <code>cmd.exe</code>, then you can find out where it is with <code>where py.exe</code>.</p>

<p>The experts gave a reply which seems relevant to one version of python but not the latest version.  e.g. In my least favorite command line tool I entered:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Python36-32&gt;dir py.exe /s</p>
<p>It replied:
File Not Found</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hmm, your answer seems perhaps more useful than mine - not sure why it was downvoted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then how can I install it? And is there anyother good distribution? I really like <code>Anaconda</code> comes with <code>Scipy</code>, makes python much more accssible for laymen like me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's a standalone installer available here:  <a href="https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/pylauncher/downloads" rel="nofollow noreferrer">bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/pylauncher/downloads</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This answer is ... blatantly not correct. The Python installer(s) put <code>py.exe</code> in <code>%SYSTEMROOT%</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Will, This answer is nearly 3 years old and tools change in much shorter periods. If information has changed in that time, you are free to update it with newer versions of software, or write a comment so I may do so. Your aggressive post stating that the information is blatantly incorrect completely ignores the time at which it was posted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No. The Python launcher is py.exe which is found main directory in the standard install, as well as the ActiveState Python installs for Python 3.3 and later.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Edited to fix - thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't come default, by the way.</span>
