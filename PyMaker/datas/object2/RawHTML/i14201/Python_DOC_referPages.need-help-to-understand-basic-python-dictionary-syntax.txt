<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I just started to learn Python and I am confused in its syntax.</p>
<p>I am not sure what square brackets around the variable word mean... I understand word should be our value and prev is a key.</p>
<pre><code>mimic_dict[prev] = [word]
</code></pre>
<p>I also do not understand this expression</p>
<pre><code>mimic_dict[prev] = mimic_dict.get(prev, []) + [word]
</code></pre>
<p>Need your help to clarify this.</p>
<p>I checked out documentation for python dictionary, but it was not much of help.
Sorry for such a basic question, but I really could not figure it out by googling. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>mimic_dict[prev] = [word]
</code></pre>
<p><code>[word]</code> is a list containing a single element, the value of the <code>word</code> variable.</p>
<pre><code>mimic_dict.get(prev, []) + [word]
</code></pre>
<p><code>+</code> can be used to concatenate two lists. This adds <code>word</code> to the list returned by <code>mimic_dict.get(prev, [])</code>.</p>
<p>And what does <code>mimic_dict.get(prev, [])</code> do? It is the same as <code>mimic_dict[prev]</code>, but if the key <code>prev</code> doesn't exist then it returns a default value of <code>[]</code> (an empty list). It ensures you always get a list back whether or not the key exists.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You are creating a list of a single element, that happens to be <code>word</code>. The second expression says <i>"get the value corresponding to the key <code>prev</code>, if it doesn't exist return an empty list. Then append the element <code>word</code> to that list using list concatenation"</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">1. <code>[word]</code> is a list. 2. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dict.get</code></a>.</span>
