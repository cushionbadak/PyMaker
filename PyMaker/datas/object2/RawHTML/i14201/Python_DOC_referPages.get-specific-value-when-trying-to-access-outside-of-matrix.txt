<p>Can I receive a specified value (0 for example) when trying to get a value outside of a NumPy matrix?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>#getItem - some method which do what i want
a = numpy.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
getItem(a, 1, 1) # == 4
getItem(a, -1, 1) # == 0
</code></pre>
<p>Of course I can do it by hand, but in Python these approaches may have bad performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use a <code>try</code>/<code>except</code> block to handle invalid indices</p>
<pre><code>def getItem(a, i, j):
    try:
        return a[i,j]
    except IndexError:
        return 0

&gt;&gt;&gt; getItem(a, 1, 1)
4
&gt;&gt;&gt; getItem(a, 2, 5)
0
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@Dark_Daiver To index an array, the class's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.__getitem__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>operator.__getitem__</code></a>. is called. This operator is deliberately defined to throw an <code>IndexError</code> exception when you index out of bounds. If you choose that you'd like to <code>return 0</code> in this case, you are free to write a function like above. But Python doesn't want to force this behavior on everyone, because it may not make sense to <code>return 0</code> in many cases.</span>
