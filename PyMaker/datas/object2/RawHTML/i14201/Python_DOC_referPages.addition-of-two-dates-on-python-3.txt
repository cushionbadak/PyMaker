<p>I try adding date and hours from csv file in one datetime variable. I read questions about adding some timedelta and official doc <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects</a>, but don't understend how it works.</p>
<p>My csv row looks like - ['2005.02.28', '17:38', '1.32690', '1.32720', '1.32680', '1.32720', '5'].I convert row[0] = 2005.02.28 to date and convert row[1] = 17:38. Now i need creating new datetime variable looks like 2005.02.28 17:38. How i can do it?</p>
<pre><code>import csv
import datetime as dt
with open('EURUSDM1.csv') as csvfile:
  datereader=csv.reader(csvfile)
      for row in datereader:
          date=dt.datetime.strptime(row[0], "%Y.%m.%d")
          time=dt.datetime.strptime(row[1], "%H:%M")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Once you have both the values in two variables, <code>new_date</code> and <code>new_time</code>, you could simply combine them to get the datetime, like this,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; new_date = dt.datetime.strptime(row[0], "%Y.%m.%d")
&gt;&gt;&gt; new_time = dt.datetime.strptime(row[1], "%H:%M").time()
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; dt.datetime.combine(new_date, new_time)
datetime.datetime(2005, 2, 28, 17, 38)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:-</strong> Avoid using <code>date</code> and <code>time</code> as variable names, as they are also part of the <code>datetime</code> library. Use a variable name that is relevant to your application context.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Wow! Thanks, it work perfect. But on future, if i have got two object from different files - how i should do addition date and time variable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The other answer just posted by @pankaj-parashar answers this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your decision, it helped me a lot, but I marked an answer pankaj-parashar as a solution to the problem, since it is a more general solution and I think will help others in many cases.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I completely agree. That one is a much better and elegant solution.</span>
