<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is my program. The user must input all the prices of their items and when they are done they input: total. This is then supposed to add up all the prices that they input and return them a total. Every time I run the program, it says:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>I under stand that I cannot force list to be a number, but I can't think of a fix.</p>
<p>This is my program:</p>
<pre><code>#Python Register Thingy
priceItems=[0]
total='total'
def main():
    regReport(regCalc(regInput()))
def regInput():
    user=input("Please enter the prices of your items, once you are done type: total.\n")     
    if(user==total):
        pass
    else:
        priceItems.append(int(user))
        regInput()
def regCalc(items):
    totalPrice=sum(int(priceItems[0:]))   
def regReport(total):
    print("""
====================================
    Kettle Moraine Ka$h Register
       Thanks for Shopping!
====================================
    Your total:""")
    return totalPrice
main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As the traceback says, the error is here:</p>
<pre><code>totalPrice=sum(int(priceItems[0:]))
</code></pre>
<p>This one line actually contains a few mistakes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>priceItems[0:]</code> is a slice from the beginning to the end of <code>priceItems</code> - in other words, <code>[0:]</code> is doing nothing. That's not an error exactly, but it <em>is</em> pointless, and suggests that you don't really know what you're trying to achieve with it.</p></li>
<li><p><code>int(priceItems[0:])</code> is trying to convert the list to an integer, which obviously won't work.</p></li>
<li><p>If you had somehow been able to convert the list to an integer, <code>sum(int(priceItems[0:]))</code> would then try to get the sum of that integer, which doesn't make sense either; you sum a collection of numbers, not a single one.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Instead, use the function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow"><code>map</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>totalPrice = sum(map(int, priceItems))
</code></pre>
<p>That'll take each item in the list, convert it to an integer and sum the results.</p>
<p>Note though, that the entire thing could be written as:</p>
<pre><code>print('Your total is:', sum(map(int, iter(lambda: input('Please enter the prices of your items, once you are done type: total.'), 'total')))) 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you prefer a less functional style, you can use a generator expression</p>
<pre><code>totalPrice = sum(int(x) for x in priceItems))
</code></pre>
<p>Better yet convert the items to <code>int</code> as part of your input validation so you are creating a list of <code>int</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I have used the map function that you have given me, but when I run the program and enter the numbers, the total price comes up as none. I have replaced the int(priceItems[0:]) with the function you gave me. I need to make this program work using the functions, so any idea why the total output is none?</span>
