<p>Syntax looks correct. I even tried with another IP address that is pingable and same error.</p>

<p>I am looking at the port you are using (21) and it's the FTP port.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers</a></p>
<p>I don't see any errors in your code per se, but here some things I am worried about:</p>
<p>a) A lot of places lock down and turn off <code>FTP</code>, <code>telnet</code>, etc. ports
     that are historically used, but in today's security consious world,
     we use <code>scp</code> and <code>ssh</code> (instead of <code>ftp</code> and <code>ssh</code>).  You might talk to your
     system administrators and see if that service is even turned on,
     or let alone your filewall even allows that port to go through.</p>
<p>b) I am not used to seeing the default parameters, but I assume you 
     want </p>
<blockquote>
<p>socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have Python 2.6, and that is the defaults for that (which I assume
   is the same for 2.7).</p>
<p>c) I would try this on different ports to see if it is a port problem.
     Of course, the early numbered ports are special "well-known ports" that
     normal users can't use.   I usually use port 9711 or 8888.</p>
<p>d) I would also try it without the timeout and see if that works.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

<p>This is not a direct answer to your question, but if you're seeking to do FTP transfers, may I suggest to use the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html" rel="nofollow">ftplib</a> module instead?</p>
