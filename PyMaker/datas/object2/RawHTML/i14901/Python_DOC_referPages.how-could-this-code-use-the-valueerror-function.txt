<p>I tried except ValueError, but it stated that it was invalid syntax. I'm trying to get the code to force the user to enter an integer for the answer, if they don't then it tells them that they are supposed to enter an integer.</p>

<p><code>ValueError</code> is not a function; it is a class (an <code>Exception</code> subclass). </p>
<p>You need to use <code>except</code> as part of a <code>try</code> statement, it cannot be used on its own; you need to put any code you want 'protected' inside the <code>try</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if op == '+':
    left1 = random.randint(1,100)

<span class="comment-copy">why do you turn the <code>ints </code>to <code>strings</code> to add them?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanielJimenez: to create a valid Python expression in a string. It is redundant here because the code already determined that <code>op</code> is <code>+</code>, so you could just use <code>answer = left1 + right1</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters but why not <code>answer = left1 + right1</code></span>
