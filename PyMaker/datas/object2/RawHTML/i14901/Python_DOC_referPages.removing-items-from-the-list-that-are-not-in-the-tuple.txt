<p>Write and test a Python function leppard to go through the zoo_list and remove any item that is not also in zoo_dictionary. Use the following tuple as the dictionary:</p>
<h2>( "lion", "tiger", "bear", "chupacabra", "giraffe", "sloth" )</h2>
<pre><code>n = int(input("Enter the number of animals: "))
zoo_list = []
zoo_dictionary = ( "lion", "tiger", "bear", "chupacabra", "giraffe", "sloth" )
for i in range(n):
    lists = input("Enter the names of each animal: ")
    zoo_list.append(lists)


for i in range(n-1):
    if zoo_list[i] not in zoo_dictionary:
        zoo_list1 = zoo_list.pop(i)
</code></pre>
<h2>    print(zoo_list)</h2>
<p>that's my code but when I enter "cat" "dog" "lion" "bear" "monkey" 
my list shows ["dog","lion","bear"]
any reason why? please and thank you :)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>in the first iteration of your second for loop when the value of i is 0,
when you did</p>
<pre><code>zoo_list1 = zoo_list.pop(i)
</code></pre>
<p>the element at index 0 in the list get removed. Now the list becomes</p>
<pre><code>["dog", "lion", "bear", "monkey"]
</code></pre>
<p>Now the loop continues and in the second iteration of the loop, the value of i is 1, and in the new list(formed after first iteration) the element at index 1 is "lion". Thus you are missing the element "dog".</p>
<p>And what you are saying a dictionary is actually a set, not dictionary.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As mentioned in one of the other answers, mutating a list you're trying to iterate over is a recipe for disaster.  Instead, build a new list and then assign that list to <code>zoo_list</code></p>
<pre><code>n = int(input("Enter the number of animals: "))
zoo_list = []
zoo_dictionary = ("lion", "tiger", "bear", "chupacabra", "giraffe", "sloth")
for i in range(n):
    zoo_list.append(input("Enter the names of each animal: "))

zoo_list = [animal for animal in zoo_list if animal in zoo_animals]
print(zoo_list)
</code></pre>
<p>I've remove the unnecessary assignment to the <code>lists</code> variable.  I've also removed your erroneous for loop and replaced it with a list comprehension.  If you wanted to use a for loop still, you'd do something like this</p>
<pre><code>temp = []
for animal in zoo_list:
    if animal in zoo_dictionary:
        temp.append(animal)
zoo_list = temp
</code></pre>
<p>You could also use the builtin function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow"><code>filter</code></a>.  Replace the list comprehension or the for loop (whichever method you use) with the following.</p>
<pre><code>zoo_list = filter(lambda x : x in zoo_animals, zoo_list)
</code></pre>
<p>and you'll get the same result.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you should use a while loop here. Here's a the code for Python 2.</p>
<pre><code>    n = int(input("Enter the number of animals: "))
    zoo_list = []
    zoo_dictionary = ( "lion", "tiger", "bear", "chupacabra", "giraffe", "sloth" )

    while len(zoo_list) &lt; n:
        item = input("Enter the names of each animal: ")
        zoo_list.append(item)

    print zoo_list, len(zoo_list)
    for i in range(n-1):
        if zoo_list[i] in zoo_dictionary:
            zoo_list.remove(zoo_list[i])

    print zoo_list
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You have solutions below, but the way to get at them is e.g. to inspect the value of <code>zoo_list</code> and <code>zoo_list1</code> in a debugger. That should have given you a hint what is going on. That said, the "dictionary" is already the wrong type, it should be a set: <code>zoo = {'dingo', 'mouse', 'hedgehog'}</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This kind of problem really lends itself to being solved using list comprehensions (or generator expressions). In this case, the list of elements in <code>zoo_list</code> which are not also in <code>zoo_dictionary</code> is <code>[x for x in zoo_list if x not in zoo_dictionary]</code>. I think the beauty (besids being concise) of this is that it almost reads like Enligsh.</span>
