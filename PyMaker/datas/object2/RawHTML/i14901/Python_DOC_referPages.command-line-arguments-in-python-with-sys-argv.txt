<p>I want to use <code>sys.argv</code> to access the arguments passed to the script. Here is my code :</p>
<pre><code>if __name__ == '__main__':
    data = {}
    if len(sys.argv) &gt;= 2 :read_inputs(data, sys.argv[1])
    else : print "ERROR : the config file is required in the command line"

    if len(sys.argv) &gt;= 3 :data['Parameters']['Mode'] = sys.argv[2]
    print_data(data)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>I understand that <code>sys.argv[1]</code> and <code>sys.argv[2]</code> refer to the arguments.</li>
<li>My arguments are contained in a text file.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I cannot understand is how can I tell the code that it needs to read the arguments in that exact text file.
I used <code>python Interface.py config.txt</code> but it didn't work. </p>
<p>Any ideas ?</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly you want what would normally be on the command line to be in that file, right?</p>
<p>You can do that using command substitution <code>python Interface.py $(&lt; config.txt)</code>, as seen <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4227994/command-line-arguments-from-a-file-content">here</a></p>

<p>Although not a direct answer to your question, I would highly recommend using the Python argparse module to parse command line argument. I your case I would add a "-c, --config" option that specifies the location of the config file that you want to use. See the documentation for examples: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you expecting Python to magically guess that <code>argv[1]</code> contains a file it should go and (somehow) read to get arguments? That is <b>not</b> going to happen.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should open that file with <code>open()</code> and read data from there. What is your problem? Or you may use shell (if you working with nix-like System) to help you reading arguments like <code>python Interface.py $(cat config.txt)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Read that file in your code. Refer this link for the examples: <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_files_io.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorialspoint.com/python/python_files_io.htm</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">So I opened the file like this : <code>obj = open("config.txt","r")</code> like it says in the link. Then I did this: <code>sys.argv[0] = obj.name</code> But it didn't work. @PrerakSola @myaut</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>obj.name</code> returns you the file name. You need to use <code>read()</code> or <code>readLine()</code> to read the contents. There are examples of it in the link I gave. Scroll down further and you'll find it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I used your command, but it says that there is a syntax error ..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That error should usually tell you where the syntax error is.. that's a problem in your python code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It says that it's in the command : ` python Interface.py $(&lt; config.txt)                    ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax `</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what system are you on?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Windows ! @greschd</span>
