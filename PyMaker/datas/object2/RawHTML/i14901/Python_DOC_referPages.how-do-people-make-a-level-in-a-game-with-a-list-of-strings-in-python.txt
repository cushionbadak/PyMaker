<p>i would like to know because i am making games in pygame and would like to use this method because it looks neat and tidy.</p>
<p>EXE</p>
<pre><code>level = "WWWWWWWW" \
        "WSSSSSSW" \
        "WSSSSSSW" \
        "WSSSSSSW" \
        "WSSSSSSW" \
        "WWWWWWWW"
</code></pre>
<p>Here the s's are empty space and the w's are blocks</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you use that method, you will need to define the dimensions of the level - LEVELWIDTH and LEVELHEIGHT, in this case 8 and 6, then you can find the block at x, y with this code:</p>
<pre><code>LEVELWIDTH = 8
LEVELHEIGHT = 6

def GetBlock(x, y): 
    return level[x * LEVELWIDTH + y]
</code></pre>
<p>remembering that the indexes x and y both start at zero and end with the last item at the index length - 1 because of Python's method of indexing.</p>
<p>Here is a different method I have used in situations like this:</p>
<pre><code>level = ['WWWWWWWW',
         'WSSSSSSW',
         'WSSSSSSW',
         'WSSSSSSW',
         'WSSSSSSW',
         'WWWWWWWW']
</code></pre>
<p>with this method all you need to do to find what block is at (x, y) is:</p>
<pre><code>level[x][y]
</code></pre>
<p>but remember if you want to be able to edit the level, you need to create a new string for each row you edit, because you cant assign items to a string.
E.g: To set the block at x, y with the string new:</p>
<pre><code>level[y] = level[x][:y] + new + level[x][y+1:]
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings</a> for more information on indexing
the method I have shown is based off of the examples in this book
<a href="http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/" rel="nofollow">http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/</a>
and a good example of levels in use in the book is in chapter 9 - Star Pusher</p>

<span class="comment-copy">By reading the letters and generating objects that correspond with them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't you want to have new lines after each string segement using <code>\n</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jakekimds - That's not really need since he alreay know that the level is a 8x6 in size.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It would be easier to use 2D arrays instead of strings here. You can make it almost as neat.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jakekimds - can u explain more jakekmids</span>
