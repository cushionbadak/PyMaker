<p>This probably is a really dumb question but when I type an answer, It is the correct answer, but it still says  "incorrect, the answer is....." then prints out the answer I typed to begin with, so it isn't assigning 'rightanswer' to answer'. help?? (this is the newer version of python so the parenthesis are needed)</p>
<pre><code>import random
ops = ['+', '-', '*', '/']
num1 = (random.randint(1,10))
num2 = (random.randint(1,10))
operation = (random.choice(ops))

maths = (num1, operation, num2)

print (maths)

answer = input("what is the answer to the above sum?")

if operation == "/":
    CorrectAnswer = (num1/num2)
elif operation == "*":
    CorrectAnswer = (num1*num2)
elif operation == "-":
    CorrectAnswer = (num1-num2)
else:
    CorrectAnswer = (num1+num2)

time.sleep(1)
if answer == CorrectAnswer:
    print ("correct!")

    print ("incorrect, the answer is", CorrectAnswer)

<p>In Python 3, <code>input()</code> returns a <em>string</em>; strings are never equal to integers or floating point numbers:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; input('Enter the number 42: ') == 42
Enter the number 42: 42
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; '42' == 42
False
</code></pre>
<p>Convert the answer to an integer or float first before testing it against your calculated <code>CorrectAnswer</code> integer:</p>
<pre><code>answer = int(input("what is the answer to the above sum?"))
</code></pre>

<p>If you are going to use <code>float()</code>, take into account that floating point values are <em>approximations</em>, and a user typing in <code>0.33</code> while your <code>1 / 3</code> expression actually produces <code>0.3333333333333333</code> is likely to lead to issues:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1/3
0.3333333333333333
&gt;&gt;&gt; float('0.33') == 1/3
False

<p><code>input</code> will return a string, but <code>CorrectAnswer</code> is a numeric type, such as <code>float</code>. You should convert <code>answer</code> to a float and then compare - </p>
<p><code>if float(answer) == CorrectAnswer</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Side note: in your message to the user, "above sum" should only allow <code>+</code> operation problems, but obviously that's not the case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To martijn Pieters - Don't mean to sound stuck up, yes I am a student but I am also 2 years before my GCSE's and there isn't a computing course available in my school so I decided to teach myself. Sorry if you think I wasted your time.</span>
