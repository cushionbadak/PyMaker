<p>I can't seem to figure out how to write this piece of Python Code.</p>
<p>I need to read something in from a file, which is this:</p>
<pre><code>Jake FJ49FJH
Bob FJ49GKH
</code></pre>
<p>I've imported the file into a dictionary. I then check if the number plate (following the names) contains the sequence of two letters, two numbers, then three letters. Here is that part of the code:</p>
<pre><code>d = {} # Blank Dictionary

with open("plates.txt") as f:
  d = dict(x.rstrip().split(None, 1) for x in f) # Put file into dictionary

names = d.keys()
print(names)
#carReg = ??


a,b,c = carReg[:2],carReg[2:4],carReg[4:]
if all((a.isalpha(),b.isdigit(),c.isalpha(),len(c)== 3)):
    print("Valid Reg")
else:
    print("Invalid Reg")
    # Now get the name of the person with the invalid carReg
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, I don't know what to put for <code>carReg</code>. I need to loop through the dictionary, like in a list when you can use an integer to get part of the list. If the program returns <code>Invalid Reg</code>, then I need to get the key that the invalid reg belongs to - which will be a name.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>

<p>Iterate over <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.items" rel="nofollow"><code>dict.items()</code></a>; it'll give you the <code>(key, value)</code> pairs from the dictionary:</p>
<pre><code>for name, car_registration in d.items():
</code></pre>
