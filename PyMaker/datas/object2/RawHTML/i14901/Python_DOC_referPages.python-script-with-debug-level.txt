<p>I'm a newbie. I'm trying a script a 'snmpwalk' in PYTHON which returns list of OID from the starting ID mentioned. </p>
<p>I see Python has various options over shell scripts, so I choose this.</p>
<p>I need few ideas on how to do and process it.</p>
<p>If I execute the script with <em>--debug</em> option it should list all the OIDs in the stdout (I meant the executing screen) &amp;
Always it should log the output of the bash commands to a log file.</p>
<p>Then I will check for any anomalies. </p>
<p>Please someone give me the kickstart on how to proceed.</p>

<p>Python has some great standard libraries that will help you massively with this. For logging, use the aptly-named <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow"><code>logging</code></a> library. Combine that with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow"><code>argparse</code></a> to detect the debug flag and you got yourself a shell script with customisable log levels.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much for the response. But I see that logging is very helpful to give some system messages when there is a bug in script.  What I feel is to display the output of an execution when an option is enabled.  Can u share some scripts which you think apt? I tried a to dig on logging but couldn't make it clear!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hashjagz if you feel like I answered your question, would you be so kind to mark it as the answer? Thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm a newbie. it requires few reputations to cast my vote.  Btw, can u please respond for above?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hashjagz please read this about marking answers: <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/5235">meta.stackexchange.com/a/5235</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@hashjagz also see this answer about getting the logger level: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1987484/238310">stackoverflow.com/a/1987484/238310</a> which you can then use in a simple <code>if</code> statement. Or you can set a simple <code>DEBUG = False</code> at the top of your code and then edit it later... or maybe pass a <code>debug</code> argument to your functions?</span>
