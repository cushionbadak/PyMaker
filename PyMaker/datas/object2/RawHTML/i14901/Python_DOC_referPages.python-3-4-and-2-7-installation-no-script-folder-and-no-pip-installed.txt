<p>I was doing a fresh installation for <code>Python 2.7.9</code> and <code>3.4.3</code> on <code>Win7 X64</code> today, and I found that there is no <code>Script</code> folder in <code>Python27</code> and <code>Python34</code> folder as first child level folder, but there is one in <code>Tools</code>. However, I couldn't find <code>pip</code> within that Script folder, although <code>pip</code> should be installed with <code>Python</code> by default. The other I was doing the same installation for my other PC and laptop, there was <code>Script</code> folder (as first level child folder in <code>Python27</code> and <code>Python34</code>) containing <code>pip</code>. So what is going on? how to install <code>pip</code> and maybe other useful scripts this way?</p>
<p>[EDIT] I tried <code>python -m ensurepip</code> in <code>Python34</code>. I got the following errors:</p>

<p>If you used the PSF (python.org) .msi Windows installers, pip (and dependencies) should be installed in pythonxy/Lib/site-packages for 3.4.0+ and 2.7.9+.  There should also be pythonxy/Scripts containing about 5 .exes.  This is the last part of the install process.  A command prompt window should briefly appear. Perhaps you did not have [ ] install pip checked when doing the installs (although this should have been checked by default).  Perhaps there was an error that you missed.</p>
<p>In any case, you should have pythonxy/Lib/ensurepip/* present for both 2.7 and 3.4 and you should be able to run this module now.  In Command Prompt, try <code>python -m ensurepip</code> in both .../python27 and .../python34.</p>

<p>Windows 10. I had this issue while installing Python 2.7 into C:/Program Files/Python27 .. I think in this case it was a path issue. Fix was to do an install into C:/Python27, copy the Scripts folder from that installation to the installation in C:/Program Files/Python27. Everything else (including the paths to Python and Scripts) was fine. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I ran into the same issue today while trying to install Python 2.7.13 in my computer; after some investigation I realized that v.3.60 ("Anaconda") was already present (it came along with Microsoft Visual Studio 2017, which I've installed a couple weeks ago).</p>
<p>I suspected of some path mismatch in the registry, so I tried removing both Python v. 3.60 and 2.17, and cleaning up the Registry by deleting the <em>HKCU\Software\Python</em> key (which, due to some reason, was still present).
After this, I was able to correctly install version 2.7.13, and this time the \scripts folder is present, with all the expected contents.</p>
<p>I don't know if installing v. 3.6 again would cause any problem: I'm not going to try this for the time since I'm currently developing for v.2.7.</p>
<p>Hope this can be of some help, anyway.</p>

<p>EDIT:
I've made some further investigation and think I've discovered the reason why (in my case), the \Scripts folder was missing: the path where I was going to install Python is in virtual drive.</p>
<p>In my computer I only have one partition (C:), and i've mapped a folder (C:\Development) as D:, then I tried to install Python on D:\Python27; apparently this is not "good" and causes some problem in the installer.</p>
<p>After discovering that, I tried installing to the real path, and now everything seems to be OK.</p>

<p>Guess what? In case you have <strong>NetBeans</strong> (or probably <strong>GlassFish</strong>) installed, then it could break installation for <strong>pip</strong>!</p>
<p><em>Details:</em> there's <a href="https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=251538" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a bug</a> in NetBeans installer that could sometimes break the Windows registry in a way that's not expected by other installers.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44593979/2684760">@J3soon's answer</a> was close, but <a href="http://www.swarley.me.uk/blog/2014/04/23/python-pip-and-windows-registry-corruption/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Swarley's blog post</a> haven't fixed the problem in my environment, <em>because it wasn't a null character but was another kind of registry corruption</em>.</p>
<p>And here's how I got rid of the issue. Run the following PowerShell script:</p>
<pre><code>$local_key = 'HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*'
$machine_key = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*'
$machine_key6432 = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*'
$items = Get-ChildItem @($local_key, $machine_key, $machine_key6432)
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'

foreach ($item in $items) {
    Write-Output $item.PSPath
    $null = Get-ItemProperty $item.PSPath
}
</code></pre>
<p>It will write the registry key names to the output. In case it prints an error, <strong>take the one last key it printed</strong> and remove that from the registry (using PowerShell or <code>regedit</code> or whatever tool you prefer).</p>
<p>After that, reinstall Python, and it should install pip as intended.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Based on a combination of whats here, and what I found elsewhere, here is how I fixed it:</p>
<p>Uninstall whatever is installed already.
Go to regedit and HKLM/SOFTWARE/Python and delete the whole python section.
Reinstall Python</p>
<p>This installed with the scripts folder this time.</p>
<p>Hope this helps someone.</p>

<p>I am using python 3.6.2 and faced a similar issue of missing scripts folder(also pip script) in python folder. I have done following things to add scripts folder again to python.</p>
<ol>
<li>Goto - Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Programs and Features
      then look for python program and try to uninstall it. A pop window 
      will appear which shows the following image.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H1muf.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Image Python</a> </p>
<p>Try to REPAIR the installed program that should fix the issue. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Otherwise click on MODIFY and tick on pip check box and Add Python to environment variables checkbox, then install it. This should fix the issue.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Even I was facing this issue. I solved it by doing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Uninstall python. (you can use the installer(python-2.7.xx.msi) to perform the uninstall. Select the option 'Remove Python'on double clicking the installer.)</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the environment variable 'Path', and remove the python directory path. ( To change the environment variable, right click on 'This PC', click properties, click 'Advanced System Properties' -&gt;Environment Variables)</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the environment variable 'Python Path' if present.</p></li>
<li><p>Now reinstall python. </p></li>
</ol>
<p>It will work !!! </p>

<p>Actually Scipts folder will not create after installing python, you have to manually create this folder and then install pip, then you can find the required files in this directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I had also faced the same problem which i managed to solve. The problem is when you install the python in default configuration then it installs the python folder in the "c:\user\Appdata......" which is lengthy and hard to find . To avoid it first uninstall  the python 3.7 completely from the system from the control panel -&gt;uninstall program. Then install it again with the option " customize installation". On the next page change the default location to C:/Python/Python37-32 and select the required check boxes and click install. This should solve your problem. </p>

<p>It is permission issue. I have both python 2 and 3 installed under </p>
<p><code>C:\Program Files\python\2.7.16</code></p>
<p><code>C:\Program Files\python\3.7.2</code></p>
<p>Python 2 installer is msi, so there is no <code>run as admin</code> option when install it</p>
<p>Python 3 installer is exe, there is <code>run as admin</code> option.</p>
<p>As the results, python 2 installed without <code>scripts</code> and <code>pip.exe</code> and python 3 installed successfully.</p>
<p>To fix this, simply give the <code>full</code> permission to <code>everyone</code> on </p>
<p><code>C:\Program Files\python\</code> and install python 2 again. then change the permission back.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you think that pip should be installed with Python by default? It is not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which OS are you using?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You use the bundled pip as <code>python -m pip install SomePackage</code>. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/installing</a> for further information how to use the respective pip for python3 and python2 if you have both versions installed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@yole it is stated on the pip website - "Python 2.7.9 and later (on the python2 series), and Python 3.4 and later include pip by default"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, indeed. I wasn't aware it was added to 2.7.9.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi, I tried <code>python -m ensurepip</code>, but got some errors listed in the OP. <code>C:\Pythonxy\Lib\site-packages</code> contains nothing but a <code>README</code> file. BTW, what is <code>PSF</code>? I downloaded <code>Windows</code> installers for <code>2.7</code> and <code>3.4</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python Software Foundation, which operates xyz.python.org sites.  I saw your post on python-list.  The error message suggest that arg 2 is a string <i>with</i> a null, which seems like a bug somewhere.  If no answer here or there, perhaps worth a bug report on bugs.python.org.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So do I, this should be marked as an answer :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">please try using , python -m ensurepip command</span>
