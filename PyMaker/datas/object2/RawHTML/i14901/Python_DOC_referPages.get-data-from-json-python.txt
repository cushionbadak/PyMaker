<p>I'm working on doing a live currency converter in Python. I've successfully fetched all the data needed from the URL into Python. However I'm now trying to call a specific string in the url. Here's my current code:</p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request
import json

##Define JSON API Url
with urllib.request.urlopen("http://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json?app_id=XXX") as url:
    response = url.read()

##Print Fetched data
print (response)
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see I've printed all the data it's fetched, but it's now printing specific strings from it.</p>
<p>My question is, how do i parse specific strings from the url ? I've heard of json.load ,is that something i should use ?</p>

<p>You'll need to load the data as JSON; the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow"><code>json</code> module</a> can do this for you, but you need to decode the data to text first.</p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request
import json

with urllib.request.urlopen("http://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json?app_id=XXX") as url:
    response = url.read()

charset = url.info(). get_content_charset('utf-8')  # UTF-8 is the JSON default
data = json.loads(response.decode(charset))
</code></pre>
<p>From there on out <code>data</code> is a Python object.</p>
<p>Judging by the <a href="https://openexchangerates.org/documentation#preview-api-response" rel="nofollow">documenation</a> you should be able to access rates as:</p>
<pre><code>print('Euro rate', data['rates']['EUR'])
</code></pre>
<p>for example.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">what's the question? did you try <code>json.loads(response)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry my question has been edited. Could you explain further with the json.loads ? Thank you for the fast reply</span>
<span class="comment-copy">better to search documentation first: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/json.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your question would have started out better had you just tried <code>json.loads()</code> <i>first</i>. You may have run into problems, but you could then at least have included the error message here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Brilliant that's worked! Thanks for your help :)</span>
