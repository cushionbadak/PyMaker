<p>I am currently using subprocess to run a Python script inside of my current Python but it is keep giving me an error:</p>
<pre><code>for dir in os.listdir(os.path.join(DIR2,dirname)):
    temp = os.path.join(os.path.join(DIR2,dirname),dir)
    files = [os.path.join(temp, f) for f in os.listdir(temp) if f.endswith("json")]
    for lists in files:
        subprocess.Popen(["python", DIR4, os.path.join(temp,lists)])
</code></pre>
<p>Above is what I am currently using. 
<code>DIR4</code> is the path of the python that I want to run.</p>
<p>Problem is, the python that I want to run can only take one file at a time.
However this subprocess looks like it tries to execute ALL at ONCE.</p>
<p>I want to run ONE at a time, instead of ALL at ONCE.
Because it is running ALL at ONCE, my python that I want to run does not work the way it is.. </p>
<p>What do I need to do to change this? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to wait first for the subprocess to terminate, before going ahead, I think you could use Popen.wait():</p>
<pre><code>...
p = subprocess.Popen(["python", DIR4, os.path.join(temp,lists)])
p.wait()
...
</code></pre>

<p>To actually do what you're asking, and not hack it together through subprocess, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec" rel="nofollow"><code>exec</code></a> which allows you to run python code with your own provided globals and locals.</p>
<p>In older versions of Python (meaning pre-3), you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#execfile" rel="nofollow"><code>execfile</code> to achieve the same thing</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What error are you getting? Python is going to execute the subprocesses asynchronously, but with different python interpreters. So if you only want 1 subprocess running (why use sub processing then?) you're going to have to wait on each subprocess to finish before starting a new one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am getting an error message that is in the other python.. Because it can not find the file which is already running.. How can I run one at a time as you mentioned? @Falmarri</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am using subprocesses because that is the only way that I know how to run python inside of python.. but as you said.. it is running asynchronously.. and I don't want that..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh my gosh.. Thank you so much... I think it is working fine now...  but just a quick question.. is there a better way to do this rather than using the subprocess?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you could import the python script you want to execute, and then directly call some appropriate function!</span>
