<p>I'm trying to raise an error when a directory does not exist, before I open files in that directory. According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2052390/manually-raising-throwing-an-exception-in-python/24065533#24065533">this response</a> I should use the most specific Exception constructor for my issue, which I think is <code>NotADirectoryError</code>. But running the code below I get <code>NameError: global name 'NotADirectoryError' is not defined</code>. Thanks in advance for any help!</p>
<pre><code>import os
if not os.path.isdir(baselineDir):
  raise NotADirectoryError("No results directory for baseline.")
</code></pre>
<p>And if there's a better way to do this please suggest it, thanks.</p>

<p>You're likely using Python 2, which does not define <code>NotADirectoryError</code>. However, this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/exceptions.html#NotADirectoryError" rel="nofollow"><em>is</em> defined</a> in Python 3, for exactly the purpose you're trying to use it for.</p>
<p>If you need to use Python 2, you'll need to define the error yourself through a class. Read through the docs about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#user-defined-exceptions" rel="nofollow">user-defined exceptions</a> to learn about subclassing the <code>Exception</code> class and customizing it for your own needs, if necessary. Here's a very simple example:</p>
<pre><code>class NotADirectoryError(Exception):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>This will take the string passed to it and print it out, just like you want.</p>

<p>The error message is pretty clear: <code>NotADirectoryError</code> hasn't been defined.  If you are trying to make up your own exception, @MattDMo points you to how to go about it.  If you want to use an existing exception, <code>IOError</code> seems most appropriate.</p>

<p>Import the exception if you are aware of which module it belongs to:</p>
<pre><code>from my.exception.module import NotADirectoryError
</code></pre>
<p>If not, you must define this class:</p>
<pre><code>class NotADirectoryError(Exception):
    pass
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Exceptions, generally, are classes.  You have to create a NotADirectoryError class that is a subclass of something, probably exceptions.OSError since that's what the os module will raise in that case.</p>
