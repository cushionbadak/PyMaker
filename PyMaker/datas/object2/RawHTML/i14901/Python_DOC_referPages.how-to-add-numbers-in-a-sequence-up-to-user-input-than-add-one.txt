<p>I'm taking an online introductory computer science class for Python. A homework problem says the inventor of chess asked for a grain of rice. 1 grain on the first day, 2 on the second, four grains on the third day, eight on the fifth day...all the way to 68 days. I have to create a function that does this, returning the number of grains for the number of squares entered. </p>
<p>I believe all I have to do is get the number of squares from user. Add up all the multiples of two up to the point of the user's input then sum by one. I have no idea how to do this. That's whats irritating; you can know what to do, but not how to do it. </p>
<pre><code>def function(li):
    for i in range(len(li))
    #I need a loop that adds all the multiples of 2 up to the point of the user's input than returns that value. 
    function()
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The same can be accomplished by looking at the sequence <code>1,2,4,8...</code>as <code>2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3...</code> you can create a simple function  that will give you the amount based on the number of days.</p>
<pre><code>def fun(days):
    return 2**(days-1)

print fun(64)
9223372036854775808
</code></pre>

<p>As per your logic the grains start at 1 and keep doubling from the previous day</p>
<p>first day: 1 (2**0)</p>
<p>second day: 2 (2**1)</p>
<p>third day: 4 (2**2)</p>
<p>fourth day: 8 (2**3)</p>
<p>So on the fourth day there will be a total of <code>2**0 + 2**1 + 2**2 + 2**3</code></p>
<p>Using the formula:</p>
<pre><code>x**0 + x**1 + x**2 + x**3 .. x**m =  (x**(m+1) - 1)/(x-1)
</code></pre>
<p>we get <code>2**(m+1) -1</code> when <code>x =2</code></p>
<p>So on the fourth day (i.e. m=3 since we started with zero based index) the total grains would be <code>2**4 -1 =15</code></p>
<p>Based on above logic your function should be:</p>
<pre><code>def totalGrains(days):
    return 2**days - 1
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It isn't squaring, it is doubling each time.  Write out in "pseudo-code" (plain English) how you think it should work and we can help make it work like that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is a math question, not a Python question, really. Doubling up every square is simply a powers-of-two calculation. There is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#the-power-operator" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python operator for that</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for replying! You're right it's power of two! I think it should work like this:                                                                                                              get input from user,  return value of exponet minus one of user input,  Example: if user input=4 	then program computes 2**3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">afaik thats just the number of grains on the 3rd day</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JoranBeasley, actually that's the number of grains on day 4. I think my answer has a reasonable explanation on how this should be calculated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! It's amazing how simple it is!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah i remember I had the same problem in a math class and the answer was just to look at the sequence pattern</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TannerLancaster if this is the answer you were looking for, could you accept it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, how do I do that? I'm new here.</span>
