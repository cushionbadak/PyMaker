<p>I'd like to know how I can easily generate a list based on the values/order of two other lists:</p>
<pre><code>list_a = ['web1','web2','web3','web1','web4']
list_b = ['web2','web4','web1','web5','web1']
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like to retrieve the "list_b" list ordered by value from "list_a":</p>
<pre><code>final = ['web1','web2','web1','web4','web5']
</code></pre>
<p>If an entry exist on list_b but not on list_a, then the value is appended to the list at the end.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where to start, my initial thinking was to retrieve all the indexes with enum <code>[i for i, x in enumerate(mylist) if x==value]</code>, then sort the list, but I'm having hard time managing entries with multiples index (eg: web1) . Just wondering if you guys are thinking about an easy way to achieve this ?</p>

<p>An extremely simplistic way would be to just iterate over <code>list_a</code>, and should you find each element in <code>list_b</code> you remove it and append it to a list. Then after iterating all that remains in <code>list_b</code> are the elements that you need to add to the end of your list. </p>
<pre><code>list_a = ['web1','web2','web3','web1','web4']
list_b = ['web2','web4','web1','web5','web1']

front = []
for ele in list_a:
    if ele in list_b:
        front.append(ele)
        list_b.remove(ele)

final = front + list_b
print(final)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Outputs</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>['web1', 'web2', 'web1', 'web4', 'web5']
</code></pre>

<p>Another trickier way would be to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow"><code>collections.Counter</code></a> and a few list comprehensions, leveraging the set intersection and difference of the counters. </p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

cnt_a, cnt_b = Counter(list_a), Counter(list_b)
intersct = (cnt_a &amp; cnt_b)
diff = (cnt_b - cnt_a)

final = [a for a in list_a if a in intersct] + [b for b in list_b if b in diff]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">"I'd like to retrieve the "list_b" list ordered by value from "list_a":" - can you please provide more information about this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand your sorting mechanism - how do you determine which value is where?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just iterate over list_a asking if element in list_a in list_b, keep adding it to the third list final while removing the matched item from list_b. Then append the remaining contents of list_b at the end of final? What will you gain by sorting the list?</span>
