<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am trying to write a small script that will allow me to see information related to the cookies set by my website.</p>
<p>I want to know if it has <code>secure</code> or <code>httpOnly</code> flags set on them. But so far I wasn't able to do it, I only figured out how to get cookie names and values. Here is my current code:</p>
<pre><code>r = requests.post('url', data=data, headers=headers)

for (name, cookie) in r.cookies.items():
    print name, cookie
</code></pre>
<p>So far this works fine, but I want to get information <em>related</em> to the cookies, not the value itself. Cookie meta-data if you will.</p>
<p>How can I achieve that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can extract the information from each cookie individually:</p>
<pre><code>import requests

r = requests.post('http://www.about.com')

for cookie in r.cookies:
    print(cookie.__dict__)
    print(cookie.secure)
</code></pre>
<p>This is because <code>r.cookies</code> is an instance of <code>RequestsCookieJar</code> which extends from <code>CookieJar</code> (Python 2: <code>cookielib.CookieJar</code>, Python 3: <code>http.cookiejar.CookieJar</code>). A <code>CookieJar</code> has <code>Cookie</code> objects.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I have not found a way to retrieve the <code>httponly</code> value from a <code>Cookie</code> object. In Python 3, you can define a <code>Mosel</code> object via a dictionary, and it considers <code>httponly</code> to be a standard attribute of a cookie (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html</a>), but I couldn't find any reference to <code>httponly</code> in the defining specification RFC2109 (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt</a>).</p>
<p>That said, if <code>httponly</code> is in fact a non-standard attribute, then you can use the following to check if a cookie has it:
<code>cookie.has_nonstandard_attr('httponly')</code></p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You can simply <code>for cookie in r.cookies:</code> and you also don't need to import the print_function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I edited my answer!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah nice :) but I saw that it doesn't work for <code>httpOnly</code>. At least not on 2.7. Is there a way to reach that one?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RodrigoSasaki, I'm not entirely sure about this, but it seems <code>httponly</code> is not part of the standard attributes expected in a cookie according to RFC2109 (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ietf.org/rfc/rfc2109.txt</a>). You can check if a cookie contains non standard attributes though like so <code>cookie.has_nonstandard_attr('httponly')</code>. Though there's contradicting evidence that <code>httponly</code> may also be valid (see: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/http.cookies.html#http.cookies.Morsel" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3.5/library/â€¦</a>). Just can't find a single reference to it in the RFC2109 document.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@HEADLESS_0NE, I see.. I was just curious really, but I can take care of it from now on :) Thank you for your help!</span>
