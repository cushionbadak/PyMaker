<p>Is it possible to make a variable in Python that is equal to any number greater than another number? For example:</p>
<pre><code>x = &gt;26
</code></pre>
<p>pretty much for those who are wondering what i am trying to do I am trying to make it so if a  number in a list of integers is over 26 then take that number and change it to a number under 26 depending on what number it is. Sorry this is one small thing in a bigger project so its hard to explain it all</p>

<p>Yes, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__eq__" rel="nofollow">you can customize your class's behaviour in comparison operations</a> to get this behaviour.</p>
<pre><code>class EqualToAnyGreaterThan(object):
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return other &gt; self.n

    def __ne__(self, other):
        return other &lt;= self.n


egt26 = EqualToAnyGreaterThan(26)

print egt26 ==  1 # False
print egt26 == 26 # False 
print egt26 == 27 # True 
print egt26 == 99 # True

print 21 == egt26 # False
print 89 == egt26 # True

print 21 != egt26 # True
print 89 != egt26 # False
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>obviously we can't do every number greater than 26 because that's infinity but there are a couple options.</p>
<pre><code>x = xrange(27, int(1e7)) #will return a generator of 27, 10000000
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">No, but you could make a lambda. <code>f = lambda x: x &gt;=26</code> then use <code>if f(12): ...</code> EDIT: nm, use the rich objects @JeremyBanks recommended.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's the use case? Why do you need this magic variable, what are you trying to do here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Bill and I interpreted your question differently. Could you indicate which you meant? A magic variable that can be compared, or a single random value satisfying your criteria?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Brilliant idea! never thought of doing it this way!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">lol true i guess i could do this</span>
