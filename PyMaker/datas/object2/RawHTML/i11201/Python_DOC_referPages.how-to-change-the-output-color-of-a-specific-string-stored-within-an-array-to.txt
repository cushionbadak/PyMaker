<p>I'm writing a small RPG in Python, and I want my different world objects to have varying colors.  I've tried exploring colorama and some similar modules; however, the string always prints as a small box with some numbers and letters in it, instead of, let's say, a blue '~' character for a water tile.  </p>
<p>I create my world arrays with a variable that looks like this: </p>
<pre><code>worldArray = [[' ' for i in range(10)] for i in range(10)]
</code></pre>
<p>I then add world objects to it through a few different functions, to structure a random-esque world environment, like this one: </p>
<pre><code>def replacetiles(self, grid, row, a, b, char, count):
        while count:
            aShift = 2
            row_col_dict = {row: (a, b)}
            for row in row_col_dict.keys():
                startPos, endPos = row_col_dict[row]

                for i in range(startPos, endPos):
                    grid[row][i] = char

            row -= 1
            if aShift == 0:
                a += random.randint(1, 2)

            if count &lt; 3:
                b -= (b / 2)

            b += random.randint(0, 1)
            aShift -=1
            count -= 1
</code></pre>
<p>This is of course all stored within a class object. This function is how I create randomized oceans within the world, by calling <code>replacetiles(gamemap, 9, 0, 5, '~', 3)</code> which would replace a few of the indexes with <code>'~'</code>.</p>
<p>How would I be able to change the output color of the <code>'~'</code> within the game map? </p>
<p>EDIT: My question seems much more specific than the other thread listed.  The problem I am having, is when I print text through colorama, or any of the answers below or in the other thread, in a stand alone file simply printing colored text, it works.  However, when I use that same code to change the color of the <code>char</code> argument in <code>replacetiles</code>, I get this odd box icon, regardless of the method I used to change the color of the string text.</p>

<p>You can use this package called termcolor, instead of hard coding the values.</p>
<pre><code>import sys
from termcolor import colored, cprint

text = colored('Hello, World!', 'red', attrs=['reverse', 'blink'])
print(text)
cprint('Hello, World!', 'green', 'on_red')
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can add ASCII escape codes to the strings you add to your <code>worldArray</code>. To make your water blue, just replace <code>grid[row][i] = char</code> with <code>grid[row][i] = "\033[34m" + char + "\033[0m"</code>.</p>
<p>For more color codes, see:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors</a></p>
<p>You can then print your world using:</p>
<pre><code>print('\n'.join(' '.join(row) for row in worldArray))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What os/console are you using?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Newest version of Linux Mint available and the standard terminal.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Possible duplicate of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/287871/print-in-terminal-with-colors-using-python">Print in terminal with colors using Python?</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also returns the weird box icon.  If I run this in its own file, I get the highlighted red text.  However, if I try to attach similar code into my function to change the <code>'~'</code> blue, I see the box icons. Any idea why that might be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What terminal emulation are you using?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have a fresh install of the newest version of Linux Mint, using the standard terminal. I added a screenshot to the main post for clarification.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's an encoding problem, your are most likely trying to print a unicode character but your terminal doesn't support it. Try encoding the string or the single character with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=encode#str.encode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No results from that.  My code is now: <code>grid[row][i] = char.encode('utf-8', 'strict')</code> Is this correct? The <code>char</code> argument being: <code>colored('w', 'blue', attrs=['reverse', 'blink'])</code> I also changed the <code>'~'</code> symbol to a <code>'w'</code> instead to see if for some reason that would make a difference.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This doesn't seem to be working.  Still returns the strange box thing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you paste what you see?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Added a screen shot to my main post.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, how are you actually printing your world?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print '\n'.join(' '.join(*zip(*row)) for row in gamemap)</code> for the whole map.</span>
