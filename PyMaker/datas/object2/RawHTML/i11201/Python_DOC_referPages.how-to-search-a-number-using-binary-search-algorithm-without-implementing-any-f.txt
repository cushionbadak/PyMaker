<p>Below is my complete code for binary search written in python3 version.
I was able to:-i) create a list, ii) sorted the list using bubble sort algorithm, iii)wrote code snippet for searching a number using binary search, 
But while searching for any number (which is present/not present in the list), my code goes into an infinite loop and does not gives any result. 
I tried looking for the error,But was unable to debug the code.</p>
<p>Also, how to get the index of the number in list? I thought of using list.index() method. Can it work in case of sorted list or my index number output will be wrongly displayed? </p>
<pre><code>list=[]
item=0
while item!="99":
    item=input("Enter the number, To discontinue enter 99:")

    if item.isdigit(): #isdigit() checks whether input string consists of digits only
        list.append(int(item)) #convert the input string into number
    else:
        list.append(item)

del list[-1] #Delete the number at last index of the list. It will delete "99",
             #which we have used to discontinue the loop

print("The unsorted list is: ",list)

#Using bubble sort algorithm to sort the list
length=len(list)

for i in range(length):
    for j in range(length-1):
        if list[j]&gt;list[j+1]:
            list[j],list[j+1]=list[j+1],list[j]

print("Our sorted list is: ",list)

#Implementing binary serach algorithm

target=int(input("Enter the number you are looking for: "))
first=0              #First index of list is 0
last=len(list)-1     #Last index of list is "length of list minus 1"
mid=(first+last)//2

while first&lt;=last:
    if list[mid]&lt;target:        #If element at middle index is less than the target element,shift new lower index to one more than middle index
        low=mid+1                     
    elif list[mid]==target:     #else, if element at middle index is same as target element
        print("Number is found at index")
        break
    else:
        last=mid-1
    mid=(first+last)//2
    if (first&gt;last):
        print("Number not found in list")

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The infinite loop is from the line</p>
<pre><code>low=mid+1
</code></pre>
<p>I think what you meant was</p>
<pre><code>last=mid+1
</code></pre>
<p>The error was that the case <code>list[mid]&lt;target</code> would happen, but since <code>low</code> is being changed not <code>last</code>, <code>mid</code> never changes the case will be triggered again on the next iteration.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also note that <code>mid</code> is the index of the number in the list</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the motivation for not implementing any function? That seems like an arbitrary restriction which is almost guaranteed to lead to bad code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">From the context, I bet this is homework, and what actually <i>was</i> in the question is he should not use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">standard python function</a>, but that bit got misinterpreted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You sometimes use <code>first</code> and sometimes <code>low</code> in your code. Probably the origin of the bug. Choose which it is and rename the other.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is a part of assignment only and focused on to get it done without implementing function including standard python built ins.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You were absolutely right. Thanks for that catch. Perhaps I got messed up with so many terms(first, last, mid) and complex algorithm and made that mistake...</span>
