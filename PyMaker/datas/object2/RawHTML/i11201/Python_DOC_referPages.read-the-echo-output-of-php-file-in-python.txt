<p>I have a database on backendless cloud service which has no support for python.</p>
<p>So i'm establishing the connection between the python code and the database using php files.</p>
<p>The insertion is working fine as there is no response from the php file to the python.</p>
<p>However in the retrieving i need the php file to echo the output and the python script to read this echo value. How can i do this?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Use the <code>subprocess</code> module to execute the PHP code from python.</p>
<p>Assuming that your PHP script write to standard output <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output" rel="nofollow"><code>subprocess.check_output()</code></a> would be the easiest, or you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen" rel="nofollow"><code>subprocess.Popen()</code></a> if you need better control of the child process.</p>
<p>If you are using Python &gt;= 3.5 then you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run" rel="nofollow"><code>subprocess.run()</code></a>.</p>

<p>To read from stdout with python you can use subprocess module</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
p = subprocess.Popen("ls",stdout=subprocess.PIPE) # in your case, "ls" change with php command
print p.communicate()  # here you will get ls output
</code></pre>
<p>But I don't think that this is a good solution to solve your problem. A better solution will be to use php as REST service. And then with python use it as REST.</p>
<pre><code>import json
import urllib2
json.load(urllib2.urlopen("htt://yourphpapplicationaddress.com"))
</code></pre>

<p>try to use pipe, for example:</p>
<pre><code>php test.php | grep 'xxx' python text.python
</code></pre>
<p>that's it, python can get the echo data of php from sys.argv</p>
