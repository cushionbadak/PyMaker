<p>I am new to python and I am just beginning to learn the syntax. I would like to create a map (like in java but I understand that they may be called something else in python) so I would assume the code might look something like this </p>
<pre><code>map = {}
map.append("somestring": 12)
map.append("anotherstring": 10)
map.append("yetanotherstring": 15)
'''
then organize the map by the numbers from largest to smallest
so if I were to then run through the map with a for loop it would
print 
"yetanotherString" : 15
"somestring" : 12
"anotherstring" : 10
'''
</code></pre>
<p>I am clueless In almost every step of this process from declaring a "map" to organizing it by the ints. Though organizing it by the ints is my biggest problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>They're called <em>dictionaries</em>!</p>
<p>Try like this:</p>
<pre><code>pythonDict = {}

pythonDict['somestring'] = 12
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">If youâ€™re new to Python, then please spend some time with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the tutorial</a>.

<span class="comment-copy">Please don't name your variable <code>map</code> because you overwrite the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>map</code></a> function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you!! how do I then organize It by the ints though?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">See my edit about itertools! You can also mark my answer as accepted if it solved your problem!</span>
