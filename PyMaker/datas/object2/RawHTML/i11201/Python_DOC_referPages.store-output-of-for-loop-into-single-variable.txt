<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a for loop that retrieves bigram data of a page of text from an SQLite3 database.</p>
<pre><code>def bigram_db():
cursr.execute("SELECT * FROM trainedGrammar")
data = cursr.fetchall()
for data in data:
    element = data
    txt = element[0] #fetch first element of list
    txt += txt
return txt
</code></pre>
<p>I tried using txt += txt but this only gives me a single paragraph worth bigram data when I tried to print cache outside the function bigram_db(). So how do I store all of the bigram data that is going to be output by the for loop, which can be <strong>accessed outside of the for loop</strong> and then when I print it, I want the entire bigram data of the database to be available. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You don't need to execute <code>fetchall()</code>, you can iterate directly on the cursor. And you cannot use the same variable <code>txt</code> for two purposes; in the loop, the line <code>txt = element[0]</code> overwrites its old value.</p>
<p>Your function should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>def bigram_db():
    cursr.execute("SELECT * FROM trainedGrammar")
    txt = ""
    for row in cursr:
        txt += row[0]
    return txt
</code></pre>
<p>Or without a for loop:</p>
<pre><code>def bigram_db():
    cursr.execute("SELECT * FROM trainedGrammar")
    return "".join([row[0] for row in cursr])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">data structure</a> do you want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CL.,but the problem is it only gives me one paragraph of data, there is actually 4. But when I type "print txt" within the for loop, it gives me all 4 paragraphs I want to do the same but outside the for loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">First of all, use better naming (you are using data twice). better do <code>for row in data:</code> and also remove the redundant assignment <code>element = data</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@dnaranjo Thanks for the advice! yah, it's redundant...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I was looking for this.</span>
