<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Is it possible to put items on the top of a Queue instead of the bottom?
In same cases I need to re-popoulate the Queue by mantaining the original order after that I've get items.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>No, by definition, putting into a queue is to the end.</p>
<p>You want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque" rel="nofollow">deque</a> instead.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Use a double ended queue maybe? <code>from collections import Deque</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, by definition of a queue, putting and getting happens on different ends.</span>
