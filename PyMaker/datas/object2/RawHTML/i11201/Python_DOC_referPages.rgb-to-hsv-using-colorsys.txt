<p>i am trying to make a tracking program that takes an image and displays where the the object with the specified color is: </p>
<p>example: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8LR40" rel="nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/8LR40</a></p>
<p>to do this i am using RGB right now but it is realy hard to work with it so i want to convert it into a hue so it is easier to work with. i am trying to use colorsys but after doing some research i have no idea what parameters it wants in and what it gives. i have tried to get a match using colorizer.org but i get some nonsence.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import colorsys
&gt;&gt;&gt; colorsys.rgb_to_hsv(45,201,18)
(0.3087431693989071, 0.9104477611940298, 201)
</code></pre>
<p>alredy the colorsys is not acting as documented because at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/colorsys.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/colorsys.html</a> it says that the output is always a float between 0 and 1, but the value is 201. that also is impossible as in standard HSV the value is between 0 and 100.</p>
<p>my questions are:
what does colorsys expect as an input?
how do i convert the output to standard HSV? (Hue = 0-360, saturation = 0-100, value = 0-100)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Coordinates in all of these color spaces are floating point values. In the YIQ space, the Y coordinate is between 0 and 1, but the I and Q coordinates can be positive or negative. In all other spaces, the coordinates are all between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>You must scale from 0 - 255 to 0 - 1, or divide your RGB values with 255. If using python 2 make sure not to do floor division.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">thank you. the flooring division was the problem as i am using python 2 on a raspberry pi(the default) and i tried this before but only got 0.0 answers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mateuszdrwal "The default?", there is no such thing as python 2 is my <i>default python</i>, as PEP394 says, <code>python</code> is expectedly python 2 on all systems <i>("for the time being, all distributions should ensure that python refers to the same target as python2")</i>, use <code>python3</code> for the preferred Python 3 version. Notably, Ubuntu 16.04 doesn't ship with python 2 any more by default (you must install it manually), but the python 3 interpreter is still called <code>python3</code>, and if you then actually install <code>python-2.7</code>, then you will get the <code>/usr/bin/python -&gt; python2.</code>7 as well.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AnttiHaapala the thing i ment by "default" is that if i create a .py file on my rpi it will open in IDLE for python 2.7.9 unless i tell it otherwise</span>
