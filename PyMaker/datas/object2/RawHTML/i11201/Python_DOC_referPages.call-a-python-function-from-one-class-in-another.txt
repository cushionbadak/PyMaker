<p><code>import</code> is not <code>#include</code>.  It automatically namespaces everything to the imported name.  Your first example should look like this</p>
<pre><code>import b
from ConfigParser import SafeConfigParser

class A:
  def method1:
    config = SafeConfigParser()
    c = b.B()
    c.method2(config)
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how I had to do <code>b.B()</code> to get the <code>B</code> class, because it was namespaced to <code>b</code>, the module that was imported.</p>
<p>Python is not staticly-typed.  You could pass any object into <code>B.method2()</code>.  You're expecting your editor to auto-complete for the <code>SafeConfigParser</code> object because that's what you're passing to it in <code>A</code>, but that's just one instance.  Python (and your editor) has no way of knowing all the possible types of your arguments you may pass to <code>method2()</code> (unless you're using type hinting, which is a fairly new feature, and still doesn't enforce variable types, it would simply be for display purposes in your editor).</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are two possible reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The hint doesn't show up because this code has typos and will not run anyway. You're missing <code>()</code> after <code>method1</code> and a colon after <code>method2(config)</code>. Also your <code>B</code> class will not be automatically visible, you should refer to it as <code>b.B</code> in your <code>a.py</code> file.</p></li>
<li><p>Your editor doesn't guess at all the possible program flows. For example you could call <code>method2</code> from some other place with a string or integer or anything else as a parameter. The editor is just guessing here, so it's just as likely to not give you any hints.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Without saying what the editor is, it's hard to say what the real reason is. Fix the code first, then look for specific answers.</p>
<p>If you're using python &gt; 3.5, then you can use type hints which may help as well. (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/" rel="nofollow">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/</a>)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can something similar to what you're looking for with the <code>dir()</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir" rel="nofollow">function in python3</a>. This will print everything that's in the scope of the variable. Just change your <code>b.py</code> file to this:</p>
<pre><code>class B:
  def method2(config)
    print(dir(config))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What error are you getting?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@nbryans I do not get an error. But I just expect the python interpreter to show me the inbuilt methods of config. Is my understanding wrong</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The editor has no way to tell what methods <code>config</code> has, especially with the syntax error in <code>def method1:</code>. Depending on your editor, it might not even do autocomplete.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What editor?  PyDev (and others) you can use <code>assert isinstance(config, SafeConfigParser)</code> which will hint to the editor what class an object represents and code completion will "work" again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think that op is looking for something similar to the functionality that you get in an IDE like Eclipse or something. Is that right?</span>
