<p>In my document I would like to add scores to a chosen line using:</p>
<pre><code>file = open('scores.txt', 'a')
</code></pre>
<p>because I don't want to add all the lines to a list and change that one line.
I'm basically asking if you can add something to <code>.write()</code> or <code>.writelines()</code> to choose the line that it writes onto. If not, any other ways? If not, maybe a simple way of adding to a list then changing a line.</p>
<p>basically what the txt document looks like:</p>
<pre><code>User 1 scores:
15,
User 2 Scores:
20,
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The best way to store data to store some kind of user informations is Serialization. You have several modules including Pickle (which serialize the object into a binary file, and later can deserialize this object by reading the file, giving you the exact same object as it was before serialization), or Json.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a good solution, but still want to be able to clearly read data (Since Pickle is storing the data as a binary entity object, you can't read it clearly), use JSON.</p>
<p>It's very simple for this basic use :</p>
<p>If you have for example this same structure as you showed before:</p>
<pre><code>User 1 scores:
15,
User 2 scores:
20,
</code></pre>
<p>You can make it as a dictionary, for example like that:</p>
<pre><code>scores = {
    'User 1': 15,
    'User 2': 20,
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which makes it even easier to edit and use, since to access the User 1 score, all you need to type is <code>scores['User 1']</code>.</p>
<p>Now, for the serialization part of this dictionary, to save it into a file, you can obtain a serialized string representing the dict using the <code>json.dumps(&lt;your array&gt;)</code> function. Used like that:</p>
<pre><code>import json
dictionary = { 'User 1': 15, 'User 2': 20 }
print(json.dumps(dictionary))
</code></pre>
<p>The print will show you how it's represented. As a JSON compliant file.
You just need a simple <code>file.write()</code> to save it, and a <code>file.read()</code> to retrieve it.</p>
<p>(After test, using json.dumps on your example give me that: <code>{"User 2": 20, "User 1": 15}</code>)</p>
<p>To retrieve that data, you'll need to use the <code>json.loads(&lt;json string&gt;)</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>import json
# As you can see, string representation of json.
dictionary = json.loads("{"User 2": 20, "User 1": 15}")
</code></pre>
<p>Your dict is now loaded &amp; saved !</p>

<p>Hope that helps !</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>For your information, Python native file IO module only give 1 function to change the position of the read buffer in the file, and that function is <code>file.seek()</code> function, that moves you into a specific byte in the file. (you need to pass the byte address as a function parameter, for example <code>file.seek(0, 0)</code> will position you at the beginning of the file). </p>
<p>You can get your position in the file using <code>file.tell()</code> function.</p>
