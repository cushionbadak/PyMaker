<p>I'm trying to install Tweepy using pip, but I keep getting this as the response:

<p>I've seen similar problems and people always suggest adding C:\Python34\Scripts to your PATH. Here is what happens when I try and do that:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hCwfI.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hCwfI.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then when I do echo %PATH% it doesn't show the path that I added. Using pip still does not work. </p>
<p>How do I make it to where I am able to use pip? I looked through multiple other questions that were VERY similar to mine, but none of the solutions worked.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help in advance!</p>

<p>I would recommend using this guide for adding a new folder to your system path, normally works for me. It goes through a GUI instead of adding through the command line.</p>

<p>A second solution is that you can just cd into the directory that contains pip and use it from there each time, but thats only if nothing else works.</p>

<p>It seems like you are using windows so you need to download the <code>get-pip.py</code> and run like this.</p>
<p><code>Path_to_your_Python.exe\python.exe Path_to_get-pip.py\get-pip.py tweepy</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">looks like youre using windows so ensure that you've <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4750806/how-do-i-install-pip-on-windows">installed <code>pip</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is C:\Python34 actually your Python directory?  Depending on what version how you installed and how, it might be something else.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, my directory is C:\Python34. I double checked just in case.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think that "WARNING" is probably the main issue here.  How long is the PATH variable exactly?  If it is in fact longer than 1024 characters, you'll want to check <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/387619/overcoming-the-1024-character-limit-with-setx" title="overcoming the 1024 character limit with setx">superuser.com/questions/387619/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">THIS WORKED. I LOVE YOU. THANK YOU. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python 3.4 ships with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pip included</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Same issue as before:  <a href="http://puu.sh/plA49/75d2bbe907.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes 3.4 has pip, I just can't seem to use it :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MoreFoam You have to mention the path towards the <code>python.exe</code> file. <code>Path_to_your_Python.exe\python.exe Path_to_get-pip.py\get-pip.py tweepy</code></span>
