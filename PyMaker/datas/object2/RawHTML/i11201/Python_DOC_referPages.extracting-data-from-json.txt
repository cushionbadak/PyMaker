<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a large JSON item returned through a REST API, I wont junk up this with the full text but here is the code I am currently using:</p>
<pre><code>import urllib2
import json
req =     urllib2.Request
('http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/
pollster/api/polls.json?state=IA')
response = urllib2.urlopen(req)
the_page = response.read()
decode = json.loads(the_page)
#print = decode #removed, because it is not actually related to the question
print decode
</code></pre>
<p>I have been trying to extract information out of it such as the date polls are updated, the actual data from the polls etc (particularly the presidential polls) but I am having trouble returning any data at all. Can anyone assist?</p>
<p>EDIT:
The actual question is how to query data from the returned array/dict</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is, that you overwrite <code>print</code> with your data, instead of printing the data. Just remove the <code>=</code> in the last line and it should work fine:
</p>
<pre><code>print decode
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to use Python 3, you need parenthesis for <code>print</code>. This would look like this:
</p>
<pre><code>print(decode)
</code></pre>
<p>Edit: As you updated your question, here an answer to your actual question: The data is returned as a combination of dicts and lists by the <code>loads</code> function. Hence you can also access the data like a dict/list. For example, to get the <code>last_updated</code> field of all polls in one list, you can do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>all_last_updated = [poll['last_updated'] for poll in decode]
</code></pre>
<p>Or to just get the end date of all polls sponsored by "Constitutional Responsibility Project", you could do this:</p>
<pre><code>end_dates = [poll['end_date'] for poll in decode if any(sponsor['name'] == 'Constitutional Responsibility Project' for sponsor in poll['sponsors'])]
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you just want the id of the first poll in the list, do:</p>
<pre><code>the_id = decode[0]['id']
</code></pre>
<p>You access anything you want from the json in a similar way.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>it is because you do</p>
<pre><code>print = decode
</code></pre>
<p>instead, if you are using python 2 do</p>
<pre><code>print decode
</code></pre>
<p>or in python 3 do</p>
<pre><code>print(decode)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">you should read a bit on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html</a> Data sctructures, and get back to us with a concrete example of what you have attempted with any error message</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print = decode</code> What exactly are you trying to achieve??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Code works fine for me if you change <code>print = decode</code> to <code>print decode</code>. For more readable output to find which keys are for date polls and data, use <code>pprint.pprint(decode)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you using python2 or python3?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am using Python 2.7.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! The print = decode was a typo actually, i normally do print decode but i added it back in to be complete with my code despite it not being relevant to what i am asking. Unfortunately i dont think i have been very clear with my question. I get returns such as :[{u'last_updated': u'2016-06-16T15:48:18.784+00:00', u'end_date': u'2016-06-13', u'pollster': u'PPP (D-Constitutional Responsibility Project)', u'affiliation': u'Dem', u'partisan': u'Sponsor', u'survey_houses': and i want to extract information from this, how would i do that? â€“</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just updated my answer to match the updated question. Does this help you figure out how to get the data you want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you! This was very very helpful! cal I return lists in this fashion? for example, there is a section of polls for {"name":"Registered Voters","observations":630,"margin_of_error":3.9,"responses":  and the value for "responses" is the actual poll date. How would I retrieve that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well first you need to get the <code>poll</code>/s (maybe filtered as shown above), then you get the list of <code>questions</code> and again select the one/filter the ones wanted. Again the same for the <code>subpopulations</code>. After that you can just get the <code>responses</code> list from you subpopulation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">would it be some variation of what you provided with end_dates = [poll['end_date'] for poll in decode if any(sponsor['name'] == 'Constitutional Responsibility Project' for sponsor in poll['sponsors'])] except change it to select for candidate names (ie Clinton). How would I then query the "value" field of that list? I want to get values associated with the candidate. I'm sorry i'm just a little confused on how to do this and I really appreciate your assistance!</span>
