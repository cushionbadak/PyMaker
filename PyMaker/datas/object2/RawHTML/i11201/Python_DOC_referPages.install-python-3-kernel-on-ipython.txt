<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I know the question has been asked in the past but couldnt find a satisfying solution.</p>
<p>i want to add a python 3 kernel on ipython
here the "official" instructions seems quite straightforward
<a href="https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/kernel_install.html" rel="nofollow">https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/kernel_install.html</a></p>
<p>however i receive the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:\Users\Vincent&gt;python3 -m pip install ipykernel 'python3' is not
  recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or
  batch file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is on a windows system.</p>
<p>any idea whats wrong?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Found the solution:
windows uses the command py -3 instead of python3 that was suggested in the docs posted above;</p>
<p>Sorry if that was abs obvious for all..</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you be more specific and post the error you get?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Having had a look at the site you refer to, I'm inclined to say you're following the install instructions for a linux environment rather than Windows? a number of the example commands are preceded by a <code>$</code> which is the linux/unix command prompt character?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Windows can't find your python 3 executable. It has a different name, or it's in a directory that is not on the system $PATH. Here's the official documentation about installing and using python under windows. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">hi yes my python 3 is not on the system path because otherwise i think it will create confusion between python 2 and 3 no? or i will need to rename 1 of the python.exe, which i dont like either?</span>
