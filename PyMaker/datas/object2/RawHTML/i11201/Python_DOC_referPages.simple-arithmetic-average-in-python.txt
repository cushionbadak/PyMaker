<p>I'm a total newbie on Python and I would like to calculate the arithmetic average.</p>
<pre><code>a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

average=sum(a)/len(a)

print('The average is:' ,average)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm aware that such code do solve my problems but that is not exactly what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>I want the user to be able to type the number of terms of the arithmetic average and I would like him to be able of typing them separatley on different lines. So I thought the right thing to use was For Loop. I came out with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>n = input('Number of terms')

for i in range (1,int(n)+1):

    a=input('Term number '+str(int(i))+': ')
</code></pre>
<p>I know that all I need to do know is to find a way to sum all values of a typed on each loop and divide this number by <code>int(n)</code> but I have no idea how to do that.</p>
<p>Can you guys help me with that?</p>
<p>Thanks everyone!</p>

<pre><code>n = input('Number of terms')
acc = 0
for i in range(1,int(n)+1):
    a=input('Term number '+str(int(i))+': ')
    acc += float(a)
print('The average is ',acc/int(n))
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is to create an accumulator variable <code>acc</code> to which the entered numbers are added. After the loop <code>acc</code> is equal to the sum of all numbers entered. Divide it by the number of terms and you get the arithmetic average.</p>

<p>Try:</p>
<pre><code>n = int(input('Number of terms'))
sum = 0
for i in range (1,n+1):
    a=int(input('Term number '+str(i)+': '))
    sum += a
avg = sum/n

<span class="comment-copy">If you are using Python 3, <code>input</code> returns a string. Not an integer (or floating point) number. If you're using Python 2 instead, you shouldn't be using <code>input</code> but <code>raw_input</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since you want to save a <i>sequence</i> of values, it's natural to use some kind of <i>sequence</i> type, what about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Evert, I'm using Python 3. And Rogalski, I'm not sure how to use lists properly so I tried to solve this with only the very basic knowledge I have. hehe</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Isn't it word for word the same as my answer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, I see! I had a problem using this accumulator variable. I'll read more about this. I think the problem has ben solved haha. Thanks :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried your code but I got this error message:  "line 8, in &lt;module&gt;     a*=a TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'"</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>a</code> is an <code>int</code>. We explicitly cast it as <code>int</code> in <code>a=int(input('Term number '+str(i)+': '))</code>. Are you sure you cast it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes I did. I just ctrl+c ctrl+v what your answer. I'm using Python 3 btw.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>a</code> should be a float to allow the user to enter non-integral numbers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ThePiercingPrince It is an example code!</span>
