<p>When this code is run, why a exception is not thrown since the function compare called within sort function has not been given exactly two arguments?
when the code is run it gives the output as,</p>

5

<p>You are not calling directly the function</p>
<p>You are passing to the sort function a 'pointer' or a 'reference' to the function that will be used as a comparator</p>
<p>if you need more debugging info add a line that print what is being compared as follow</p>
<pre><code>L=[5,10,4,2,8,7]
def compare(a,b):
    print 'comparing ',a,b
    return cmp(b,a)

L.sort(compare)
</code></pre>
<p>and you will also notice that the number of calls depends on L dis-order</p>
<p>there are several ways to solve the problem of order an array
some of that are merge-sort , binary-sort and still others</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are not calling compare in L.sort(compare). You are just passing a reference to the function that will be called internally by sort. </p>
<p>You don't need any other arguments for that. Remember that in order to call a function you use (), so if you were actually calling it you would have written L.sort(compare())</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you assume that <code>compare()</code> isn't called with two arguments? You pass <code>compare()</code> as the <code>cmp</code> argument to <code>list.sort()</code> and the callback gets called with two arguments.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">He obviously didn't understand the meaning of the snippet he posted, this is why he is asking</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So how does the sort function define the a,b parameters?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't. It just expects a function that it can call. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list.sort</a></span>
