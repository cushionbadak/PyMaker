<p>I'm trying to write a text adventure. At the beginning, it asks whether a person is male or female. If they input "male", I want it to use the words him, his and he. if they input "female", I want it to use the words her and she etc.</p>
<pre><code>print ("Is that person male or female?")
gender = input ()
if gender == "male":
    1 = his
    2 = he
    3 = him
else:
    1 = her
    2 = she
    3 = her
</code></pre>
<p>I want the words to show up when I put in the numbers for example:</p>
<pre><code>print (2,"went with", 3,)
</code></pre>
<p>This should say <code>"he went with him"</code>, or <code>"she went with her"</code>, But it doesn't.</p>
</div>

<pre><code>gender = input("Is that person male or female? ")

    two = "she"
    three = "her"
print(one+' item that '+two+' had was for '+three)
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of how it could look like.</p>

<p>Python variable name rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Must begin with a letter (a - z, A - B) or underscore (_)</li>
<li>Other characters can be letters, numbers or _</li>
<li>Case Sensitive</li>
<li>Can be any (reasonable) length</li>
<li>There are some reserved words which you cannot use as a variable name because Python uses them for other things.</li>
</ol>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> are not valid <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">identifiers</a> in Python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"This should say something, but it doesn't." That's an understatement for a syntax error. Anyway, you're also going to have to put <code>his</code> etc in quotes because right now it expects to find a variable called <code>his</code>, not a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that these are for 2.x not 3.x, which is a little freer with the definition of a letter (you can <code>from math import pi as Ï€</code>, for example!)</span>
