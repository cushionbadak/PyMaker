<p>I use PC to control extral device, and this device is serial port communicate with PC, and it works good. I can send the commands to device from PC to device. The belwo is command structure.Python versio is 2.7.</p>
<pre><code>Initialize=[0xEE,0x01,0x01] 
ser.write(Initialize)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I use the raspberry pi to connect this device, and I'm sure rapsberry pi has connected with thid device. I use the below command to test connection.</p>
<pre><code>ser=serial.Serial("/dev/ttyACM0", baudrate=115200, timeout=0.5)
print ("Port "+ ser.portstr + "opened:" + str(ser.isOpen()))
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the issue is I cannot write the data to device as I did in PC. The python version is 3.4.2.
Write command:</p>
<pre><code>Initialize=[0xEE,0x01,0x01] 
ser.write(Initialize)
</code></pre>
<p>Error message: </p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/pi/ssbar/ss.py", line 65, in &lt;module&gt;
    ser.write(Initialize)
  File "/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/serial/serialposix.py", line 475, in write
    n = os.write(self.fd, d)
TypeError: 'list' does not support the buffer interface
</code></pre>
<p>Is anyone knows how to fix it? Many thank for your help!</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer. It works now. The belwo is correct command.</p>
<pre><code>x=bytearray(Initialize)

<span class="comment-copy">In Python 3 I think you will have to convert your list Initialize into a byte stream.</span>
