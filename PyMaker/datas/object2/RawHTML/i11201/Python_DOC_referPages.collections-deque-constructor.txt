<p>Can you explain the this constructor of deque:</p>
<pre><code>import collections
buff = collections.deque([], 100)
</code></pre>
<p>I saw it's documentation but couldn't find this form being used anywhere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>class collections.deque([iterable[, maxlen]])</p>
<p>Returns a new deque object initialized left-to-right (using append())
  with data from iterable. If iterable is not specified, the new deque
  is empty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your example , <code>buff = collections.deque([], 100)</code>,</p>
<p>creates a new empty deque object <code>buff</code>, specified by the first argument, with maxlen 100. It means the deque object is bounded to a maximum length of 100.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.deque" rel="nofollow">link</a> to the documentation, it's explained nicely and pretty clear.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What about the documentation is unclear?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As you've found the documentation, focus on what <i>maxlen</i> argument does. It is very well explained. There's also an example of what you're after in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#deque-recipes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">deque recipes</a>. Look at the <i>tail</i> function.</span>
