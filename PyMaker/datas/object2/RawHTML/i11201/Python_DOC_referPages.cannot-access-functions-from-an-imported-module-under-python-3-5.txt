<p>I am trying to get a Python module called MTpy to run on my computer; this package allows handling and processing of magnetotelluric (geophysical) data.
I am using Python 3.5 with the Anaconda/Spyder IDE under Windows 10. 
I am just getting started with Python so I apologize if my question seems trivial!</p>
<p>My problem is, I can import the mtpy module and all of its submodules, but then I cannot call any of the functions contained in these subfolders.</p>
<p>For instance, mtpy contains a submodule called analysis.</p>
<p>I can successfully run:</p>
<pre><code>import mtpy.analysis
</code></pre>
<p>Running </p>
<pre><code>help(mtpy.analysis) 
</code></pre>
<p>will return:</p>
<pre><code>Help on package mtpy.analysis in mtpy:

NAME
    mtpy.analysis

PACKAGE CONTENTS
    distortion
    geometry
    niblettbostick
    pt
    staticshift
    zinvariants

FILE
    c:\users\sheldon\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\mtpy-0.0.1-py3.5.egg   \mtpy\analysis\__init__.py
</code></pre>
<p>However when trying to access the distortion.py function contained in the analysis folder, I get the following error message:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

File "&lt;ipython-input-56-16963e2f7b1c&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
mtpy.analysis.distortion()

AttributeError: module 'mtpy.analysis' has no attribute 'distortion'
</code></pre>
<p>FYI, both my module (mtpy) and submodule folders (e.g. analysis) contain the init file.  </p>
<p>Many thanks for your help!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Sheldon</p>

<p><code>distortion.py</code> <strong>isn't</strong> a function it's a sub package of <code>analysis</code> and <strong>it's not callable</strong>. You can methods which is defined in <a href="https://github.com/geophysics/mtpy/blob/master/mtpy/analysis/distortion.py" rel="nofollow">mtpy.analysis.distortion</a>. You can get more info on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow">python 3 modules tutorial</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hi Moses, many thanks for your quick reply. Sorry if I was not clear enough! A file called distortion.py is contained in the analysis folder. When typing mtpy.analysis.distortion() in the Python terminal, I obtain the aforementionned error message.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't treat a module that way. Do <code>from mtpy.analysis import distortion</code> then call functions in the <code>distortion</code> module by doing <code>distortion.foo()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Moses! I was able to call the functions in the "distortion" submodule using the syntax you suggested.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Many thanks for your reply, Andriy. I did not realize "distortion" was a submodule of "analysis". Your answer solved my issue!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Sheldon Hey, you are welcome,  if it solved your problem could you mark answer as accepted ?</span>
