<p>I need a script to copy all files larger than 5mb from a given folder to a new folder that the script needs to create on desktop. Then it needs to rename all files in increasing order also changing extension. 
For example files: slides.ppt, math.doc, essay.docx
to:lec1.doc, lec2.doc, lec3.doc</p>
<p>I got this script to work and it lists all files larger than 5mb:</p>
<pre><code>import os

# The directory that we are interested in
myPath = "C:\asd"

# The min size of the file in Bytes
mySize = '5000000'

# All the file paths will be stored in this list
filesList= []

for path, subdirs, files in os.walk(myPath):
    for name in files:
        filesList.append(os.path.join(path, name))

for i in filesList:
    # Getting the size in a variable
    fileSize = os.path.getsize(str(i))

    # Print the files that meet the condition
    if int(fileSize) &gt;= int(mySize):
        print("The File: " + str(i) + " is: " + str(fileSize) + " Bytes")
</code></pre>
<p>Now this prints out the list and the list is correct but how can I go from here?
I looked into os and glob but I'm having a hard time figuering this out.</p>
<p>Thank you guys for helping out.</p>

<p>Try the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html" rel="nofollow"><code>shutil</code></a> package. It handles high level file operations</p>
<pre><code>import shutil
#do something
shutil.move(source,destination)
</code></pre>
<p>where source and destination might be files or folders.<br/>
Just set destination to the final name of the file, instead of copying and then renaming.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the <code>rename</code> method from <code>os</code></p>
<pre><code>import os
os.rename(src, dst)
</code></pre>
<p>where the <code>src</code> is the original file or directory name and <code>dst</code> is the new name. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">start with a simple example, outside of your script. e.g. try <code>glob.glob('/path/to/files/*.doc')</code> and see what you get. search for rename in the python docs, there are at least two ways to do that (os and pathlib both offer a rename function).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">as I commented @Luca I got it working with shutil and have everything in new directory but now I cant get the os.rename to work.. posted the error and code above</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry. What have you tried?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">problem was that I used only filename in os.rename but I needed to include full path. Problem resolved! Thanks guys!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok I got my script working it copies all my files to the new directory    'destPath = "C:/Users/dquerzola/Desktop/scuola"' but now from here I can't do the rename</span>
<span class="comment-copy">'n=1 filenames = os.listdir(destPath)  for filename in filenames:     os.rename(filename, 'lezione'+str(n)+'.docx')'</span>
