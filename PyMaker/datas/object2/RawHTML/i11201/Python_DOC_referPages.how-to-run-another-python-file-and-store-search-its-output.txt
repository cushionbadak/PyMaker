<p>So I want to make an automatic SQL injector using sqlmap. 
What I want to do is after a SQL vulnerable link found it will launch sqlmap with parameters[ -u %s(vulnerable link) ] That's good. I think I'm going to do it with os.system(if there is better way please tell me). That part is ok.<br/>
But after that the sqlmap gives you database names. How can I catch that database names? Or maybe save all the output to a txt file and make it search for database names.(but it could be bad)</p>

<p>Don't sure It will help you but you can export all Python output of a Python script. To do that you can set <code>sys.stdout</code> to an file object. Here an example:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.stdout = open('file', 'w')
print 'test'
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>os.system()</code> does not allow you to capture output, and is considered deprecated.  Sounds like you need the <code>subprocess</code> module.  There are a few examples in the doc, and many more on the web.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you show output of sqlmap? And the exact result you want to be stored in DB?</span>
