<p>I have written a simple python script, and I need to run it as an executable, i.e., without the 'python' word at the beginning of the program. The script (simple_prog.py) is :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>#!C:\Python27\python.exe</p>
<p>print "Hello World"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever I am running the script as 'python simple_prog.py', it is printing the output alright, but without that, it is printing nothing (image below).</p>

<p>I have also referred to the "How do I make Python scripts executable?" section in the site <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#id3" rel="noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#id3</a>, from the stackoverflow question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4235834/how-to-make-python-scripts-executable-on-windows">How to make python scripts executable on Windows?</a> , but could not understand the solution.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Update :</p>
<p>Solved the problem from the stackoverflow link : <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11472843/set-up-python-on-windows-to-not-type-python-in-cmd">Set up Python on Windows to not type python in cmd</a></p>
<p>This is what I followed (image below)</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D2hdU.png" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="enter image description here" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/D2hdU.png"/></a></p>
<p>Please note the position of double-quotes in the ftype command.</p>
<p>The second command (simple_prog) ran successfully because I updated the PATHEXT variable by adding ".PY" in it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the responses as well as the downvotes.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong>
Install py2exe v0.6.9 which is compatible with python 2.7 </p>
<p><strong>Follow below Steps:</strong></p>
<p>1.Save your code in to test.py (or any name with .py extension) file. Make sure that the code works fine by running it using python. </p>
<p>2.Then create a new file with name setup.py and paste the following code in to it.</p>
<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe
setup(console=['test.py'])
</code></pre>
<p>3.Now it is time to run the script and create the executable. To build the executable, run "python setup.py py2exe" on the command prompt. </p>
<p>4.After Building the executable is finished. Now you can find test.exe in the \dist sub folder. Move to dist sub folder and run test.exe, you can see output in console.</p>
<p>Hope it helps you..!! </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I believe this is the solution you are looking for.
<a href="http://www.py2exe.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.py2exe.org/</a></p>
<p>It basically does what it says on the lid.
You can create a windows executable from your python script following the tutorial on their page.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-default-programs" rel="nofollow">associate</a> <code>.py</code> files to be run in Python. Of course, this approach requires Python to be installed, unlike converting to <code>.exe</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">what exactly are you looking for convert <code>.py</code> to <code>.exe</code> or you want to run the program without using<code>python</code> keyword</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Convert <code>.py</code> to <code>.exe</code> and make a extension name association are two different things. From your question I guess you ask the latter, but from the title you are asking the former.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Updated the title. I am asking for the latter</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you should elaborate on your link (summarize) otherwise this answer is not worth much</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I already did that... but why it's down voted??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well it used to be just a link - probably it happened just then ... now it looks better. Btw it doesn't mean links aren't allowed - you can still provide the link for an additional read or as a reference</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Checking the edit history this was indeed mostly likely down voted because it was just a link, and the people who down vote usually don't get back to these to up vote again. So I threw in a up vote because others who search on the Internet will probably end up here and this will help a few of them and is not worth the negative votes that might scare people off from this type of solution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't need to convert the python script to exe. I want it to run without the 'python' keyword, as explained in the question body. Updated the misleading title.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't think that's what the OP wants. It looks more like they just want to type <code>myscript.py</code> instead of <code>python myscript.py</code> a very common request.</span>
