<p>I want to access list items in a specific way. for an example</p>
<pre><code>l1 =[1,2,3,4,5]
</code></pre>
<p>now i want to access 3rd element in the list i.e 4 but i want the result in specific way.</p>
<p>I want program to get the 2nd element i.e 3 and using its index i want to find 3rd element.</p>
<p>in short </p>
<pre><code>print l1[index]

index2 = index+1

print l1[index2]
</code></pre>
<p>how can i accomplish this task? is there any other efficient way to do this task?</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<p>Here's an approach using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow"><code>enumerate</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i, elem in enumerate(l1):
...     print 'Current', elem
...     try:
...         print 'Next', l1[i+1]
...     except IndexError:
...         print '%d is the last item in the list' % elem
...         
</code></pre>
<p>This outputs</p>
<pre><code>Current 1
Next 2
Current 2
Next 3
Current 3
Next 4
Current 4
Next 5
Current 5
Next 5 is the last item in the list
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>You could also start enumerating at index 1 and not add to index when looking up the next item:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; for i, elem in enumerate(l1, start=1):
...     print 'Current', elem
...     try:
...         print 'Next', l1[i]
...     except IndexError:
...         print '%d is the last item in the list' % elem
...         
Current 1
Next 2
Current 2
Next 3
Current 3
Next 4
Current 4
Next 5
Current 5
Next 5 is the last item in the list
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<p>I want program to get the 2nd element i.e 3 and using its index i want to find 3rd element.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>i = 1         # Get the 2nd element
print l1[i+1] # Using its index find the 3rd element.
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What's the end goal? You can do <code>i = l1.index(4)</code> and then <code>l1[i+1]</code> but this only gives you back index for the first match (<code>['a', 'b', 'a'].index('a')</code> is <code>0</code>). What are you trying to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want to print i th element and using that its index i want to print i+1 th element</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What if <code>i</code>th element is the last one?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This question is confusing to me. I would think that you'd want <code>print l1[l1[index]]</code> but I don't think that that's what you want?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thats the other thing but i asked this question to perform some other task where i dont have to worry about this condition</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well let me try this one</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is a good use case for recursion imo.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, that's getting to the point lol. +1 :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe OP will, in explaining why this is wrong, shed more light on his requirement.</span>
