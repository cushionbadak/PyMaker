<p>I'm wondering if this is even possible. </p>
<p>Let's say, there are two files. </p>
<p>in a.py:</p>
<pre><code>class A()
</code></pre>
<p>in b.py:</p>
<pre><code>def x():  
def y():
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like to import a function x() from b.py to a.py's class A so that the class A has a method x.</p>
<p>so that i can use like this</p>
<pre><code>test = A()
test.x()
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>If the functions signature doesn't allow for an instance of <code>A</code> to be passed as the first argument the best you can do is make them <code>staticmethod</code>s:</p>
<pre><code>import b
class A:
    x = staticmethod(b.x)
    y = staticmethod(b.y)

test = A()
test.x()
</code></pre>
<p>However if you had functions that could take an <code>A</code> instance as the first argument then it would just be:</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    from b import x,y

test = A()
test.x()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Why not try it?</p>
<p><strong>a.py</strong></p>
<pre><code>class A():
    from b import x, y

a = A()
a.x()
</code></pre>
<p><strong>b.py</strong></p>
<pre><code>def x():
    print "Hi, I'm x!"


def y():
    print "Hi, I'm y!"
</code></pre>
<p>Yikes, that didn't work!</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "a.py", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;
    a.x()
TypeError: x() takes no arguments (1 given)
</code></pre>
<p>But that's simple enough to fix, methods expect a class instance to be passed to them! Let's just modify <strong>b.py</strong>...</p>
<p><strong>b.py</strong>, modified</p>
<pre><code>def x(self):
    print "Hi, I'm x!"


def y(self):
    print "Hi, I'm y!"
</code></pre>
<p>Executing this will print:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, I'm x!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember to try before you post - often the answer is as simple as "Yes, just do it!" :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Not with that signature.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>import b ; class A(): x = staticmethod(b.x)</code> like that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Seems like an XY Problem. What are you actually trying to accomplish?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you could create a class in b.py and inherit</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is it at all possible you are trying to import <code>random.shuffle</code> for a list subclass?  I describe why that specific case doesn't work in my <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36404588/python-how-to-monkey-patch-class-method-to-other-class-method/36405018#36405018">answer here</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">you may want to clarify "class methods expect a class instance" since <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>classmethod</code></a> is a real thing that has nothing to do with this case, maybe just say "methods expect an instance of the class"  (other then that; really good answer!)</span>
