<p>Here's my Python code which doesn't work. One list is called <code>sentencelist</code>the other is called <code>noduplicateslist</code>. For each word in <code>sentencelist</code>, I want to find that word's index in <code>noduplicateslist</code>.</p>
<p>For example, sentencelist may be THE CAT SAT ON THE MAT and noduplicateslist would be THE CAT SAT ON MAT. So I want it to return 1,2,3,4,1,5</p>
<p>I have tried:</p>
<pre><code>for word in sentencelist:
    for x in range(len(noduplicateslist)):
            position.append[x]
            print(position)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You most likely would benefit from reading about list.index(), as described <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>Example usage which produces your desired output:</p>
<pre><code>for word in sentencelist:
        print(noduplicateslist.index(word))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm a little confused: what do you expect <code>position.append[x]</code> to do? I'd use <code>if noduplicateslist[x] == word: print x</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">For example, sentencelist may be THE CAT SAT ON THE MAT and noduplicateslist would be THE CAT SAT ON MAT. So I want it to return 1,2,3,4,1,5</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should add that example to your question</span>
