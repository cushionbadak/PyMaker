<p>I was just checking out some docs on ABCs for a project of mine, where I need to do some type-related work. Those are the official docs about the ValuesView type, in both Python 2 and 3:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.ValuesView" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.ValuesView</a>
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html</a></p>
<p>and this is the source (Python 2, but same happens in Python 3)</p>
<p><a href="https://hg.python.org/releases/2.7.11/file/9213c70c67d2/Lib/_abcoll.py#l479" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://hg.python.org/releases/2.7.11/file/9213c70c67d2/Lib/_abcoll.py#l479</a></p>
<p>I was very puzzled about the ValuesView interface, because from a
logical standpoint it should inherit from Iterable, IMHO (it's even
got the __iter__ Mixin method); on the contrary the docs say that it just
inherits from MappingView, which inherits from Sized, which doesn't
inherit from Iterable.</p>
<p>So I fired up my 2.7 interpreter:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import Iterable
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {1:2, 3:4}
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(d.viewvalues(), Iterable) 
True
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It looks iterable, after all, because of Iterable's own subclasshook.</p>
<p>But I don't understand why ValuesView isn't explicitly Iterable. Other ABCs, like Sequence or Set, are explicitly Iterable. Is there some arcane reason behind that, or it's just a documentation+implementation shortcoming for a little-used feature?</p>
<p>EDIT:
ValuesView works as expected from Python 3.7 onwards. Seems no more than an oversight. </p>

<p>In Python 3.7.2, it inherits from both MappingView and <strong>Collection</strong> which in turn inherits from (among others) <strong>Iterable</strong>. Someone listened to you.</p>
