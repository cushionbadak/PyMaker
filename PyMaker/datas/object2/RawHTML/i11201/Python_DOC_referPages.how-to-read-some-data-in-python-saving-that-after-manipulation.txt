<p>Suppose I read a file a csv file as a nested list in python. 
data in python looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>my_data=[[1,4,6,2],
        [1,6,5,2],
        [1,2,1,6]]
</code></pre>
<p>and so on. </p>
<p>Suppose I have to do some cleaning with data in python( for several purpose). Data continues to look as a nested list in python. Now I want to take this data and export into a csv file so I can read them later without doing any cleaning process. Csv file would look like a classic excel file: for example first list</p>
<pre><code>[1,4,6,2]
</code></pre>
<p>should be first row of the csv file and so on.</p>
<p>In which way should I proceed?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you looked at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv</a> reader and writer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please provide info on if either a) the data written to file will be nested or b) flattened. In case of a) we would need more details on how the nesting will be after the processing to suggest a good storage strategy in case of b) proceed eg as @CoryKramer suggests.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try to rephrase it. hope it's clear enough</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can try using a string to replace a number, works fine.</span>
