<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a series of equal length strings of 24 characters like </p>
<pre><code>my_series = ['ThisIsASentenceXXXXXXXXX', 'SoIsThisXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', 'YouGetThePointXXXXXXXXXX']
</code></pre>
<p>And I have a list also with equal length strings of 4 characters like</p>
<pre><code>my_list = ['This', 'XXXX', 'GetT']
</code></pre>
<p>I want to compare each entry in my_list with each block of 4 characters in every entry in my_series and return the my_series items that the list string was found in. </p>
<p>For example for the string 'This' in my_list I would want my_series items 1 and 2 returned and for 'XXXX' my_series items 1,2,3 would be returned. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The following generator will create a 2 dimensional list. Each list will contain any matches, and it's position will match to the my_list index.</p>
<pre><code>n_list = [[x for x in my_series if item in x] for item in my_list]
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[['ThisIsASentenceXXXXXXXXX', 'SoIsThisXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'], ['ThisIsASentenceXXXXXXXXX', 'SoIsThisXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX', 'YouGetThePointXXXXXXXXXX'], ['YouGetThePointXXXXXXXXXX']]</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>therefore <code>n_list[0]</code> contains matches for <code>my_list[0]</code> etc...
I hope this helped you out!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to split each entries in the <code>my_series</code> into 6 chunks:</p>
<pre><code>serires_chunks = [(s[0:4], s[4:8], s[8:12], s[12:16], s[16:20], s[20:24])
                  for s in my_series]
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can iterate over this chunks to find the matching items:</p>
<pre><code>for item in my_list:
    for index, chunks in enumerate(serires_chunks):
        for place, chunk in enumerate(chunks, 1):
            if item == chunk:
                location = my_series[index]
                print("Found '{item}' in '{location}' at {place}".format(**locals()))
</code></pre>
<p>You'll obtain:</p>
<pre><code>Found 'This' in 'ThisIsASentenceXXXXXXXXX' at 1
Found 'This' in 'SoIsThisXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' at 2
Found 'XXXX' in 'ThisIsASentenceXXXXXXXXX' at 5
Found 'XXXX' in 'ThisIsASentenceXXXXXXXXX' at 6
Found 'XXXX' in 'SoIsThisXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' at 3
Found 'XXXX' in 'SoIsThisXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' at 4
Found 'XXXX' in 'SoIsThisXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' at 5
Found 'XXXX' in 'SoIsThisXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' at 6
Found 'XXXX' in 'YouGetThePointXXXXXXXXXX' at 5
Found 'XXXX' in 'YouGetThePointXXXXXXXXXX' at 6
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">not gonna help too much but something like if my_list[0] in my_series[0]:</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't believe this is the desired output the OP was looking for.</span>
