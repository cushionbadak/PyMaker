<p>I'm sure that this is a very elementary question, so thank you in advance for your patience. </p>
<p>I'm using a simple regular expression to identify whether a year is present in a line of text (line is a dictionary so I'm calling the particular field I want to search). Then I want to do something with the year. My question is, how can I return the year that my search finds? Everything I'm finding online tells me how to replace or edit it, but in this case the value is the thing I want to extract/use.</p>
<pre><code>p = re.compile('\d{4}')
if p.search(line['productionStartYear']):
    # do something with the value the regular expression found
else:
    # do something else
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You just need to put the matched object in a variable, then use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.match.group" rel="nofollow"><code>group()</code> attribute</a> in order to return the matched string.</p>
<pre><code>p = re.compile('\d{4}')
matched_obj = p.search(line['productionStartYear'])
if matched_obj:
    # do something with the value the regular expression found
    # print matched_obj.group(0)
else:
    # do something else
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>match.group([group1, ...])</strong></p>
<p>Returns one or more subgroups of the match. If there is a single argument, the result is a single string; if there are multiple arguments, the result is a tuple with one item per argument. Without arguments, group1 defaults to zero (the whole match is returned). If a groupN argument is zero, the corresponding return value is the entire matching string; if it is in the inclusive range [1..99], it is the string matching the corresponding parenthesized group.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>re.match()</code> and <code>re.group()</code>. <code>re.search()</code> might also be useful. <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_reg_expressions.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorialspoint.com/python/python_reg_expressions.htm</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That make sense, could you give an example or comment on the syntax? I'm getting this error: AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'group' when I try to do what you described. (Doesn't seem I can enter code as a comment)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's exactly what I needed. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TeganLohman you should tick the answer to accept it.</span>
