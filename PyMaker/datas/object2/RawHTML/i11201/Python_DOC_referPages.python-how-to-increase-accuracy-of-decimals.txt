<p>I'm writing a program where I need to pass in very accurate decimal representations of fractions (i.e. accurate to over 200 decimal places). However simply telling python to include more decimal places (using %.50f, for instance) often simply adds a bunch of 0s to the ends of certain decimals. </p>
<p>Is there a way to get python to display accurately an arbitrary number of  decimal places for a fraction? Do I need to install a package/module?</p>

<p>Python 2.7 and above can do the following,</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow">Decimal Library</a> from the python standard libraries by using <code>from decimal import *</code> and do this:</p>
<pre><code>from decimal import *
with localcontext() as context:
    context.prec = #your_precision_here
    print(Decimal(#calculation_here))
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Check the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow">decimal module</a>, which is included with Python. It can show the <em>exact</em> decimal representation of any value stored in a float or decimal variable.</p>
<p>This is not quite the same as showing arbitrarily many decimal places for a fraction, but see if it meets your needs.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">BigNumbers, BigDecimals, etc.? No idea what they are called in Python, but I am pretty sure Python has them. They allow you to define numbers with an almost inifinite amount of decimal places without losing precision.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Decimal I believe can do unlimited precision, because it does the same thing as the big numbers, so it can virtually have an unlimited precision</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you should change 'is context' to 'as context'.  I would edit it, but its too small an edit to be allowed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry yes corrected that was a mistake</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, <code>print(decimal(#calculation_here))</code> should be <code>print(Decimal(#calculation_here))</code>, capital D.</span>
