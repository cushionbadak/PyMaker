<p>I have a list with 11 elements and i need all possible tuples with a length of 4 out of it. So I found the function <code>combinations</code> in Itertools.</p>
<p>However, it delivers only 210 tuples instead of 11^4 = 14641. I checked with the <code>print</code> function and many of them are missing. </p>
<p>What can I do, or what is the problem?</p>
<pre><code>atom = [0, 5, 6, 12, 10, 13, 11, 9, 1, 2]
atoms = list(itertools.combinations(atom,4))
</code></pre>

<p><code>combinations</code> gives you tuples in sorted order, no repeats.  It sounds like you instead want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.product</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import product
atom = range(11)

print(len(list(product(atom, repeat=4))))
# 14641
</code></pre>

<p>Sure - you get all the combinations of your list (which contains 10 elements).
<code>combinations</code> returns all distinct unordered numbers in your list combined as 4 elements.</p>
<p>The number of possible combinations is 10 over 4 - this is (10*9*8*7 / 4*3*2*1) - which is exactly 210.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/discretemathematics/combinations.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Combinations Calculator</a></p>
<p><code>permuations</code> is maybe what you want - it returns all ordered combinations - e.g. it would yield [0 5 6 12], [5 0 6 12] whereas <code>combinations</code> would only yield [0 5 6 12] in that case. </p>
<p>But <code>permutations</code> is also not 11^4, but 10*9*8*7 elements. Correct would be 10^4 in your case maybe - and you have to use <code>product</code> if you <em>really</em> want something like [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,5], etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[1, 2, 3, 4] and [1, 3, 2, 4]</p>

<p>They only return different value sets. You can use permutation as follow</p>
<pre><code>list(itertools.permutations(atoms, 4))
</code></pre>
<p>if you want to get values like follow</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[1, 1, 1, 2] and [1, 1, 2, 1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to write <code>product</code> as @Patrick Haugh mentioned</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@Chris_Rands If you use a list that actually has 11 elements, you'll get 14641</span>
<span class="comment-copy">my mistake +1 (might be worth pointing out that their <code>atom</code> is length 10)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you. I was looking for permutations. Yeah it is only 10 element I misscounted</span>
