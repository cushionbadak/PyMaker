<p>How would I exactly go about offsetting the timestamp returned by <code>datetime.utcnow()</code> by any amount of time such as a day?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>now = datetime.utcnow().isoformat() + 'Z'
</code></pre>
<p>I need the above offset by a day. Having a minor issue when my script crosses into the daylight savings time conversion but I dont need to see past it however since it loads today also it dies because the python script errors doing work on the date today now.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To simply add a certain delta time onto UTC add a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">timedelta</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, timedelta

now = (datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=3)).isoformat() + 'Z'

print(now)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>2018-11-06T16:55:06.535804Z
</code></pre>

<p>More info on python with timezones can be found at  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19654578/python-utc-datetime-objects-iso-format-doesnt-include-z-zulu-or-zero-offset">Python UTC datetime object's ISO format doesn't include Z (Zulu or Zero offset)</a></p>
<p>With 3.7 <code>datetime.strptime</code> and <code>datetime.strftime</code> even recognize <code>01:30</code> as <code>%z</code> - up to 3.6 the colon would make it crash :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks much. I couldnt figure out how to pair the two. That works perfectly.</span>
