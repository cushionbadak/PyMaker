<p>i'm currently a computer engineering student and i have a couple of quick questions pertaining to a homework i'm not quite sure i understand.</p>
<p>The first one is "is python a proprietary language" I'm not sure if that's translated correctly so apologies in advance</p>
<p>The secon one is "is python free software" technicaly it's a programming language right? Does it count as software?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python is free software, and it's open source. Anyone can use it in a commercial or public project.</p>
<p>Python is not a proprietary language, for the same reasons.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">For your second question: Python is a language not a software, an implementation of Python like an interpreter is a software. There are many, they can have different licenses. The most common like CPython and Pypy are free software.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, Python is a <i>programming language</i>. The software is the interpreter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's the difference between a programming language and software?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is basically the same as the difference between English and a person speaking English.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A language is a set of rules and constraints that describe syntax and semantics. A interpreter is a software that reads a text file and tries to follow its contents based on a specific language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Gabriel I can see A) how they're conceptual, and I can see B) how all software is a subset of programming languages, but not how to infer from A+B that programming languages are not software. At any rate you've been exceedingly generous explaining A &amp; B to me and I'll spend some time wrapping my head around C on my own. Thank you!</span>
