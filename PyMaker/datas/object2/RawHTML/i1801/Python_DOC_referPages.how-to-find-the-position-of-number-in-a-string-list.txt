<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code> a = ['+321','+09e8','\sdf5234','6']
</code></pre>
<p>I want to convert it into a list of all numbers. In other words, remove all non-digit characters from all the strings from the list. The result should be a list of integers not strings.</p>
<pre><code>[321,98, 5234, 6]
</code></pre>
<p>Any help is much appreciated! Thanks</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>re.sub</code></p>
<pre><code>In [1]: import re

In [2]: a = ['+321','+09e8','\sdf5234','6']

In [3]: [int(re.sub('[^0-9]','',x)) for x in a]
Out[3]: [321, 98, 5234, 6]
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>re.sub('[^0-9]','',x)</code> will replace all the characters other than numbers(0-9) from the string. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Something simple and easy to understand like this will do the trick...</p>
<pre><code>a = ['+321','+09e8','\sdf5234','6']
b = []
c = ''

for item in a:
    for char in item:
        if char.isdigit():
             c += char
    b.append(int(c))
    c = ''

print(b)
</code></pre>
<p>It loops through every item in the list <code>a</code> and loops through each character of <code>a</code>. It checks if the character is a number and if so, adds it to the string to add to the output (<code>b</code>)</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Without regex, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.isdigit</code></a> with a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>a = ['+321','+09e8','\sdf5234','6']

res = [int(''.join([i for i in x if i.isdigit()])) for x in a]

[321, 98, 5234, 6]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">+09e8 is a representation of 9*10^8 (900,000,000). Do you want to keep it as that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no, e is the letter e</span>
