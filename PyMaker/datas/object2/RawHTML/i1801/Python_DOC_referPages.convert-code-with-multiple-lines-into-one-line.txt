<p>I want to put the following code in one single line:</p>
<pre><code>from sys import argv
script,from_file,to_file = argv
print(f"copying from {from_file} to {to_file}")
in_file = open(from_file)
indata = in_file.read()
input("move one == enter")
out_file = open.(to_file,'w')
out_file.write(indata)
out_file.close()
in_filen.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>I think it was with <code>;</code>, but I don't remember.</p>

<p>A simple statement is comprised within a single logical line. Several

<span class="comment-copy">What is exactly your problem? I don't understand your question...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well you could concatenate multiple statements in one line with semicolons but why would you want to make code terribly ugly?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But in general reducing the number of lines of code is not by itself a useful aim in python, if you want to stick with your current structure then use the <code>with</code> statement to handle opening and closing of files</span>
