<p>I have a Selenium Class with a  few methods:</p>
<pre><code>class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
    cls.USER = 'user'
    cls.PASSWORD = 'password'
    cls.browser = Chrome()
    cls.browser.get('http...')

    def test_1(self):
    .....

    def test_2(self):
    .....

    def test3(self):
    .....
</code></pre>
<p>As I add more methods, the one that is called first when I execute the entire <code>MyTest</code> class changes. Sometimes method <code>test3</code> will get called first, but if I add another method, maybe <code>test2</code> will be called first. How can I make sure <code>test_1</code> is always called first? </p>

<p>According to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> of unittest library : </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the order in which the various test cases will be run is
  determined by sorting the test function names with respect to the
  built-in ordering for strings</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you just need to define method names in alphabetical order to run them in order. Just change method name <code>test3()</code> to <code>test_3()</code>.</p>
