<p>I am trying to set up a function using input , Is this possible ?</p>
<pre><code>function = input('Please enter a function example')
def f(x): 
 return function 
print(f(2))
</code></pre>
<p>So if the function input is x**2 it should print the num 4 . I know this syntax is not right because functions is an alphanumeric object , but I need your help to understand how to make it right</p>

Assuming you mean the user can enter a function:</p>
<pre><code>f = input("Function of x: ")
x = float(input("x: "))
print(eval(f))
</code></pre>
<p>Then enter <code>x+2</code> for the first input, <code>2</code> for the second, and see the result becoming <code>4</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Function of x: x+2
x: 2
4
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>For making it more versatile, you may want to import everything from <code>math</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from math import *
f = input("Function of x: ")
x = float(input("x: "))
print(eval(f))
</code></pre>
<p>then you can input <code>cos(x)</code> for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>Function of x: cos(x)
x: 3.1415
-0.9999999957076562
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>eval</code> on untrusted user inputs is pure evil.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which is nothing better.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The OP wants to evaluate certain mathematical expressions, not arbitrary Python expressions. <code>eval</code> should not be considered a suitable solution just because the former is a tiny subset of the latter.</span>
