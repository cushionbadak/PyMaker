<p>Say I have a list [1,2,3,4,5,6], I split this into two lists A = [1,2,3] and B = [4,5,6]. How can I make a function that picks a value from either list so there is a 50% chance that it is the first item of list A and 50% chance that it is the first item from list B and so on for the rest of the numbers. </p>
<p>The first item in the new list will be the first item from one of the two half lists if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Then it appends the result onto a new list and reassembled.</p>
<p>E.g. first number of the new list being 1 or 4, second number being 2 or 5, third number being 3 or 6 and appending the left over numbers onto the end of the new list</p>
<p>sorry if I'm unclear this is for an assignment and it's a bit confusing.</p>

<p>You could do it like so:</p>
<pre><code>import random

lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
t = len(lst)//2
l1, l2 = lst[:t], lst[t:]

sel = [random.choice(x) for x in zip(l1, l2)]
</code></pre>
<p>which produces:</p>
<pre><code>[4, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>The part where you talk about a <em>shuffled</em> list I am not totally following. The created list <code>sel</code> can be randomly shuffled however, if that is what you mean by doing:</p>
<pre><code>random.shuffle(sel)  # don't assign it to sel. Works in-place!
</code></pre>
<p>For more info and options look at Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random</a> module.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Split your list into <code>[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry, basically this is meant to pick a value from either list so there is a 50% chance that it is the first item of list A and 50% chance that it is the first item from list B and so on. Then it appends the result onto a new list that is effectively 'shuffled'.</span>
