<p>I have a question, so I want to make an app that gives you a random name from an array after inserting your name, something like this:</p>
<p>Type your name: Nico
Name chosen for you is: John</p>
<p>So I made an array with some names, but I want to check if a name was already chosen for someone and if was then remove it from an array or just make it unable to roll from an array.
Do u know what I mean?
I don't want a situation when name from an array will be printed twice for two different typed names.</p>
<p>How to do it? I'm writing in python3</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>remove</code></a> that name from your list:</p>
<pre><code>aliases = ['John', 'Bob', 'Frank']
aliases.remove('John')
print(aliases) # ['Bob', 'Frank']
</code></pre>
<p>This is assuming you don't have duplicates in your list (in which case only the first matching element will be removed)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do as follows using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random.choice()</a> and list <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">remove()</a> methods:</p>
<pre><code>import random

names = ["Fred", "Marcy", "john"]
name = random.choice(names)
names.remove(name)
</code></pre>
