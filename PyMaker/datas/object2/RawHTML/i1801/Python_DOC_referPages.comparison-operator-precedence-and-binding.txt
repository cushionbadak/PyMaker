<p>Why the expression 1&gt;=2==5&lt;=4 results in False?</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> of python 3, the operators &gt;=,==,&lt;= have same precedence and left to right binding. As per the rule, the evaluation of the statement should be in the following manner (assuming True=1 and False=0):</p>
<pre><code>1&gt;=2==5&lt;=4
=&gt; False==5&lt;=4
=&gt; False&lt;=4
=&gt; True
</code></pre>
<p>I am unable to understand why this expression evaluated as False. I am new to python. Can anyone please help me with the understanding of this operators precedence?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As per the documentation, it's not exactly evaluated left to right. The <code>and</code>'s are implicit </p>
<p>It's false because at least one (the first) condition is false, causing a short circuit evaluation </p>
<pre><code>1&gt;=2 and 2==5 and 5&lt;=4
=&gt; False and (doesn't matter)
=&gt; False 
</code></pre>

<p>Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., </p>
<blockquote>
<p>x &lt; y &lt;= z is equivalent to x &lt; y and y &lt;= z.</p>
<p>1&gt;=2==5&lt;=4 can be written as</p>
<p><strong>1&gt;=2 and 2==5 and 5&lt;=4</strong></p>

<p>Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., <code>1 &gt;= 2 == 5 &lt;= 4</code>is equivalent to <code>1 &gt;= 2</code> and <code>2 == 5</code> and <code>5 &lt;= 4</code> except that <code>2</code> and <code>5</code> is evaluated only once (but in <code>1&gt;=2==5</code> case <code>5</code> is not evaluated at all when <code>1 &gt;= 2</code> is found to be false and same in case when <code>2==5&lt;=4</code>, <code>4</code> is not evaluated at all when <code>2 ==5</code> is fount to be false).<br/>
Note that <code>1 &gt;= 2 == 5 &lt;= 4</code> doesnâ€™t imply any kind of comparison between <code>1</code> and <code>4</code>, and also <code>2</code> and <code>4</code>.  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">They didn't say "left to right binding". They said "left-to-right <b><i>chaining</i></b> feature as described in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Comparisons</a> section"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please read the question. In the question, I have mentioned that the expression <b>results in False not True</b> and I am trying to get an explanation for that. I have shared my understanding in the code section not the actual result.</span>
