<p>Ive been working on this python assignment in school and was stucked at this particular question given to me. From the data given, I would want to find out the person with the most savings.</p>
<pre><code>data = {
'Brad':5000, 
'Greg':8000, 
'Sarah':9000000, 
'Kim':6500000, 
'George':24000, 
'Ben':1000
  }
</code></pre>
<p>My code:    </p>
<pre><code>most_savings = 0

for person, savings in data.items():
    if savings &gt; most_savings:
        most_savings = savings
        print(person,"has the most savings at",savings) 
</code></pre>
<p>printed output was:      </p>
<pre><code>Brad has the most savings at 5000
Sarah has the most savings at 9000000
</code></pre>
<p>desired output:</p>
<pre><code>Sarah has the most savings at 9000000
</code></pre>
<p>Im not getting my desired output. I would like to know where did i go wrong. Need some help here. Thanks</p>

<p>Dont print in a loop - you will print the "at this time" richest one.</p>
<pre><code>most_savings = 0
pers = None 

# process all data, remembers pers and most_savings    
for person, savings in data.items():
    if savings &gt; most_savings:
        most_savings = savings
        pers = person

 # print only the final result
 print(pers,"has the most savings at",most_savings)
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the built in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>max()</code></a> function and specify a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/890128/why-are-python-lambdas-useful">lambda - function</a> as keyfunction that evaluates the (key,<strong>value</strong>) part of the item into account when deciding whats max() ):</p>
<pre><code>person, savings  = max( data.items(), key = lambda x:x[1])
print(person,"has the most savings at",savings)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The question is, do you want to output something as soon as you find a person whose income is greater than that of <i>some</i> other person? Or do you want to output only when you're sure that person's income is <i>the biggest</i>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks Patrick for the swift help. Ive gotten the results that i want. But just for added knowledge, how can get the same result but this time round using <b>Def</b> and <b>return</b> function?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>def get_max_savings(savingdata): return  max( savingdata.items(), key = lambda x:x[1])</code> ? If you are unfamiliar with how functions works, read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> -you provide parameters to the functions, use those and return a result-if you return nothing the function returns <code>None</code> automatically (f.e. if your function just prints smth)</span>
