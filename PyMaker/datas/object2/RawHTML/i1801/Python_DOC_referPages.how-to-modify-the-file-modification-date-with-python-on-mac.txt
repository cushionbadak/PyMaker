<p>Title says it all. I am trying to modify the file modification dates of folders. <code>touch t- YYYYMMDDhhmm</code> command from terminal does it, but it also changes the file creation date, which I do not want to change. </p>
<p>Is there a solution to this problem?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.utime" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.utime</code></a> can be used to change the modification and/or access time of a file.</p>
<p>It accepts a descriptor or path-like object, and a tuple of times in either seconds or nanoseconds. These specify the latest access and modification times, respectively. For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('tmp', 'wt') as f: pass
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = os.stat('tmp')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(result.st_atime, result.st_mtime)
1541131715.0 1541131715.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; os.utime('tmp', (result.st_atime, result.st_mtime + 1.0))
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = os.stat('tmp')
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(result.st_atime, result.st_mtime)
1541131715.0 1541131716.0
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">If I run <code>touch test2</code> I get a new file with today as modified/created date (in Finder Get info), as expected.  Then running <code>touch -m -t 200001010000 test2</code> sets both the created and modified date to the year 2000, which is what you observed but seems like a bug. If I then run it again with new date <code>touch -m -t 222201010000 test2</code> it modifies ONLY the modification date, which is the expected behavior!  I think it is a bug on Apple's part.  Seems like an omission that the <code>touch</code> utility doesn't have an Created Date option by itself. Should file a bug report.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bnaecker That's exactly what I was looking for, thanks a lot!</span>
