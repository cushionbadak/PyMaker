<span class="comment-copy">Does it have something to do with the fact that I am using python version 3.7.1 but the folder doesnt direct to that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you are a beginner in Python you should start with something simpler: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <a href="https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/screenshot.html#the-screenshot-function" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> of pyautogui tell you how.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Once again look at the <a href="https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/screenshot.html#the-locate-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>. There are multiple locate functions. Unfortunately it means more work to define the file location and then in the end remove the image but the responsible PyScreeze library was written too simple regarding the temporary file handling.</span>
