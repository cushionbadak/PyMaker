<p>The docs for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations" rel="noreferrer"><code>itertools.combinations</code></a> state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order. So, if the input <em>iterable</em> is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced in sorted order.</p>
<p><strong>Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their value.</strong> So if the input elements are unique, there will be no repeat values in each combination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Emphasis mine]</p>
<p>What is the exact guarantee being made here? An empirical check shows that elements are always emitted as if by</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(iterable)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(iterable)):
        for k in range(j + 1, len(iterable)):
            ...
                yield iterable[i], iterable[j], iterable[k], ...
</code></pre>
<p>What is the meaning of "lexicographixal order" in this case? In particular, I believe that the emphasized sentence is crucial, but I am not 100% of what the connection is. I <em>think</em> it means that the lexicographixal order is applied to the indices of the elements regardless of value, but I'd love to have someone confirm that.</p>

<p>To translate these paragraphs from computer sciencese into English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combinations are emitted in lexicographic sort order. So, if the input iterable is sorted, the combination tuples will be produced in sorted order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Lexicographic" here is a mathematical term and does not mean <em>alphabetically</em>, but "in whatever order the lexicon defines".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>early 17th century: modern Latin, from Greek <em>lexikon (biblion)</em> ‘(book) of words’, from <em>lexis</em> ‘word’, from <em>legein</em> ‘speak’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "lexicon" here being your input. Put plainly, your input defines the order in which the output will be produced. If you want alphabetically sorted output, sort your input.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their value. So if the input elements are unique, there will be no repeat values in each combination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This just says that <code>combinations</code> will not look at or care about the actual values themselves, it just combines elements by their position. It won't deduplicate based on the values, it deduplicates combinations of positions. If you want unique combinations, deduplicate your input.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order</a> ;  tl;dr, if you start with "abc", you will be getting "ab", "ac, "bc", and not "ba", "bc", "ac", for example (which would be the output of 2-combinations of "bac"). tl;dr of tl;dr: your loops.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Amadan. I'm aware of what lexicographixal order is and what combinations outputs. I'm just perplexed by parsing those particular paragraphs properly. Perhaps I'm overthinking it...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Amadan my problem is specifically that it's not clear to me that the emphasized line has anything to do with the paragraph that precedes it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Amadan If we start with "cba", we get "cb", "ca", "ba". But "cba" isn't "lexicographically" ordered. So now what is the guarantee (will the combinations preserve the original ordering in the list)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@slider Lexicographic does not mean <i>alphabetically</i> here. It basically just means "in whatever order the input was supplied in"; the input here being the "lexicon" which defines the order.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice, way better put than I managed to.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"The "lexicon" here being your input." Was the missing link. It all makes sense now. Thanks.</span>
