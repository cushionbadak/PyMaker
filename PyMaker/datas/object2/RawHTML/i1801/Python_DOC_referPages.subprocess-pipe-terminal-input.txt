<p>I am trying to write a helper script to shorten some of my project commands.</p>
<p>The script looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess

def up():
  subprocess.call(['docker-compose', 'up'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
  up()
</code></pre>
<p>This works, however if I run <code>ctrl + c</code>, it will kill the script and not the subprocess. </p>
<p>Is there a way I can make the <code>subprocess</code> the priority for all terminal input until it exits?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I solved this as follows:</p>
<pre><code>def up():
  try:
    subprocess.call(['docker-compose', 'up'])
  except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print('\n')
</code></pre>
<p>It appears to do the job.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>os.system()</code> probably does that. This doesn't particularly look like a good use case for a Python script, but perhaps your real script has more features.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">You must catch <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code>, then. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tripleee appreciate the response. My goal is to use this as a helper script that is cross platform. Unfortunately I don't think there is a good x-platform alternative scripting language?</span>
