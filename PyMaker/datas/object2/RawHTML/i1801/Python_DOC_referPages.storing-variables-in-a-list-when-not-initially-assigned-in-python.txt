<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Good afternoon. 
I created an empty list that Is going to be filled by the user. I used an infinite loop to continuously ask the user for numbers that are supposed to be stored in the empty list I created(and breaks when the user specifies) but it doesnt store these numbers. </p>
<p>It only just stores the last input number. </p>
<p>I have spent a good while trying to figure this on my own but I can't. </p>
<p>I need help with this please!</p>
<pre><code>def graph(chi):
    for a in numbers:
        print(num, ". -›", "α" * num)

numbers = [" "]

while True:
    n = 0
    num = int(input("enter a number  "))
    numbers[n] = num
    n +=1
    if True:
        another = input("add another? (y/n) ")
    if another == "y":
        continue
    else:   
        break

#print(numbers)

graph(numbers)  
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here:</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    n = 0
    num = int(input("enter a number  "))
    numbers[n] = num
    n += 1
</code></pre>
<p>You are always assigning to <code>numbers[0]</code>, because you set <code>n</code> to zero at the top of your loop.</p>
<p>If you want to add an element to a list, you should be using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>append</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>numbers = []
while True:
    num = int(input("Enter a number:"))
    numbers.append(num)
    ...
</code></pre>
