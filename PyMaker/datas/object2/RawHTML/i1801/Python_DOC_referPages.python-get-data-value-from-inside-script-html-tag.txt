<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So I need to extract a variable from an html webpage If anyone could assist me.</p>
<p>Here is what webpage contains</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    var id = "5010"; 
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I pretty much just need to extract that value from a webpage in py.
If anyone could help would be nice, sorry if this is hard to understand i'm dumb.</p>

<p>You can do this using urllib and regular expression searching.</p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request
import re

url = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53111019/python-get-data-value-from-inside-script-html-tag"
response = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
html = response.read().decode('utf-8')

#print(html)
between_script_tags = re.search('&lt;script&gt;(.*)&lt;/script&gt;', html)

print(between_script_tags)
</code></pre>
<p>URlLib extracts the HTML from the page, and then 're.search()' is finding any text in the HTML between '' and ''</p>
<p>However this will only get you this in plain text. E.g. in your case it will return a string of "<code>var id = "5010";</code>"`</p>
<p>You could go further to split this:</p>
<pre><code>output = between_script_tags.split(“ ”)
</code></pre>
<p>This would make output a list of three things: ['var', 'id', '=', '"5010";']</p>
<p>From here this is quite simple to extract the data you want.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I find it easy to use the python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string split() function</a> to handle this sort of thing.</p>
<p>EDIT: big update to handle new requirements</p>
<p>Something simple like:</p>
<pre><code>html = """
&lt;script&gt;
    var id = \"5010\";
    var id2 = \"8888\";
    var idX = \"XoX\";
&lt;/script&gt;"""

varlist = {}
vars  = html.split("var ")[1:]  # get each var entry
for v in vars:
    name = v.split("=")[0].strip()  # first part is the var [name = "]
    value = v.split("\"")[1]        # second part is the value [ = "..."]
    varlist[name] = value           # store it for printing below

print("Varlist - " + str(varlist))

---------------------
OUTPUT: Varlist - {'id': '5010', 'id2': '8888', 'idX': 'XoX'}
</code></pre>
<p><code>split()</code> returns a list of strings, broken-apart around the part you search for.  The second parameter indicates the maximum number of splits.  So by splitting on a string, restricting it to one split, then taking the <code>[0]</code> or <code>[1]</code> element, it's possible to pick the input apart to get the data needed.</p>
<p>In the above, the first split is on <code>var</code>.  This gives a list, since the string is split wherever there was a <code>var</code>, so the first part of each of these entries is the var name (and we throw away the junk from the beginning).</p>
<p>Then the code loops for each of these splits, fetching the var name by splitting on <code>=</code>, getting the <code>[0]</code> side.  Next is the var value, which is always contained in quotes, so splitting on <code>"</code> should give a 3-item list, the <code>[1]</code> element being the value of the var.   These are added to a python dictionary just for the purposes of the example.</p>
<p>If your values aren't always in quotes, perhaps it could be split on the <code>;</code> instead, etc.  Any sort of guaranteed pattern can be used.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Forgot to mention but var id isnt the only thing inside the &lt;script&gt; there is a ocuple other variables so how could I only get var id?</span>
