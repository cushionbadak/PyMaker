<p>I am not well versed in python... my professor posted a piece of code that includes the following lines:</p>
<pre><code>def formatOptions(options):
    from string import joinfields, strip, split

    options = joinfields(map(strip, split(strip(options), '\n')), ':')
    return options
</code></pre>
<p>When I run this using idle 2.7, I do not get an error message.  But when I run it using python 3, I get an error message.  Is this a difference in the two versions, or do I have a problem with the python 3 build?  This is the error message:</p>
<pre><code> File "ml_exercise.py", line 46, in &lt;module&gt; 

    formatOptions(options))

  File "ml_exercise.py", line 28, in formatOptions


    from string import joinfields, strip, split

ImportError: cannot import name 'joinfields'

<p><code>string</code> functions where already mostly deprecated (in favor of the <code>str</code> class methods) in Python 1.6.0 (that is some 18 years ago). The idiomatic way to write this code is</p>
<pre><code>options = ':'.join(part.strip() for part in options.strip().splitlines())

<p><code>joinfields</code> removed from Python in version 3. Just use the string <code>join</code> function like:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you try comparing the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#deprecated-string-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 2</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 3</a> documentation? You should always read the docs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I looked to see if joinfields is a method in both versions.  I was not able to find anything that obviously stated that, but saw that joinfields was the same as string.join().  I tried changing the joinfields, strip and split to string.join, string.strip and string.split but that didn't work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CuriousGeorge119 those are now (well, since Python 1.6...) methods, not functions. cf my answer for the pythonic way to write your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That worked!!!  Thank you so much!!!  I VERY MUCH appreciate it!!!!!!!!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unsung hero indeed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That was an easy one actually (the hardest part was to find out which python version introduced string methods actually - I would have swear they already existed in 1.5.2, but well, my memory is not that accurate obviously) - but thanks anyway ;-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your answer!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CuriousGeorge119 You're welcome.</span>
