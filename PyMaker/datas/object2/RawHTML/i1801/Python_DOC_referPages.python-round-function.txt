<p>this is slightly unclear: I'm not certain if you would like to round a float in which case you would use:</p>
<pre><code>percent_2 = round(percent_1, 1)
</code></pre>
<p>if you would like to round and sort every element in an array:</p>
<pre><code>percent_1.sort()
for element in percent_1:
    percent_1[element] = round(percent_1[element], 1)

<span class="comment-copy">Is your <code>percent_1</code> a string, a numpy array, or a dataframe? where the <code>round</code> function is coming from?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Much would be made clear if you showed a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@anishtain <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round" rel="nofollow noreferrer">round</a> is a built-in function in Python.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JackTaylor Numpy also has round function, but there's not enough code to figure out where is it coming from</span>
