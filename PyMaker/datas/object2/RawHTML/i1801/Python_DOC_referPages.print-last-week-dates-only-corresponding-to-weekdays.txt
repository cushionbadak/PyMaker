<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have below code:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date
from datetime import timedelta
today = datetime.date.today() 

for i in range(0,7):
    print (today - timedelta(days=i))
2018-10-31
2018-10-30
2018-10-29
2018-10-28
2018-10-27
2018-10-26
2018-10-25
</code></pre>
<p>Want I want is just to print weekdays and excluding weekends. So, my desired result should be:</p>
<pre><code>2018-10-31
2018-10-30
2018-10-29
2018-10-26
2018-10-25
2018-10-24
2018-10-23
</code></pre>
<p>Where can I modify my code to achieve aimed results?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.weekday" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.date.weekday()</code></a>, which:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the day of the week as an integer, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>from datetime import date
from datetime import timedelta

today = date.today()

for i in range(7):
    d = today - timedelta(days=i)
    if d.weekday() &lt; 5:            # Here
        print(d)
</code></pre>
<p>Produces:</p>
<pre>
2018-10-31
2018-10-30
2018-10-29
2018-10-26
2018-10-25
</pre>
<p>This gives you the weekdays that fall in the last 7 days.  Or, if you want the previous 7 weekdays, consider:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date
from datetime import timedelta

today = date.today()

num_weekdays = 0
for i in range(10):
    d = today - timedelta(days=i)
    if d.weekday() &lt; 5:
        print(d)
        num_weekdays += 1

    if num_weekdays &gt;= 7:
        break
</code></pre>
<p>This version is basically the same, with the range stop changed from 7 to 10, and an added <code>num_weekdays</code> counter.  We increment the counter when we print a date, and once we hit 7, we break the loop (otherwise we may print 8 dates, depending on the day of the week of <code>today</code>).</p>
<p>Or, another way:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import date
from datetime import timedelta

today = date.today()

prev_days = [today - timedelta(days=i) for i in range(10)]  # Get 10 previous days
prev_days = [d for d in prev_days if d.weekday() &lt; 5]       # Filter out the weekends
for d in prev_days[:7]:                                     # Select the first 7
    print(d)
</code></pre>
<p>Similar idea, we create a list of 10 previous dates called <code>prev_days</code>.  We then filter that list down by filtering out weekend dates.  Then, in the for loop, we only loop over the first 7 elements of the filtered list, so that we print at most 7 dates.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@KhalilAlHooti I want to be printed 7 weekdays not just 5 weekdays.Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you are almost there but your output just lists 5 dates but what if I want to list 7 weekdays? Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MGB.py I edited something to that effect in.  It works but I'm not thrilled with it.  If you don't need it immediately, consider checking back in 10 minutes or so to see if I've edited the answer again to something cleaner.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks that was what I was looking for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would be thankful if you could explain some lines what they are doing. I am little confuse to understand the code. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MGB.py I added another version and some explanation about each</span>
