<p>In php we can create multidimensional arrays like </p>
<pre><code>$item = array(
 "spec" =&gt; array(
    "more" =&gt; "smth"
))     
</code></pre>
<p>And  iterate them through <code>foreach($item as $a =&gt; $b)</code></p>
<p>I'm wondering if I can do the same thing including the iterating process in python</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, you can use a dictionary (of dictionaries) like this (python 3):</p>
<pre><code>item = {"spec": {"more": "smth"}}

for key, value in item.items():
    print("The key was '" + key + "' and the value was:")
    print(value)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">It sounds like you want dictionaries. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries</a> You can iterate through them in a similar way (also explained in the link).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Whilst <code>dict.items()</code> will achieve the desired functionality, it's not the <i>pythonic</i> way to iterate over a <code>dict</code>. <code>dict.items()</code> returns a <i>copy</i> of the dictionary; what you'd actually want to use is <code>dict.iteritems()</code>; this returns an <i>iterator</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Adam Mitchell no, since Python 3 dict.items() has the same behaviour as the old dict.iteritems() in python 2. Thats' one of the reasons I stated that this example was for Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">With Python 3.6+, you can also use f-strings, e.g. <code>f'The key was {key} and the value was {value}'</code>.</span>
