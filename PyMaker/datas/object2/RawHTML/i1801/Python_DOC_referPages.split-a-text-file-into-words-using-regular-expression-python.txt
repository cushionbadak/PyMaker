<p>I. THE RIVER BANK</p>
<p>The Mole had been working very hard all the morning, spring-cleaning
  his little home. First with brooms, then with dusters; then on ladders
  and steps and chairs, with a brush and a pail of whitewash; till he
  had dust in his throat and eyes, and splashes of whitewash all over
  his black fur, and an aching back and weary arms. Spring was moving in
  the air above and in the earth below and around him, penetrating even
  his dark and lowly little house with its spirit of divine discontent
  and longing. It was small wonder, then, that he suddenly flung down
  his brush on the floor, said 'Bother!' and 'O blow!' and also 'Hang
  spring-cleaning!' and bolted out of the house without even waiting to
  put on his coat.**</p>

<p>What i have tried is :</p>
<pre><code>import re
RE = (("([a-z])n’t\b","\1not"),("\bma’a?m\b","madam"),("W([a-z])-([a-z])","\1\2"),("-+"," "))
W = open("abc.txt","r")
W = W.read()
