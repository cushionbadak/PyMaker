<p>I'm new to python, I study it by myself, and I just want to make sure I understand something about find() function...</p>
<p>If I want to find a specific string, it will find the first index of the first letter/number of the string or the the first time this strings?</p>
<p>for exaple, there's the next given string:
"I$want$moeny$and$food"</p>
<p>If I type find('$')
it will give me the first time '$' showed up in this string, which is 1.</p>
<p>However, if I want to find "$moeny", I will get the the number 6, means python serched where the full "$moeny" string is showed in the first time?</p>
<p>and If I type find('$mommy') it will give me an Error, and not index 1.
Am I right? Did I understand it clearly?
Thanks a lot :)</p>

<p>The best answer is to try it yourself and see what happens.
A good practice is to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4621255/how-do-i-run-a-python-program-in-the-command-prompt-in-windows-7">enter the CMD or shell</a> and type "python" and try various commands.</p>
