<p>I'm writing a game that should run on several platforms.  I need a good time accuracy on all platforms.</p>
<p>I am not interested in knowing the time of the day, what matters to me is the elapsed time between two calls.</p>
<p>After reading the docs, time.time appears better on Linux and time.clock better on Windows.
I thought of writing something like this:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import time
__all__ = ['hrtime']

platform = os.name
if platform == 'posix':
    hrtime = time.time
elif platform == 'nt':
    hrtime = time.clock
else:
    # 'os2', 'ce', 'java', 'riscos'
    raise ValueError("I have no idea what I'm doing.")
</code></pre>
<p>But what about the other platforms?  Does MacOS return {posix}?  What about cygwin, is that a Linux or a Windows?  What is 'ce'?  Should I even care about these platforms at all?</p>
<p>Another option could be to use the SDL time from pygame.  This seems to have a millisecond accuracy on every platform.  Since I'm using SDL for the rendering I don't mind using that.  However, I am working on network code now, and using the SDL time in my network code feels a bit strange.</p>
<p>Question: what would you rather use, and why?</p>

<p>Since you are using Pygame, you should use pygame's function for abstracting that:</p>
<p>just call <code>pygame.time.get_ticks()</code>- it will return the microseconds since the call to <code>pygame.init()</code></p>
<p>It is not that unusual to have programs other than multimedia oriented programs to call SDL functions from pygame for things like sound warnings or even keyboard reading - there should be no problem using that.</p>

<p>I have always used this and never ran into any problems:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
import time

if sys.platform == "win32":
    # on Windows, the best timer is time.clock()
    timerfunc = time.clock
else:
    # on most other platforms, the best timer is time.time()
    timerfunc = time.time
</code></pre>
<p>And even if you'd run into some problems on some other platform, it's always easy to adapt the code later.</p>
<p>I would suggest against using SDL for this, for the reason you mentioned, as well as that the increase in precision (if any) probably is not even noticeable. </p>

<p>For the best measure of elapsed time (since Python 3.3), use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.perf_counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time.perf_counter</code></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a performance counter, i.e. a clock with the highest available resolution to measure a short duration. It does include time elapsed during sleep and is system-wide. The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the results of consecutive calls is valid.</p>
