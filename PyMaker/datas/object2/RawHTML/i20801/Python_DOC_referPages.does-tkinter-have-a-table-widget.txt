<p>I'm learning Python, and I would like to use it to create a simple GUI application, and since <code>Tkinter</code> is already built-in (and very simple to use) I would like to use it to build my application.</p>
<p>I would like to make an app that will display a table that contains some data that I've loaded from my database.</p>
<p>I've searched for <code>table</code> but have not been able to find any examples and / or documentation regarding a <code>Tkinter table</code> component.</p>
<p>Does <code>Tkinter</code> have a built in <code>table</code> component? If not, what could I / should I use instead?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Tkinter doesn't have a built-in table widget. The closest you can use is a <code>Listbox</code> or a <code>Treeview</code> of the tkinter's sub package <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>ttk</code></a>.</p>
<p>However, you can use <a href="https://github.com/dossan/tktable" rel="noreferrer">tktable</a>, which is a wrapper around the <code>Tcl/Tk</code> <a href="http://wiki.tcl.tk/1877" rel="noreferrer"><code>TkTable</code></a> widget, written by <a href="https://github.com/gpolo" rel="noreferrer">Guilherme Polo</a>. <strong>Note</strong>: to use this wrapper library you need first to have installed the original Tk's <code>TkTable</code> library, otherwise you will get an "import error".</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use Tkinter's grid.</p>
<p>To create a simple excel-like table:</p>
<pre><code>from Tkinter import *

root = Tk()

height = 5
width = 5
for i in range(height): #Rows
    for j in range(width): #Columns
        b = Entry(root, text="")
        b.grid(row=i, column=j)

mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>You can grab the data by accessing the children of the grid and getting the values from there.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If the table is read-only and you're using a sufficiently modern version of Tkinter you can use the <a href="http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/tree.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ttk.Treeview</a> widget. </p>
<p>You can also pretty easily create a grid of <code>Entry</code> or <code>Label</code> widgets. See this answer for an example: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11049650/7432">https://stackoverflow.com/a/11049650/7432</a></p>

<p>You could use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tkintertable/" rel="noreferrer">tkintertable</a>. See <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tkintertable/wiki/Usage" rel="noreferrer">here</a> how to start using it.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/clarenceangel/tkinterstuff" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/clarenceangel/tkinterstuff</a> i made this but I am no pro. It does create a table though and return it as a frame that you can add to a frame or root.You feed it a csv with any number of rows and columns so long as the columns are even on each row of course.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think you forgot to add a <code>b.pack()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, you should never mix grid and pack.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if I create a table like this how will I reference the fields after creation? If I got it right you are saying I can reference stuff with the grid coordinates?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Steven: What does the "b" stand for? Is this a conventional name for <code>Entry</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">great example <a href="http://www.daniweb.com/software-development/python/threads/350266/creating-table-in-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">This now redirects to <a href="https://github.com/dmnfarrell/tkintertable" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/dmnfarrell/tkintertable</a> where it states it's <b>for Python 2 only</b></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Freewind: Even though <code>tkintertable</code> is written for Python 2, it appears to be pure Pythonâ€”so, since it's open source, updating it to work in Python 3 might not be too difficult.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if your using pandas, this one might be a good option: <a href="https://github.com/dmnfarrell/pandastable" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/dmnfarrell/pandastable</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does not work in 3.7.</span>
