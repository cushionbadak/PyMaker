<p>There are many topics in Stackoverflow on AutoSklearn errors.</p>
<p>but each error is different and each environment is different</p>
<p>I have windows 10 64-bit</p>
<p>I installed Anaconda3</p>
<p>When I try to follow these steps</p>
<p><a href="https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/installation.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/installation.html</a></p>
<p>Step 1 : </p>
<pre><code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/automl/auto-sklearn/master/requirements.txt | xargs -n 1 -L 1 pip install
</code></pre>
<p>I get this error</p>
<pre><code>'xargs' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>
<p>How to fix that?</p>
<p>When I try the 2nd step</p>
<pre><code>pip install auto-sklearn

ValueError: Detected unsupported operating system: win32. Please check the compability information of auto-sklearn: http://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/installation.html#windows-osx-compability
</code></pre>
<p>which i think it is due to the step 1 fail.</p>
<p>anyone can help me fixing this error?</p>

<p>AutoSklearn is built for unix systems only. If you see first line in System requirement <a href="https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/installation.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>, it is Linux operating system.</p>
<p>The reason is resource module is only available in linux system. Find details about it on <a href="https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/installation.html#windows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/stable/installation.html#windows</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Make sure you have anaconda 64-bit</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The line containing 'xargs' is for installation on a linux machine. A bit further down the page: "Therefore, it is not possible to run auto-sklearn on a Windows machine." So the moral of the story is (like always) as soon as you try do something actually interesting windows fails miserably ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AkshayNevrekar it is Anaconda 64 bit</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So VM is the only way??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@asmgx VM is a possibility, yet it would be highly inefficient to run auto-sklearn on VM</span>
