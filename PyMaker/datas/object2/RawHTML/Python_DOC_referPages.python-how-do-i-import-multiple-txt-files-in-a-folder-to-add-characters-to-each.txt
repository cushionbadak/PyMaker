<p>There are text files of various names in the folder 'a'. I want to read all of these text files and add the letter 'b' to each text file. What should I do?</p>
<pre><code>cwd = os.getcwd()
input_dir = os.path.join(cwd, "my .txt files dir")

sorts = sorted(glob(input_dir), key = lambda x:(len(x) , x))

for f in sorts :
    f = open(input_dir, 'a')

    f.write(data)
    f.close()

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Append data to file:<br/>
- first: get all file in folder <em>a</em>.<br/>
- second: find extension with <em>.txt</em>.<br/>
- third: open it and do something('append', or 'rewrite').  </p>
<p>Demo:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import os

# your .txt files dir
path = 'a'
# append data what you want
appendData = 'b'

fileNames = list(os.walk(path))[0][2]

fileNums = len(fileNames)

# your dst file extension
fileExt = '.txt'
# # Extract extension from filename
# fileExt = os.path.splitext(fileNames[0])[1]

for fileName in fileNames:
    if fileName.endswith(fileExt):
        fileFullPath = os.path.join(path, fileName)
        with open(fileFullPath, 'a') as f:
            f.write(appendData)

</code></pre>

<p>Like the others said, this is an easy question that could easily be find on google. Anyway here's how to do it:</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>from os import listdir
from os.path import isfile, isdir, join

files = [file for file in listdir("files") if isfile(join("files", file))]
        directories = [directory for directory in listdir("files") if isdir(join("files", directory))]

print(files)

for file_name in files:
    try:
        file = open("files/" + file_name, "a")
        file.write("b")
        file.close()
    except IOError as err:
        print("Could not open file because : ", err)
</code></pre>
<p>Replace "file" with the directory where your files are or the path to that directory like "directory0/directory1/directory_with_files"</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Avoid to open files with</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>f = open(input_dir, 'a')
f.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Instead</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>with open(input_dir, 'a') as inputFile:
    Do something
</code></pre>
<p>Also what you want is</p>
<pre class="lang-py prettyprint-override"><code>import os
import glob  # We will use this module to open only .txt files

path = 'your/path'

for filename in glob.glob(os.path.join(path, '*.txt'))
    with open(filename, 'a') as inputFile:
        inputFile.write('b')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried anything yet? Where exactly are you stuck?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Google, then write some code. If it doesn't work, post it on SO. Seriously, looping over the files in a folder and appending text to files are 2 topics that have been asked and answered ad nauseam. It shouldn't take longer than 3 minutes to find a solution on google.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">t's something I've tried. It's a mess,</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@donghyeunyang don't panic it's an easy problem. You need to open all .txt files in a folder and then append them the letter b</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much for helping me. It was a lot of help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">'With open(') I didn't know, but I'll take it into consideration. Thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AZDDKKS you are welcome</span>
