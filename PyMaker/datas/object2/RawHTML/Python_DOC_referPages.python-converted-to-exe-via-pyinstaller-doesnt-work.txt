<p>I convert a simple <code>print("Hello World")</code> code form Python to .exe with Pyinstaller (with the comand <code>pyinstaller -wF</code>) and apparently it creates the file properly. However, when I execute it, nothing happens.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Nothing happens because <code>print()</code> sends a message to standard output (your terminal), but an .exe has no terminal. You can try to implement a GUI to display this information (in a module like <code>tkinter</code>), or have your program do something else like open a program or file on your computer!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">My guess is that execution doesn't take long enough to see the window -- try adding a sleep and see what happens?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OP says they're executing it, I assumed that meant it was being run from powershell in which case it would print to stdout</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MoxieBall I assumed <code>executed</code> meant double clicked from a file manager...I personally wouldn't create an .exe if I was running it from command line, so I figured that OP would not either. Guess they would need to clarify more in their question if they wanted a better response</span>
