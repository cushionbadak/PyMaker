<p>I have in a list of points two different curves (y1, y2) and I want to find the area between the curves when:</p>
<ul>
<li>y1 &gt; y2 </li>
<li>y1 &lt; y2</li>
</ul>
<p>I have found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25439243/find-the-area-between-two-curves-plotted-in-matplotlib-fill-between-area">this post</a>, but it only calculates the sum of both areas.</p>
<p>If we plot what I want, I want separately the blue area and the red area.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>:
I noticed in hindsight, that this solution is not exact and there are probably cases where it doesn't work at all. As long as there is no other better answer I will leave this here.</p>
<p>You can use</p>
<pre><code>diff = y1 - y2 # calculate difference
posPart = np.maximum(diff, 0) # only keep positive part, set other values to zero
negPart = -np.minimum(diff, 0) # only keep negative part, set other values to zero
</code></pre>
<p>to seperate the blue from the red part. Then calculate their areas with <code>np.trapz</code>:</p>
<pre><code>posArea = np.trapz(posPart)
negArea = np.trapz(negPart)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you show us some code of what you tried?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I have plot it the areas and look very promising. Otherwise, the areas does not exactly match with the area of the post linked. Do you know why this could be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just noticed, that this solution only works as an approximation, so the values are not exactly right.</span>
