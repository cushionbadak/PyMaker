<p>I populate list2 with a while loop. However I encountered inconsistencies in the result. On printing the list, I find that it is empty.
On the contrary list1 has been perfectly populated using identical code</p>
<pre><code>k = 0

list1 = []
while k &lt; len(dark_color):

        list1.append(sum1)
        k = k+3
print(list1)
list1.sort()
myInt = 3
average1 = [x / myInt for x in list1]

light_color = [25, 163, 159, 139, 95, 95, 145, 13, 13]

<p>It is because you have not reset <code>k</code> to 0. Before your 2nd loop, you need to do a <code>k=0</code> or else it will start at a point where it is already greater than the array length.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Because you didn't reset <code>k</code> to 0 after the first loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print(k)</code> just before the second loop to see your problem.</span>
