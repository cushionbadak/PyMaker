<p>I am working on an RPG where I want to find the best approach to capturing user input and create a class instance based on their selection. I start by presenting a list of weapons and their attributes. I've done this with a dictionary.</p>
<pre><code> melee_weapons = {'Broad Sword': {'damage':30, 'cost':25}, 
'Great Sword': {'damage':40, 'cost':45}, 'Spear': {'damage':20, 'cost':15}}
</code></pre>
<p>I then have this simple weapon class.</p>
<pre><code>class Weapon:

    def __init__(self, name, damage, cost):
        self.name = name
        self.damage = damage
        self.cost = cost
</code></pre>
<p>Next, I have instances of all the weapons classes:</p>
<pre><code>broad_sword = Weapon('Board Sword', 30, 25) 
great_sword = Weapon('Great Sword', 40, 45)
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I have the function asking for input:</p>
<pre><code>def weapon_selection():
    print(weapons + ranged_weapons)
    wp = int(input('What weapon would you like to pick? Enter the corresponding number'))
    if wp == 1:
        Character.weapon = broad_sword
    elif wp == 2:
        Character.weapon = great_sword
</code></pre>
<p>There aren't any inherent problems with this method, however, if there is a faster or more intuitive approach, I would be very appreciative. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is no need for your dictionary</p>
<pre><code> melee_weapons = {'Broad Sword': {'damage':30, 'cost':25}, 
</code></pre>
<p>'Great Sword': {'damage':40, 'cost':45}, 'Spear': {'damage':20, 'cost':15}}</p>
<p>As you are manually supplying this information in the lines</p>
<pre><code>broad_sword = Weapon('Board Sword', 30, 25) 
great_sword = Weapon('Great Sword', 40, 45)
</code></pre>
<p>If you would like to implement a dictionary then why not create your class instances like:</p>
<pre><code>user_input = 'Great Sword' # or something similar
user_weapon = Weapon(weapon_list[user_input], weapon_list[user_input]['damage'], weapon_list[user_input]['cost'])
</code></pre>
<p>This way the user is supplying the key and you can automatically generate the weapon without having to create a weapon instance for every input to your dictionary by hand</p>
