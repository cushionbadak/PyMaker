<p>I am creating a leader board for my game in python and I want it to save it so that I can retrieve it next time I open up the game.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/43501005/1410394">@matusko</a> and @Christian Dean stated, what you are looking for is serialization, which Python has a built-in module for called pickle. Personally, since this seems like a simpler serialization usecase, I'd suggest going for cPickle, which does the same thing as pickle but is way faster because it's written in C. <a href="https://pymotw.com/2/pickle/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">See here</a> for a guide on how to use them for serializing different kinds of data.</p>

<p>My preferred solution for simple serialization is <code>yaml</code>.  It has the advantage of being human readable, but has the disadvantage of only being able to serialize simple data structures.  It looks like it would work fine in this case:</p>
<p><strong>Test Code:</strong></p>
<pre><code>leader_board = [
    [30, 'Player A'],
    [10, 'Player B'],
]

import yaml

# save the leader board
with open('LeaderBoard.yml', 'w') as f:
    f.write(yaml.dump(leader_board))

# read the leader board from yaml file
with open('LeaderBoard.yml', 'r') as f:
    read_leader_board = yaml.load(f.read())

# show yaml format and restored data
print(yaml.dump(leader_board))
print(read_leader_board )
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<pre><code>- [30, Player A]
- [10, Player B]

[[30, 'Player A'], [10, 'Player B']]
</code></pre>

<p>The simplest way would be using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pickle</a></p>

<p>Sounds like you are looking for a way to serialize your list so that it can be saved to a file and then read back in later. For serializing python objects, you can use the python module <code>pickle</code> (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reference page</a>). For info on writing and reading from files, check out <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You have two main options. You could store each element in your list in a custom format. Or you could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pickle</code></a> to serialize your list into a file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">BTW, we call them lists in python, not arrays.</span>
