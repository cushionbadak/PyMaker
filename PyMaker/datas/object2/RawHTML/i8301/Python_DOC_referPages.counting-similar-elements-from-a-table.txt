<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a table where the digits represents the something like a score where the alphabets are something like names. Example, in the first list, X scores 1 and Y scores 1.</p>
<pre><code>L = [['X','Y','1','1'],['C','A','1','2'],['X','Z','2','2']]
</code></pre>
<p>My aim is to find similar results between two teams. Example, X had a draw with Y in the first list and also X had a draw with Z in the third. That makes my output:</p>
<pre><code>X: 2 (because X has 2 games of draw)
Y: 1 (because Y has 1 game of draw)
C: 0
A: 0
Z: 1 (because Z has 1 game of draw)
</code></pre>
<p>Here's what I've tried:</p>
<pre><code>L = [['X','Y','1','1'],['C','A','1','2'],['X','Z','2','2']]
dct = {}

for i in L:

    dct[i[0]] = int(i[2])
    dct[i[1]] = int(i[3])

    if int(i[2]) == int(i[3]):
       dct[i[0]] += 0
       dct[i[1]] += 0
    else:
       dct[i[0]] = 0
       dct[i[1]] = 0

for i, occurences in dct.items():
    print(i, ':', occurrences)
</code></pre>
<p>It returned me:</p>
<pre><code>X:2
Y:1
C:0
A:0
Z:2 (wasn't supposed to be 2 but 1)
</code></pre>
<p>My mistake is probably at the 6th and 7th line or maybe my concept is wrong. Any help is much appreciated.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you begin to assign the number of draws with the score of the draw in </p>
<pre><code>dct[i[0]] = int(i[2])
dct[i[1]] = int(i[3])
</code></pre>
<p>you should probably initialize those with <code>0</code> - if the key <code>i[0]</code> (<code>i[1]</code>) is not in <code>dct</code> yet.</p>
<p>python offers a nice <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Counter class</a> for this kind of thing:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

score = Counter()

L = [['X','Y','1','1'],['C','A','1','2'],['X','Z','2','2']]

for lst in L:
    if lst[2] == lst[3]:
        score[lst[0]] += 1
        score[lst[1]] += 1

    # make sure we also have the zero scores
    else:
        if lst[0] not in score:
            score[lst[0]] = 0
        if lst[1] not in score:
            score[lst[1]] = 0

print(score) # Counter({'X': 2, 'Z': 1, 'Y': 1, 'A': 0, 'C': 0})
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>if you don't want to user <code>Counter</code> here is how you could fix your code:</p>
<pre><code>for i in L:

    if i[0] not in dct:
        dct[i[0]] = 0
    if i[1] not in dct:
        dct[i[1]] = 0

    if i[2] == i[3]:
        dct[i[0]] += 1
        dct[i[1]] += 1
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure I'm following the logic in the code. <code>dct</code> is going to be the total of the draws they had, right? For every 'game result' in the list, you're set the contents of <code>dct</code> to be their score, then if it's a draw adding <code>0</code> and if it's not a draw, setting it to <code>0</code>, so you're not counting the draws at all</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is your if/else condition inside the for loop or its the indentation problem during copy paste?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes counter worked well. But, i would like to not use counter for this since I haven't been using it much recently. I knew my problem was assigning the score in the early stage as you pointed out. Care to explain on how would i initialise with 0? I think that would help with the rest.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Maxxx: added an update that should fix your code.</span>
