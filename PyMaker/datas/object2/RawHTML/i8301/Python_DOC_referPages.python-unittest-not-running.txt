<p>I am trying to define a test method, currently I am not receiving any errors, but the test is not actually running. The test is trying to make sure that only the first word in a string that is in list_first_words is being returned. Any help would be great! </p>
<pre><code>import unittest

class TestSong(unittest.TestCase):
    def first_words_list(self):
        self.assertEqual(Song().firstwords(["hello world"]),["hello"]) 

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main() 
</code></pre>
<p>CODE THAT IS BEING TESTED: </p>
<pre><code>def firstwords(self,large_song_list): 
        all_first_words = [] # create an empty list 
        for track in large_song_list: 
            first_word = track.trackName.partition(' ')[0] 
            all_first_words.append(first_word)
        return all_first_words
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to rename the test method to  <code>test_first_words_list</code>.</p>
<p>Tests are discovered by unittest only when they start with the word <code>test</code>.  See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#organizing-test-code" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Organizing Test Code"</a> in the docs for more details.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As described in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doc</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A testcase is created by subclassing <code>unittest.TestCase</code>. The three individual tests are defined with methods whose names <strong>start with the letters <code>test</code></strong>. This naming convention informs the test runner about which methods represent tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, you need to rename the method starts with <code>test</code>.</p>
