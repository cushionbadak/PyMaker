<p>As you can see in my if statement I have multiple in conditions, how can I shorten it to only one?</p>
<p>I would like it be something like this for example:</p>
<pre><code>if (['5', 'Blue'] and ['10', 'Blue'] and ['60', 'Blue']) in clicked_items:
        print("2, 2a, 3, 4, 5, 5a components are dry.")
</code></pre>
<p>My current code:</p>
<pre><code>if ['5', 'Blue'] in clicked_items and ['10', 'Blue'] in clicked_items and ['60', 'Blue'] in clicked_items:
    print("2, 2a, 3, 4, 5, 5a components are dry.")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Sometimes multiple similar conditions can be collapsed into an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>all()</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any()</code></a> call.</p>
<p>This line does what you ask for:</p>
<pre><code>if all([n, 'Blue'] in clicked_items for n in ('5', '10', '60')):
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the above line used in a complete program. It prints "dry" in the first condition, and "nope" in the second.</p>
<pre><code>clicked_items = (
   ['1', 'Red'],
   ['5', 'Blue'],
   ['10', 'Blue'],
   ['60', 'Blue'],
   ['70', 'Blue'],
)
if all([n, 'Blue'] in clicked_items for n in ('5', '10', '60')):
    print("2, 2a, 3, 4, 5, 5a components are dry.")
else:
    print("Nope")

clicked_items = (
   ['1', 'Red'],
   ['5', 'Blue'],
   ['10', 'Red'],
   ['60', 'Blue'],
   ['70', 'Blue'],
)
if all([n, 'Blue'] in clicked_items for n in ('5', '10', '60')):
    print("2, 2a, 3, 4, 5, 5a components are dry.")
else:
    print("Nope")
</code></pre>
<h2>Update</h2>
<p>If not all of the colors were blue, then the generator expression might need to be different, like so:</p>
<pre><code>if all([n, color] in clicked_items
       for n, color in [['60', 'Pink'], ['10', 'Blue'], ['5', 'Red']]):
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What does <code>clicked_items</code> look like? Does your current code work?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Here is an example of wat clicked_items can contain = [['60', 'Blue'], ['10', 'Blue'], ['5', 'Blue']]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This works, thanks a lot! Is this called list comprehension btw?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, I did not use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#displays-for-lists-sets-and-dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">list comprehension</a> in this example. The <code>for</code> loop that is passed as an argument to <code>any</code> is called a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator-expressions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"generator expression."</a> The two have similar syntax.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What would you do if you needed to check if for example [['60', 'Pink'], ['10', 'Blue'], ['5', 'Red']] could you edit your answer to give an example please?</span>
