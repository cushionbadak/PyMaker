<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Can anybody help me write a loop that takes a list of data and checks if a value in the data is greater than the previous value and greater than the next value too. i.e. I am trying to find the peak data points in a set of peaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You may write a loop like this:</p>
<pre><code>lst = [1,5,3,2,4,1]

for i in range(1, len(lst)-1):
    if lst[i - 1] &lt; lst[i] and lst[i] &gt; lst[i + 1]:
        print(i, lst[i])
</code></pre>
