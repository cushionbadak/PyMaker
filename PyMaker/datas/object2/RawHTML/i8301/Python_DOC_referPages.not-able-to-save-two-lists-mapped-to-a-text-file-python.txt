<p>Currently, I am trying to save a list of numbers that I have been able to map to a different list. It works well when I print it :) - but when I try and save it to a text file I am getting an error.</p>
<p>This is the code when it works:</p>
<pre><code>print (*map(numbers.__getitem__, names), sep=",")
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I try and literally try and save the outcome above to a <code>txt</code> file I am getting an error:<code>invalid syntax</code> - not sure why.</p>
<p>This is the code for saving it to a <code>txt file</code>:</p>
<pre><code>file = open("contacts.txt","w")  
file.write(*map(numbers.__getitem__, names), sep=",")
file.close() 
</code></pre>
<p>Would really be happy if someone could help me here - I don't get how I am able to print to a terminal but not able to save that end result to a text file</p>
<p>@wim, I tried the following code below:</p>
<pre><code>with file.open("contacts.txt","w") as f: 
    print(*map(numbers.__getitem__, names), sep=",", file=f)
    file.close() 
</code></pre>
<p>it is saying that <code>file</code> is not declared! Doesn't work</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>print</code> accepts multiple arguments.  <code>file.write</code> does not.  </p>
<p>Try this instead:</p>
<pre><code>with open('contacts.txt', 'w') as f:
    print(*map(numbers.__getitem__, names), sep=",", file=f)
</code></pre>
<p>Or, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv</a> module.  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">What error are you getting <i>exactly</i>. I would expect a <code>TypeError</code> not a <code>SyntaxError</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That would produce a <code>TypeError</code>, not a <code>SyntaxError</code>, though</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, there is no syntax error in the code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, but the OP is reporting a <code>SyntaxError</code>, although clearly what you've stated stands.</span>
