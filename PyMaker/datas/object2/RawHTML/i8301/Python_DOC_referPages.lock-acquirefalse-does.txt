<p>I have a piece of code</p>
<pre><code>    locked = lock.acquire(False)
        if locked:  break
</code></pre>
<p>according to python doc:<br/>
<strong>lock.aquire(False):-
When invoked with the blocking argument set to False, do not block. If a call with blocking set to True would block, return False immediately; otherwise, set the lock to locked and return True.</strong>
I quite understand what they said but can somebody simplify this and please explain me in relation to the above code.</p>

<p>By default, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#threading.Lock.acquire" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lock.acquire</a> will block execution of the thread until the lock is released by a different thread. If you pass <code>block=False</code> to the function (as in your example), the call will not block, and will return immediately. Its return value specifies whether or not your thread has actually acquired the lock.</p>
