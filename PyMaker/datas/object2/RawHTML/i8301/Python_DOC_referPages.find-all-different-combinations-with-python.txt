<p>I want to create a function in python that as input takes a list with an unspecified amount of strings whose length is also not standard or the same with each other. The input would be like this:</p>
<pre><code>list = ['1234', '4', '97', ... , '542']
</code></pre>
<p>The first element of this list represents all the possible numbers that could be the first digit of a number, the second element the possible numbers that could be the second digit and so on. As output, I want to have a list with all the possible numbers that could be generated this way. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>input = ['12', '45', '865']
output = ['148', '146', '145', '158', '156', '155',
 '248', '246', '245', '258', '256', '255']
</code></pre>
<p>Is there an algorithm for this? I am not completely new to python but this problem has me at a loss. Thanks for any help.</p>
</div>

<pre><code>from itertools import product

input = ['12', '45', '865']

[''.join(prod) for prod in product(*input)]

# ['148', '146', '145', '158', '156', '155', '248', '246',

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itertools.product</a> takes  a number of iterables as parameters, and yields their cartesian product.<br/>
As your iterables (your strings) are in a list, we use the *input syntax to unpack the elements of the list to separate positional parameters.  </p>
