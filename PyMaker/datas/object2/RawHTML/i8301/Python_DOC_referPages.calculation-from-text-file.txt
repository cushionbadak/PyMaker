<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a text file containing:</p>
<pre><code>SKT:SSG:2:1
NJW:UIA:1:0
SKT:TRP:3:2
SSG:NJW:0:2
</code></pre>
<p>I want to calculate the number of wins by each team corresponding to the number in the text file. Example:</p>
<pre><code>SKT: 2
NJW: 2
UIA: 0
SSG: 0
</code></pre>
<p>Here's what i have so far:</p>
<pre><code>fileName = input("Enter the file name:")
match = open(fileName)
table = []

for line in match:
    contents = line.strip().split(':')
    table.append(contents)
dictionary = {}
for line in table:
    #how do i code the index of the team and it's score?
    .
    .
</code></pre>
<p>just a moment to test my understanding, if i were to calculate how many times each team wins, i have to ensure python is able to read that for example, <strong>SKT</strong> had a score of <strong>2</strong> against <strong>SSG</strong> of score <strong>1</strong> in game 1,which makes <strong>SKT the winner</strong>. Therefore, <strong>count + 1</strong></p>
<p>however, I'm confused on how would i place the index of the team name corresponding to it's score. Any help is appreciated. Regards.</p>

<p>you can create a dict to store all the team winning score.    </p>
<pre><code>res = {}
for line in match:
   team1,team2,score1,score2 = line.split(':')
   if team1 not in res: res[team1] = 0
   if team2 not in res: res[team2] = 0
   if int(score1) == int(score2):
      continue 
   else:
      winner = team1 if int(score1) &gt; int(score2) else team2
      res[winner] += 1
</code></pre>

<p>Using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.defaultdict</code></a> simplifies the procedure:</p>
<pre><code>import collections

scores = collections.defaultdict(int)
for line in table:
    teamA,teamB,scoreA,scoreB = line.split(':')
    # even if scores does not have the team key, += will create it
    scores[teamA] += int(scoreA)
    scores[teamB] += int(scoreB)

<span class="comment-copy">Do you need the table list? Your already iterating over the lines in the file</span>
<span class="comment-copy">build a dictionary of the teams, parse your file, determine the winner, add one score to the winning team in the dictionary</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try using pandas, though. It's more meant for this</span>
