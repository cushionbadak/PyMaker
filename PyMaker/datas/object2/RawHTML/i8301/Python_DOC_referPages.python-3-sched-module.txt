<p>I am trying to create a script that will run code at the top of every minute.  I'm looking into the sched module and I've encountered some strange problems.</p>
<p>The first problem is that importing sched runs my script twice.</p>
<pre><code>import sched
print('hello')
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Hello
Hello
</code></pre>
<p>Also this code which comes straight from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import sched, time
s = sched.scheduler(time.time, time.sleep)
</code></pre>
<p>produces this error:</p>
<pre><code>AttributeError: module 'sched' has no attribute 'scheduler'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As per my comment - your file is named <code>sched.py</code>, therefore, it was importing itself, of which doesn't have the attribute <code>scheduler</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have a file named <code>sched.py</code> by any chance. This works on both python2 and python3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tried both of your examples, and they worked fine on my end. Might want to make sure your environment is setup correctly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I had named the file sched.py.  It appears i was importing the file within itself.</span>
