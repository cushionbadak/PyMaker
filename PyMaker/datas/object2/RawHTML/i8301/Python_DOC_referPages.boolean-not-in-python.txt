<p>I leaned C of the last summer from K&amp;R book from 1989.  I am now learning python3. </p>
<p>I am a little confused about something.</p>
<p>In C if i do a test</p>
<p>if !(.....)   The '!' changes the value in the '( )' to the opposite, so if it was true, it becomes false and vis versa. </p>
<p>So what i was trying to do, is change this from C to python.</p>
<pre><code>int card(long long number, int size){
    if(!(size == 13 || size == 15 || size == 16)) { // test to see if valid size.
        printf("INVALID\n");
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>When i tried </p>
<pre><code>def card(number, size):
    if !(size == 13 or size == 15 or size == 16):
        print("INVALID")
        return 0
</code></pre>
<p>I got a syntax error. </p>
<p>So after searching on-line I found  "is not" in the python3 doc.</p>
<p>so i try it on the interactive terminal.</p>
<pre><code>   &gt;&gt;&gt; if is not (size == 13 or size == 15 or size == 16):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
    if is not (size == 13 or size == 15 or size == 16):
        ^
</code></pre>
<p>The interpreter was saying the 'is' is a syntax error. So i decided to remove it and see what happens. And it worked! </p>
<p>I searched on-line and i do not find the 'not' without the 'is'?</p>
<p>Is it OK to use 'if not ( ......)'  as the equivalent of 'if !(......)' in C? Or will i get into problems?  Or is there a different python way of doing this?</p>

<p>Sure. Try it. </p>
<hr/>
<p>However, I think you're missing the <code>in</code> keyword. </p>
<p>You can write this </p>
<pre><code>if(!(size == 13 || size == 15 || size == 16)) { 
</code></pre>
<p>As this </p>
<pre><code>if size not in {13, 15, 16}:
</code></pre>

<p>"is" means two variables point  the same object,the same Memory address

<span class="comment-copy">Just simply do <code>if not (...):</code>; In python <code>is</code> is the identity comparison operator (i.e. check whether the value assigned to a given variable is literally the same as the other).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also that <code>is not</code> is also an operator.  Related: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18275616/what-does-is-operator-do-in-python" title="what does is operator do in python">stackoverflow.com/questions/18275616/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Never thought of using a dictionary to do the comparison. In C there is no such class similar to a dictionary. If i used an array, it would only compare the first element, unless i used a "for loop" and index to test each one item, since an array is really just a pointer to the beginning of a continues block of memory, and using it name without an index, get you to index 0.  &lt;br/&gt;your example worked fine.&lt;br/&gt; if size not in {13, 15, 16}: &lt;br/&gt;I thought python dictionaries where value pairs such as:  dict = {'Name': 'Zara'}  Your answer did work, but it's not value pairs, can you explain that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's not a dictionary, it's a set</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can also use a list. <code>if size not in [13, 15, 16]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I thought { } meant dictionary.       [ ]  was a list        and   ( )  was a tuple</span>
