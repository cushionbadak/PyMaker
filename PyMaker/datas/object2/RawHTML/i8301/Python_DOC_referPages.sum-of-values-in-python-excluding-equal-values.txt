<p>Return the sum of 3 numbers, but if they're the same, they dont count towards the total. Can you help me find what's wrong in my code please?</p>
<pre><code>def lone_sum(a,b,c):
    t=0
    if a==b and a!=c:
        t=a+c
    elif a==c and a!=b:
        t=a+b
    elif b==a and b!=c:
        t=b+c
    elif b==c and b!=a:
        t=b+a
    elif c==a and c!=b:
        t=a+b
    elif c==b and c!=a:
        t=b+a
    elif a==b and b==c:
        t=a
    return t

<p>A simpler solution:</p>
<pre><code>def lone_sum(a, b, c):
    return sum({a, b, c})
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can achieve it within two lines of code by using <code>set</code> like this</p>
<pre><code>def lone_sum(a,b,c):
    return sum(set([a,b,c]))
</code></pre>
<p>This much more efficient than all the above codes. I suggested this because i believe programming is meant to solve problems efficiently.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with your code, I think you forgot to call the function. 
I also added some small features to your code.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">In general, you should show an example of when it's not giving you the right output. That being said, the solutions that have been provided are a big step up for clarity and efficiency.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The explanation for how this works is that the curley brackets <code>{}</code> are creating a set, which is "an unordered collection with no duplicate elements."  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets</a></span>
