<p>I am trying to execute post-failure operations; so I can gather info on the state of the system only if it fail.</p>
<p>So far, I did not find a solution that works. I did try to add a try-except and this works; but then the output of my test run is "success", which is totally wrong.</p>
<pre><code>try:
    self.assertFalse(x&gt;1, "the test failed")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    # do other post failure actions
</code></pre>
<p>Since the exception is caught, I assume that the unit test class won't be involved in reporting the error, and this end up with the test not failing.</p>
<p>How do I "escalate" the failure at the same time to both the except section and the Unit test class?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can <em>re-raise the exception</em> once you caught and recorded it:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    self.assertFalse(x&gt;1, "the test failed")
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
    # do other post failure actions

    raise
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you may and should <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14797375/should-i-always-specify-an-exception-type-in-except-statements">be more specific about the error you are catching</a> - in this case, you are looking for catching the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#AssertionError" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>AssertionError</code> exception</a> instead of the generic <code>Exception</code>.</p>
