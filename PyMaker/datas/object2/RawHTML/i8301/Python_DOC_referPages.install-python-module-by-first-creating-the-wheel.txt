<p>I just download files to build an API in python - a brief tuto on that API suggest that in order to install it a module, the following must be performed:</p>
<pre><code>* you can use this to build a wheel

python3 setup.py bdist_wheel

* you can use this to install the wheel

python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade dist/ibapi-9.73.1-py3-none-any.whl
</code></pre>
<p>This seems pretty straightforward, however I am completely unfamilar with that aspect of python and a bit at loss... I tried to run the command <code>python3 setup.py bdist_wheel</code> both in the folder containing the API and by first entering a python 3 environement (by typing <code>source activate python3</code> - i am using anaconda. Both return the error <code>setup.py cannot be found</code>.</p>
<p>Anyone knows where both command should be run in order to properly install the module?</p>

<p>You should write setup script for your module</p>
<p>Look <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>

<p>You can follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>cd  C:\TWS API\source\pythonclient</code></li>
<li><code>python setup.py bdist_wheel</code></li>
<li><code>cd C:\Python36\Scripts</code></li>
<li><code>python -m pip install --upgrade "C:\TWS API\source\pythonclient\dist\ibapi-9.73.2-py3-none-any.whl"</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Change python and API versions to the ones you are using. </p>
