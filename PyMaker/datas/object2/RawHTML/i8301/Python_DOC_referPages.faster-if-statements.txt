<p>I have a quick question about what would be faster to compute in python.
It's a large simulation, so any little thing to save time helps.</p>
<p>As I understand it, when python evaluates an "if" statement with an "or" in it, it doesn't bother with the second condition if the first condition is true. </p>
<p>Here I want check whether a randomly generated float between 0 and 1 is less than some exponential factor.</p>
<pre><code>if random() &lt; exp(a-b):
   do_things()
</code></pre>
<p>So would it be worth it in this case to make logically redundant "if" statements when the second condition implies the first, but the first might be faster to calculate? </p>
<pre><code>if a &gt; b or random() &lt; exp(a-b):
  do_things()
</code></pre>
<p>And would this be faster enough to even matter? Any input is appreciated, thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That means for (a and b and c), that b or c would not be tested anymore if a is false.</p>
<p>Similar, if you have an OR expression (a or b) and a is true, b is never evaluated.</p>
<p>So to sum up, the clauses don't fail faster with separation..</p>
<p>Don't worry about performance, worry about readability.... Thank you</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why not time it and see for yourself?  IPython has <code>%timeit</code> magic command and Python has <code>timeit</code> that you can use: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Instead of posting... why don't you just measure? (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html</a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"It's a large simulation, so any little thing to save time helps." Maybe it's time to consider not using Python for this section of code? Python is a great language, but if performance is your bottleneck you might need to change your method of computation to something else.</span>
