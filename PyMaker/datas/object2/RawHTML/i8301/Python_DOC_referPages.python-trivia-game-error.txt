<p>Trying to have a game where each question has a unique value associated to it. The player's score is then the total number of points of the questions she or he answers correctly. Been fiddling with it but I keep running into these errors :

</code></pre>
<p>not sure why it's having these errors/why its not running - suggestions? ty!</p>
<p>this is connected to a seperate .txt file named "trivia.txt" with all the questions and points.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Most likely the error is occurring because your text file contains unicode characters. You can add the <code>encoding</code> parameter to the <code>open</code> call to tell python that it isn't in the default <code>ascii</code> encoding.</p>
<pre><code>the_file = open(file_name, mode, encoding='utf-8')
</code></pre>
<p>If this doesn't work, it may be because the file is using a different encoding such as 'iso-8859-15'.</p>
<p>The Python documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Unicode-HOWTO</a> has more details about dealing with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#reading-and-writing-unicode-data" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Reading and Writing Unicode Data</a>.</p>
