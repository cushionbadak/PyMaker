<p>According to Python 3 documentation, python and pythonw should be equivalent for running GUI scripts <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html#running-scripts-with-a-gui" rel="nofollow noreferrer">as of 3.6</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>With older versions of Python, there is one Mac OS X quirk that you need to be aware of: programs that talk to the Aqua window manager (in other words, anything that has a GUI) need to be run in a special way. Use pythonw instead of python to start such scripts.</p>
<p>With Python 3.6, you can use either python or pythonw.</p>

<p>However, I just installed Anaconda with Python 3.6, and I still get the non-framework-build error if I try to run my wxPython GUI using python instead of pythonw:</p>
<pre><code>This program needs access to the screen. Please run with a
Framework build of python, and only when you are logged in
on the main display of your Mac.
</code></pre>
<p>What is going on here?  Why does this error persist?  </p>
<p>The version of Python I am using is:</p>
<pre><code>Python 3.6.0 :: Anaconda 4.3.1 (x86_64)
</code></pre>

<p>In short, use command</p>
<pre><code>conda install python.app
</code></pre>
<p>and pythonw will be installed. </p>

<p>I believe you can also just run your python script using <code>pythonw</code> instead of <code>python</code>. You'll need to use <code>pythonw</code> for GUI related programs.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>python --version</code> says?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have this same issue. My <code>python --version</code> says <code>Python 3.6.0 :: Anaconda 4.3.1 (x86_64)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">My issue is not that pythonw is missing.  It is that this: <code>With Python 3.6, you can use either python or pythonw.</code>  appears not to be true.  It would be helpful for me, for cross-platform reasons, not to have to mess with pythonw at all.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have the same issue. How do we tell <code>conda</code> to use <code>pythonw</code> after having installed <code>python.app</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I wish, as does J. Jones, that pythonw was not needed. But Anaconda has their reasons, no doubt. I am not sure what you mean by wanting conda to use pythonw. If you want to run a script with the framework version of Python, you can start it by in a terminal window by typing "pythonw script.py" rather than "python script.py". You can tell other applications such as spyder to use pythonw rather than python. Perhaps a starting a new question linked here would make what you want to do more clear.</span>
