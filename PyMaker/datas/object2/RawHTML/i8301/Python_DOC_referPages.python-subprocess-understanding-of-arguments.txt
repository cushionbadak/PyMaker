<p>I am currently re-working a file that uses the Subprocess module of python.
The lines starting the proccesses are the following:</p>
<pre><code>cmd = ["/usr/bin/time", '-f', '%e %M %P', '-o', time_file, script] 
p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre>
<p>In the first line the <code>time_file</code> and <code>script</code> are a file to temporarily store runtime infos (such as used ram, cpu, etc.) and the script to run, repectively.</p>
<p>But I don't understand the first arguments in the list (<code>"/usr/bin/time", '-f', '%e %M %P', '-o'</code>). </p>
<p>Anyone can help me decipher, or point me to a piece of doc that can help me understand what are those arguments, and how to create my own list of arguments?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The first argument <code>/usr/bin/time</code> is the name of the program which is run in the subprocess, and the subsequent elements in the <code>cmd</code> list are the arguments for that program. You can learn more about its usage by typing <code>man time</code> in your shell, or by visiting the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/time" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>You can also learn more about the Popen object and the subprocess module <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
