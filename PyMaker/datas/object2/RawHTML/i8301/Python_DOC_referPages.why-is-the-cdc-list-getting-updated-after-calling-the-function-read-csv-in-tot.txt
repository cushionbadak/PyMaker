<p>I don't think the code you pasted explains the issue you've had, at least it's not anywhere I can determine. Seems like there's a lot of code you did not include in what you pasted above, that might be responsible.</p>
<p>However, if all you want to do is merge two csvs (assuming they both have the same columns), you can use <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pandas</a>' <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read_csv</a> and Pandas DataFrame methods <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.append.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">append</a> and <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">to_csv</a>, to achieve this with 3 lines of code (not including imports):</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd

# Read CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame object
df = pd.read_csv("first.csv")

# Read and append the 2nd CSV file to the same DataFrame object
df = df.append( pd.read_csv("second.csv") )

# Write merged DataFrame object (with both CSV's data) to file
df.to_csv("merged.csv")

<span class="comment-copy">Not sure, but why aren't you using the built in CSV library (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html</a>), or something even better like Pandas (<a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/â€¦</a>) for data manipulation?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have just started with python from DataQuest and got stuck with this code. Anyways...Thanks for your suggestion.</span>
