<p>I am new to python and I am finding it really difficult to understand the whole concept of logging in Python. I am currently working on this web-scraping project using python 3. I have used BeautifulSoup4 to help me:
The code I've written below:</p>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup 
import urllib3 
import urllib.request

web = "https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html"

page = urllib.request.urlopen(web) 
soup = BeautifulSoup(page) 

print(soup.prettify()) 
</code></pre>
<p>Do you know how should I start? Where do I begin and what code am I supposed to write in order to create my log file? I am really confused, somebody please helpppppp me!!!!!!!
thank you!!</p>

<p>If you're dead-set on building a web scraper yourself okay, but take a look at <a href="https://scrapy.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://scrapy.org/</a> which handles almost all the nasty bits of dealing with requests, retries, crawling sites in general, etc.</p>
<p>Logging in scrapy is handled by the built in <code>logging</code> module in python. <a href="https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/logging.html</a></p>
<p>If you do want to build it yourself, instead of using <code>print()</code> use the <code>logging</code> module directly. Docs at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html</a> and a handy collection of cookbook examples is at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-cookbook" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-cookbook</a></p>

<p>The cookbook gives you lots of great information. There are many choices, but the minimum is very easy. I've updated your code with a basic log implementation. Run your code then look at <code>my_logfile.txt</code> in your current working directory. You can fancify by implementing the examples in the cookbook.</p>
<pre><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup 
import urllib3 
import urllib.request
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, filename='my_logfile.txt')
logger = logging.getLogger('scraper')

web = "https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html"

page = urllib.request.urlopen(web) 
soup = BeautifulSoup(page) 

logger.info('loaded {}'.format(web))

print(soup.prettify()) 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you need a log file? The most basic thing to do is to open a new file and write to it whenever something important happens in the code. Just search for "Write to file python"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CamJohnson26 Hi, thanks for the suggestion!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you want to log? Just the url? The page that was downloaded?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey Paul! Thank you so much!!!</span>
