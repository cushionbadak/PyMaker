<p>I don't know how to explain better, but I'm having the flollowing problem: </p>
<p>I create an symbolic equation, put into <code>sympy</code> solve and it shows me this answer:</p>
<pre><code>[{p1: 0, q0: -sqrt(3)*I/3}, {p1: 0, q0: sqrt(3)*I/3}, {p1: 0, q1: 0}]
</code></pre>
<p>The question is: I used <code>lambdify</code> and <code>subs</code> to try to put these numbers into my original equation. Is there anyway for me separate these sets and use it into my labdify or subs?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I used this:</p>
<pre><code>nrg=[eq.subs(i) for i in cr]
</code></pre>
<p>and I solved my problem :)</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">If this is solved then either post the solution or delete the question</span>
