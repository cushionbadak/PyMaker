<p>It seems that a leading 0 in a number causes error in dataframes. Can anybody replicate?</p>

<p>A leading zero causes a number to be interpreted as octal. <code>9</code> is not a valid octal digit, hence the error.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integer-literals">in Python 3, octal literals (numbers with leading 0s) are flat-out disallowed</a> to avoid confusion with bases and such. Instead, <code>0o</code> must be used instead for octal literals.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">umm not sure this is relevant, but leading zero typically means it's an octal literal.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually IIRC python does not support octals, to avoid this kind of errors.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A leading zero causes a number to be interpreted as octal for <code>2.x</code>, For <code>3.x</code>, its just a error.. right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AerofoilKite Yes, that is correct.</span>
