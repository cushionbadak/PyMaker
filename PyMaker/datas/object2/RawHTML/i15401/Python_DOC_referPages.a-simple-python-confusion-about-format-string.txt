<p>New to python and I am learning this tutorial:
<a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex8.html" rel="nofollow">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex8.html</a></p>
<p>I just cannot see why the line "But it didn't sing." got printed out with double-quote and all the others got printed with single quote.. Cannot see any difference from the code...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The quotes depends on the string: if there are no quotes, it will use simple quotes:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; """no quotes"""
'no quotes'
</code></pre>
<p>if there is a single quote, it will use double quotes:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; """single quote:'"""
"single quote:'"
</code></pre>
<p>if there is a double quote, it will use single quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"""double quote:" """
          'double quote:" '</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>if there are both, it will use single quotes, hence escaping the single one:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; """mix quotes:'" """
'mix quotes:\'" '
&gt;&gt;&gt; """mix quotes:"' """
'mix quotes:"\' '
&gt;&gt;&gt; '''mix quotes:"' '''
'mix quotes:"\' '
</code></pre>
<p>There won't be a difference though when you print the string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print '''mix quotes:"' '''
mix quotes:"'
</code></pre>
<p>the surroundings quotes are for the representation of the strings:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print str('''mix quotes:"' ''')
mix quotes:"'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print repr('''mix quotes:"' ''')
'mix quotes:"\' '
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The representation of a value should be equivalent to the Python code required to generate it. Since the string "But it didn't sing." contains a single quote, using single quotes to delimit it would create invalid code. Therefore double quotes are used instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python has several rules for outputting the <code>repr</code> of strings.</p>
<p>Normally, it uses <code>'</code> to surround them, except if there are <code>'</code>s within it - then it uses <code>"</code> for removing the need of quoting.</p>
<p>If a string contains both <code>'</code> and '"<code>characters, it uses</code>'<code>s and quotes the</code>"`.</p>
<p>As there can be several valid and equivalent representations of a string, these rues might change from version to version.</p>
<p>BTW, in the site you linked to the answer is given as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Why does <code>%r</code> sometimes print things with single-quotes when I wrote them with double-quotes?</p>
<p>A: Python is going to print the strings in the most efficient way it can, not replicate exactly the way you wrote them. This is perfectly fine since <code>%r</code> is used for debugging and inspection, so it's not necessary that it be pretty.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for such detail answer, also thanks to other people who replied</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"using single quotes to delimit it would create invalid code" is a bit misleading. Of course, escaping would be necessary then, and using <code>"</code> removes the need for escaping and makes things more readable.</span>
