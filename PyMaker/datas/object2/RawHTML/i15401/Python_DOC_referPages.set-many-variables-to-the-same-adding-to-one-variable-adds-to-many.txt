<p>I wanted to efficiently set a bunch of variables to an empty list. However, using this method, operations on one variable seem to apply to all:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r7,r8=[[]]*8
&gt;&gt;&gt; r1
[]
&gt;&gt;&gt; r1+=[2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; r1,r2
([2], [2])
</code></pre>
<p>Why is this? Also, what is the most efficient method that leaves each variable independent?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Doing <code>[[]]*8</code> creates a list of eight references to the same list object.  That is why they all get affected when you update one.  To make eight unique lists, use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#grammar-token-generator_expression" rel="nofollow">generator expression</a>:</p>
<pre><code>r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r7,r8 = ([] for _ in range(8))
</code></pre>
<p>You might also use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a>:</p>
<pre><code>r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,r7,r8 = [[] for _ in range(8)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why not just have a list of lists? As opposed to 8 variables? Or even a dictionary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ffisegydd interesting. Question about what you linked: If the syntax [x]*4 creates a 4 item list whose contents all reference the same object, why doesn't [[x]*4]*2 do the same, but with 8 objects total? Why was only the first element of each inner list changed?</span>
