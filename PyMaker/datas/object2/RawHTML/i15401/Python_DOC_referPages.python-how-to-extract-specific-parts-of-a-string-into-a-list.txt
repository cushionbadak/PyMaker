<p>I have string in Python from which I want to extract some information. It almost has the format of a list as you can see.</p>
<p>Is there an easy way to convert this into a list? As you can tell I am new to Python and regular expressions</p>
<p>I am after the data in "values" (3 arrays)
and the corresponding labels</p>

<p>This is javascript, so best try with json decoding.
When this is the only text you want to decode or you always have only once the text <code>"values":</code> 
, you can use</p>
<pre><code>import json
mark = '"values":'
lists = json.JSONDecoder().raw_decode(text, text.index(mark)+len(mark))[0]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>something like</p>
<pre><code>ast.literal_eval(re.search("data:(.*)",text_content).groups()[0])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can't really do more than point you at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json</code></a> until you provide more context/code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This works. Thanks so much. And apologies to the other posters for posting a screenshot. I couldnt get this to post as code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you cannot use <code>literal_eval</code> with a <code>SRE_Match</code> instance</span>
<span class="comment-copy">whoops fixed now</span>
