<p>I am making a pygame game and I want it to recharge the cannon (its a ship warfare game) fire recharge number.</p>
<p>I have the recharge set to 1.75 seconds (1750 in pygame time) and I figured out 5.714285714285714 is the number you must multiply 1750 by to get 10,000. By getting 10,000 I want to cap it so it only says the first 2 numbers. Like instead of saying:</p>
<p>148833 it will say 14.</p>
<p>Code for the variable change:</p>
<pre><code>if pygame.time.get_ticks() - starttime &gt;= 1750:
    count = "Fire!"
if pygame.time.get_ticks() - starttime &lt; 1750:
    count = (pygame.time.get_ticks() - starttime) * 5.714285714285714
</code></pre>
<p>If there isn't a way to cap an integer, I'll keep divided by 1000 to make it a smaller number.</p>

<p>Function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str" rel="nofollow">str()</a> returns a string from integer, and first two digits is [0:2]. Let me know if I misunderstood your question.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; count = 148833
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(str(count)[0:2])
14
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you clarify what you mean by 'says the first 2 numbers'?  You mean 'print out the first two digits of the number'?  Or 'set a variable to contain the first two digits of the number'?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should use <code>else:</code> to replace your second <code>if</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, what is it that you are trying to 'cap'?  <code>pygame.time.get_ticks() - starttime)</code>?  And when you say 'cap', do you mean that you will always show only the first 2 digits, or you will show the actual number if the number was &lt; 10000, and only show the first 2 digits if the number was &gt;= 10000?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@iForests fixed the "else" and "if"... and my questioned was answered Zehnpaard, but I meant first two digits printed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, thanks! I actually learned this before, but forgot it!</span>
