<p>I am trying to compare elements of a list <code>u</code> for equality.</p>
<p>A possible solution could be <code>all(x == u[0] for x in u[1:])</code>, or simply <code>all(x == u[0] for x in u)</code>, but it looks rather weird.</p>
<p>In Python, it's possible to write <code>a == b == c</code>, with its usual "mathematical" meaning. So I thought I could, with the help of the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html" rel="nofollow">operator</a> module, write <code>operator.eq(*u)</code>. However, the <code>eq</code> function takes only two arguments. Of course, <code>functools.reduce(operator.eq, u)</code> is of no use here, since after the first test <code>eq(u[0], u[1])</code>, I get a boolean, and it will fail when doing the second test, <code>eq(&lt;bool&gt;, u[2])</code>.</p>
<p>Is there a better way than the solution above? A more... "pythonic" way?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>len(set(u)) == 1</code> is pretty Pythonic.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If they’re hashable, you can use <code>len(set(u)) == 1</code>, but that’s just shorter, not better. <code>all</code> seems straightforward to me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Argh, I didn't see the duplicate. Thanks @jamylak to have pointed this out.</span>
