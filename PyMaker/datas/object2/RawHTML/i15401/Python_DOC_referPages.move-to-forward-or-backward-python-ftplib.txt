<p>I am intended to create a GUI FTP application by using Python and PyGTK.
So I have chosen ftplib. </p>
<p>Requirement is I want to create two buttons. Butoon 1 Forward and Button 2 Backward. When I click backward then it have to move to last directory. If I assume my object and function as</p>
<p>ftp.cwd() then What I have to pass as an argument  i.e ftp.cwd(something that send to backward). </p>
<p>Help me Please.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><code>.cwd()</code> is the correct method to change the remote (on ftp server) directory.</p>

<p>To implement forward/backward buttons, you need a list of previously visited directories. You could use <code>collections.deque()</code> that has <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque.rotate" rel="nofollow"><code>.rotate()</code> method that allows to move forwards and backwards in the history list.</a></p>
<p>You could use <code>maxlen</code> parameter to limit the history size. <code>.append()</code> adds a new item to the history. Each item may be a simple string representing the remote path. You can pass these strings to <code>.cwd()</code> method to change the directory.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">so you mean no need to deal with cwd() ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Raja: what do you mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think I understand . I have to pass your answer as argument to cwd right ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Raja: yes, <code>cwd()</code> accepts <code>pathname</code> a string.</span>
