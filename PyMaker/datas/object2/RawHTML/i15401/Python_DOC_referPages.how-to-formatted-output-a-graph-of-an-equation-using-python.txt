<p>I am a beginner so I don't think I need to use anything complicated.
Basically I have to <code>print y=x^+3</code> for the range<code>x=0</code> to <code>x=4</code> using formatted output and I don't know how.</p>
<p>From what I have learned so far, I'm supposed to use formatted output, looping and variable width output to do this.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to do it? Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Check out the module matplotlib, it was made to give plotting visuals in python. I hope this helps a little.</p>

<p>may be i just have to print the line, is there any way to do this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>for x in range(3, 7):
    y = x + 2
    print "With x equal to {},  y = {}".format(x, y)

--output:--
With x equal to 3,  y = 5
With x equal to 4,  y = 6
With x equal to 5,  y = 7
With x equal to 6,  y = 8
</code></pre>
<p>The arguments to the format() method are substituted in place of the '{}' sequences, in order, from left to right.  You can also specify the order yourself:</p>
<pre><code>                                       +---+-----------------+
for x in range(3, 7):                  |   |                 |
    y = x + 2                          V   V                 |
    print "Here are some numbers: {0} {1} {1} {0}".format(x, y)
                                   ^           ^          | 
                                   |           |          |  
                                   +-----------+----------+  
--output:--
Here are some numbers: 3 5 5 3
Here are some numbers: 4 6 6 4
Here are some numbers: 5 7 7 5
Here are some numbers: 6 8 8 6
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure you have to plot it, and not print it? Also have you learned Tkinter or any python GUI?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah i think i have to print it, but I haven't learned Tkinter or python GUI,is there any other way i can do it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I mean print as in the python command. That prints it out onto the screen</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that's what i meant, how to do it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure you have to graph?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, but may be i just have to print the line, is there any way to do this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Print line in console, not that I know of. But using matplotlib you can create visual files. Otherwise I'm not sure, sorry</span>
