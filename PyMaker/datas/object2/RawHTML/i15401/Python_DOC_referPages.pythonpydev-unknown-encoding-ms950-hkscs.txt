<p>I have a fresh install of Python 3.4 and Pydev with Eclipse Luna.</p>
<p>When I try to run a simple code (like <code>print("Hello")</code>) for the first time, I see this error: </p>
<pre><code>Fatal Python error: Py_Initialize: can't initialize sys standard streams
LookupError: unknown encoding: MS950_HKSCS
</code></pre>
<p>I assume that the system cannot find ms950_hkscs.py but I cannot find a similar file on the internet. </p>
<p>Does anyone know what the problem is and how this can be fixed? Thanks.</p>

<p>Try Right click on source file. 
-&gt; Properties. </p>
<p>and change file encoding. </p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>MS950_HKSCS</code> is not a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">supported encoding</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What should I do about it? Should I remove MS950_HKSCS from some kind of list?</span>
