<p>I feel stupid asking such a question, but I can't get it to work. I made a trivial regex to split strings with the following format :</p>
<pre><code>(15,20) (17,30 )   ( 40 ,  25)
</code></pre>
<p>I voluntarily let random blanks because it is legal in the format. My regex is pretty basic : <code>[^0-9-]+</code>, and <a href="http://regexr.com/3a5j9" rel="nofollow">works fine</a>. I'm familiar enough with regexes in Java and Scala so I first checked the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">doc of Python</a> to see the differences and it seems this regex is correct though it could be shorter.</p>
<p>Yet, it does not split anything.</p>
<p>Code :</p>
<pre><code>"(15,20) (17,30 )   ( 40 ,  25)".split("[^0-9-]+")
</code></pre>
<p>Output :</p>
<pre><code>['(15,20) (17,30 )   ( 40 ,  25)']
</code></pre>
<p>Any idea why such a simple regex does not work ?</p>

<p>You are <strong>not using a regular expression method</strong>. Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html" rel="nofollow"><code>re</code> module</a>; the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.split" rel="nofollow"><code>re.split()</code> function</a> does what you want just fine:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.split(r'[^0-9]+', '(15,20) (17,30 )   ( 40 ,  25)')
['', '15', '20', '17', '30', '40', '25', '']
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow"><code>str.split()</code> method</a> doesn't take a regular expression.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please include your code. The pattern works - if you use it right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I don't use it the same way, I had expected the split method on str would work the same way that on other languages I know</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dici: regular expressions are handled by a dedicated module so it can be maintained upgraded separately. A <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/regex" rel="nofollow noreferrer">new version</a> is being tested. Not all code needs the extra processing weight of regular expressions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's a fine explanation, thank you</span>
