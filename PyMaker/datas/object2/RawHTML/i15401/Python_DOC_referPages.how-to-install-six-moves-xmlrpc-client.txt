<p><code>six.moves</code> is a <em>virtual namespace</em>. It provides access to packages that were renamed between Python 2 and 3. As such, you shouldn't be installing anything.</p>
<p>By importing from <code>six.moves.xmlrpc_client</code> the developer doesn't have to handle the case where it is located at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/xmlrpclib.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>xmlrpclib</code></a> in Python 2, and at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.client.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>xmlrpc.client</code></a> in Python 3. Note that these are part of the <em>standard library</em>.</p>
<p>The mapping was added to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six/src/2828c8c72e975c326722c941c921b6f93498ea22/CHANGES?at=default#cl-135" rel="noreferrer"><code>six</code> version 1.5.0</a>; make sure you have that version or newer.</p>
<p>Mac comes with six version 1.4.1 pre-installed in <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python</code> and this will interfere with any version you install in <code>site-packages</code> (which is listed last in the sys.path).</p>
<p>The best work-around is to use a <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/" rel="noreferrer">virtualenv</a> and install your own version of <code>six</code> into that, together with whatever else you need for this project. Create a new virtualenv for new projects.</p>
<p>If you absolutely have to install this at the system level, then for this specific project you'll have to remove the <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python</code> path:</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys.path.remove('/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python')
</code></pre>
<p>This will remove various OS X-provided packages from your path for just that run of Python; Apple installs these for their own needs.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>pip uninstall six  
pip install six  
</code></pre>
<p>should solve the issue.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the answer. I just tried to install xmlrpclib using pip but fail, please see my update in the question. Can you please help? By the way, I'm not using Django.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EvanLi: you do <b>not</b> need to install <code>xmlrpclib</code>. It is part of the Python standard library.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EvanLi: What does <code>pip show six</code> show you have installed?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EvanLi: that is the Mac system version, and it is version 1.4.1.. hrmz, let me investigate. I see it on my system too.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@EvanLi: updated; your best option is to use a virtualenv (which isolates you from the Apple-supplied version).</span>
