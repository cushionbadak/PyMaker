<p>I am asking how to check to which list belongs user input. Scenario: I have 2 lists, one for vowels and one for constants, the user inputs a letter to know whether it is a Vowel of Constant, however I don't know how to check whether it is that or that (validation).</p>
<pre><code>vowels = ['A','E','I'] # First list
constants = ['B','C','D'] # Second List

userinput = input('Type in letter which you want to check to whether it is a vowel or constant: ') # User types in the letter Which he wants to know to which category does it belong
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>if userinput in vowels:
   # it's a vowel
   ...
elif userinput in consonants:
   # it's a consonant
   ...
else:
   # it's neither
   ...
</code></pre>
