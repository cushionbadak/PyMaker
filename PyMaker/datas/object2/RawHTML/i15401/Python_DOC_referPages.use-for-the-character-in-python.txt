<p>Is there some use for the <code>?</code> character in Python? I get an invalid syntax error when using it in variable names. Is there some syntax where it is valid?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what I can find on Google is mostly people asking how to implement the <code>?</code> operator from C, which is a different question.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#delimiters" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following printing ASCII characters are not used in Python. Their occurrence outside string literals and comments is an unconditional error:</p>
<p>$       ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So no, there isn't really a use for <code>?</code> in Python.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>No it's not a part of the language. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you think to look in the language documentation? The index has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/genindex-Symbols.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">section on symbols</a>, note that ? is not there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ternary if in <code>C</code> type language yes, but python uses <code>a if x else b</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">I’m pretty sure it’s not part of the language.</a> (Is that what you were asking?)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@U2744SNOWFLAKE why reopen the question? It's off topic for the site not having an actual programming problem right?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jamylak: Well, if it’s straightforward to a few people that it’s asking whether Python uses the <code>?</code> character at all, it seems on topic to me.</span>
