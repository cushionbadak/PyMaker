<p>A <code>dictionary</code> is unordered.</p>

<p>Using an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow"><code>OrderedDict</code></a> is not an option here, because you don't want to maintain order, but want to sort with different criteria.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">First: your python code is a mess of indentation. Nobody can read it, and second, what is the question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What functions do I use to sort my dictionary so it reads either alphabetically or highest to lowest?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python's dictionary is unordered; use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>OrderedDict</code></a> instead</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how do you use that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While they're an awesome tool to have in your python toolkit, <code>OrderedDict</code> is probably not the right data structure for this usecase, since a) you don't want the data to be in order of insertion but rather in several other sort orders, and b) you are going to be adding data as you go along.  Unless you rarely make additions and the sorting-upon-request is proving to be a bottleneck, it's better to go with @matthias' solution below.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The first one works but the second one doesnt</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's strange. I copied the code and the result from my Python console.</span>
