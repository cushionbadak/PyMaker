<p>I <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#building-python" rel="nofollow">installed Python 3.4.2</a> and Virtualenv 12.0.5 in my Linux Mint 17.1</p>
<p>Then I tried creating:
<code>$ virtualenv venv</code></p>
<p>And also using --clear and/or -p /usr/bin/python3.4, always getting the messages:</p>
<p><code>Using base prefix '/usr'
New python executable in venv/bin/python3
Also creating executable in venv/bin/python
ERROR: The executable venv/bin/python3 could not be run: [Errno 13] Permission denied</code></p>
<p>Another try was:
<code>$ pyvenv-3.4 venv</code></p>
<p>It gave no errors on creation, but in the venv/bin file the python3.4 is a symbolic link to /usr/local/bin/python3.4. Then when I activate and install any lib using pip or pip3, then try to import it, I get the error:
<code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ImportError: No module named 'anymoduledownloaded'</code></p>
<p>I always used virtualenv in Python 2.X and never got this kind of errors. Any thoughts on what am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>This is the output of my partitions (fdisk -l):</p>

<p>Is that a shared partition that you have mounted? Does the shared partition have a different filesystem then the non-shared one you tried upon? If yes, then IMO, that will definitely cause an error since you are making and compiling binaries for python on one filesystem, and so it will not work on another filesystem. </p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14761023/1860929">this answer</a>, adding to your /etc/fstab with an entry with <code>exec</code> flag might make it work for you, i.e., you might need to add another entry for the NTFS disk here to make it automount:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;file system&gt; &lt;mount point&gt;   &lt;type&gt;  &lt;options&gt;       &lt;dump&gt;  &lt;pass&gt;
-&gt; was on /dev/sdaX during installation
UUID=&lt;uid_of_NTFS&gt; /     ntfs    auto,user,exec,nodev,rw,errors=remount-ro 0       1

<p>I struggled with this as well so I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/marmalodak/centos_python3_django_setup/blob/master/mkenv3" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="ugly bash script">ugly bash script</a> to help me with this.  The only salient difference between what you do and what I do is on line 133:</p>
<pre><code>/path/to/python/bin/python3.4 /path/to/python/bin/pyvenv /path/to/venv
</code></pre>
<p>That is, explicitly name the instance of python and the venv tool.  Then</p>
<pre><code>/path/to/venv/bin/pip install django # or whatever
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<h2>Edit</h2>
<p>I installed Linux Mint in a VM to try and build a Python 3.4 virtual environment.  Based on the error messages I saw and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/22594608/1698426" title="this answer">this answer</a>, I learned that I must do the following to get a complete Python 3.4 build:</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev openssl
</code></pre>
<p>Without this, my Python 3.4 build did not contain pip.  Note that you probably want to install readline and other development packages. </p>
<hr/>
<h2>Unsolicited Advice</h2>
<ol>
<li>Do not do this as root, create a user dedicated to running your venv</li>
<li>Create a script to create your environment</li>
<li>Check that script into your source code repo</li>
</ol>
<p>I deleted my python binaries and venvs multiple times and then recreated all of with this script to make sure that my script reproduced my environment and then stripped the identifying information and saved that on github to share it.  I should really be using a more formal tool for this like docker/puppet/chef.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How did you install Python 3? Can you run <code>ls -lLa $(which python3)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I followed to python docs: ./configure; make; sudo make install; Command result: -rwxr-xr-x 2 root root 11598453 Jan 7 19:20 /usr/local/bin/python3</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StaticX Is that a shared partition that you have mounted? Check <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/14761023/1860929">this answer</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@mu 無 it certainly has to do with the shared partition. I tried on a non-shared partition and worked. But, I couldn't find this partition mounted in /etc/fstab.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StaticX Does the shared partition have a different filesystem then the non-shared one you tried upon? If yes, then IMO, that will definitely cause an error since you are making and compiling binaries for python on one filesystem, and so it will not work on another filesystem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This change had just crashed my system, turning it to a readonly filesystem. I couldn't open most of my programs and had to use a linux live-dvd to change back /etc/fstab.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice script, but still didn't solve my problem. I also forked and updated the Python and Django versions for you on GitHub. Thanks anyhow!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Exactly the same error message?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Actually, your script uses RPM (mkenv3: line 17: rpm: command not found).. and I am using Debian. But I already know that it has something to do with shared partition as @mu 無 wrote above. We could work out a way for this script being compatible with multiple distributions.</span>
