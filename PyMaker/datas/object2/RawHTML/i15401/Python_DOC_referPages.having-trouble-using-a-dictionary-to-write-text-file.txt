<p>I run it, it says <code>v</code> isn't defined. If I rewrite it <code>for k, v</code> then it doesn't have this error, but then the file doesn't change. The text file is just <code>sam-i-am</code>, with the <code>i</code>'s all lowercased. I'm trying to uppercase them and rewrite it. But can't quite seem to figure it out.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Changing <code>for k</code> to <code>for k, v</code> is correct since <code>dict.items</code> yields key/value pairs.  The reason your file is not updating is because <code>str.replace</code> does not work in-place.  Strings are immutable in Python, so the method always returns a new string.</p>
<p>This means that this line:</p>
<pre><code>line.replace(k, v)
</code></pre>
<p>is effectively a no-op.  To fix the problem, simply reassign <code>line</code> to this string so that its value is updated:</p>
<pre><code>line = line.replace(k, v)
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Also, the <code>new_file.write(line)</code> line should be dedented one level:</p>
<pre><code>for line in text:
    for k, v in replacement.items():
        line.replace(k, v)
    new_file.write(line) # &lt;-- moved back one level
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, you will write to the file for each item in the <code>replacement</code> dictionary.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Finally, you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement">with-statement</a> to have your files be closed automatically when you are done:</p>
<pre><code>replacement = {" i ": " I ", "-i-": "-I-"}
with open('samiam.txt', 'r+') as text, open('newfile.txt', 'w') as new_file:
    for line in text:
        for k, v in replacement.items():
            line = line.replace(k, v)
        new_file.write(line)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>text = open('samiam.txt', 'r+')
replacement = {" i ": " I ", "-i-": "-I-"}
new_file = open('newfile.txt', 'w')

for line in text:
    for k in replacement.keys():
        line=line.replace(k, replacement[k])
    new_file.write(line)


text.close()
new_file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>This should solve your problem.I can't run it right now , please tell me if you have problems.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">...When I load up new_file after doing this, I get the string repeated. Example: "I do not like them, sam-i-am. I do not like them, sam-I-am." ..any idea why this is happening?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because it's writing it in for loop.Which is why too many times you see that string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Andrea - See my edit.  You had your <code>write</code> line over too far.</span>
