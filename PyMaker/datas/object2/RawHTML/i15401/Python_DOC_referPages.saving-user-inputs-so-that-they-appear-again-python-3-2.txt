<p>I am trying to get my user input to save however, when i have tried doing so, this message comes up in the python shell:</p>
<pre><code> nf.write('\n'.join(tempword))
io.UnsupportedOperation: not writable
</code></pre>
<p>Here is my code for that section:</p>
<pre><code> clues_list=[]
    userInput=input("Enter a symbol you would like to replace:")
    userInput2=input("What letter would you like to replace it with:")

    for word in words_list:
        tempword = (word)
        tempword = tempword.replace('#','A')
        tempword = tempword.replace('*', 'M')
        tempword = tempword.replace('%', 'N')
        tempword=tempword.replace(userInput,userInput2)
        print(tempword)
        clues_list.append(tempword)
        with open('words.txt', 'r') as nf:# bit that isnt working 
            nf.write('\n'.join(tempword))
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, i want the user input to be displayed however that isnt happening. Can someone please explain to me why and what i need to do to fix it ?
Regards </p>

<p>Looks like you're opening <code>words.txt</code> as read only, then trying to write to it. Try instead:</p>
<pre><code>with open('words.txt', 'w') as nf:
    nf.write('\n'.join(tempword))
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this will blank your file before writing to it. If you need to append to the end of your file, use the <code>'a'</code> (<code>'append'</code>) mode instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">thank you however i just tried it with the 'a' for append and now all of a sudden a whole list of differnt symbols and letters show up one by one on the interpreter. I took out the append again however it still keeps happening</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@0123456 <code>file_obj.write</code> returns the number of characters in the string that was written <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html?highlight=file%20object#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">as per the docs</a>. You can safely ignore those since you're running in the interpreter, or just assign them to an unused variable (e.g. <code>_ = nf.write("\n".join(tempword))</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@0123456 note that this is the same thing that makes <code>2+2</code> show you <code>4</code> in the interpreter, but running that same code from the console shows you no output.</span>
