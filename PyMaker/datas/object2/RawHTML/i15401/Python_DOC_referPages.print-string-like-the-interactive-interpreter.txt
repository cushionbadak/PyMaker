<p>I like the way Python interactive interpreter prints strings, and I want to repeat that specifically in scripts. However, I can't seem to do that.</p>
<p>Example. I can do this in interpreter:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a="d\x04"
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
'd\x04'
</code></pre>
<p>However, I cannot replicate this in the python itself</p>
<pre><code>$ python -c 'a="d\x04";print a'
d
</code></pre>
<p>I want this because I want to debug a code with a lot of string with similar non-printable characters.</p>
<p>Is there an easy way to do this?</p>

<p>You're looking for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr" rel="nofollow"><code>repr()</code></a>: </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 'd\x04'
&gt;&gt;&gt; a

<p>Oh, that was fast.</p>
<p>I can just use <code>repr()</code> functon. That is, in my example,</p>
<pre><code>python -c 'a="d\x04";print repr(a)'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Make it a raw string (If possible) </p>
<pre><code>$ python -c 'a=r"d\x04";print a'
d\x04
$ python -c 'a="d\x04";print "%r"%a'
d\x04
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT</p>
<p>As you said that you cannot make it a raw string, Then you will have to use <code>repr()</code> as stated in the other answer.. </p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print("{!r}".format(a))</code> wil also work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PadraicCunningham Does <code>print "%r"%a</code> also mean the same?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BhargavRao, yes it is the repr output also</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PadraicCunningham Then  why was my answer downvoted?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PadraicCunningham chuck it. Thanks to the down vote I got a hat. Yippee. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I will accept your answer because it's better formated than my own :) thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might get a hat if you accept your own question :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Haha, well that's nice, but hats are for a few days while answers on SO stay for years :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is exactly what the interactive interpreter uses: if the result of the expression is not <code>None</code> it prints the <code>repr()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That makes it a completely different string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unfortunately, I do have a string that's not a "raw string" and I can't modify it in this way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KarelBÃ­lek This works too</span>
