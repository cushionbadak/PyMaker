<p>I'm using python 3 and have many virtual envs using pyvenv on mac osx 10.9.3. In all of them the command ./ runs my python code. In one of my envs the command has stopped working and I can not find anything about how to get it to begin working again. </p>
<p>EDIT: I get permission denied when typing out the whole file instead of tab (i.e. ./manage.py), and when I add sudo it works, but all the other venvs don't require sudo.</p>
<p>I'm searching through <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow">pyvenv docs</a> and searching through various bash links but can't get it to restore or know where that shortcut comes from. </p>
<p>When I type python [file] everything works as expected, but I want to restore the ./[file] I know it's going to be something easy but for some reason I can't figure out what to search to get the relevant solution.</p>

<p>When you type <code>./[tab]</code> and the file you're expecting doesn't come in linux shell, chances are you need to make the file executable:</p>
<pre><code>sudo chmod a+x manage.py
</code></pre>
<p>Or you don't have sufficient permissions to access the file:</p>
<pre><code>sudo chown user:group manage.py
</code></pre>
<p>(Be careful with the last one because it may lead to unexpected behaviour)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What's the error message?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">normally I tab and it finds the file. I typed out the whole ./manage.py and it says permission denied. I tried with sudo it works correctly, however all my other venvs don't require sudo</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried <code>sudo chmod a+x manage.py</code> or <code>sudo chown my_user:my_group manage.py</code> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no. Are those things that would restore the functionality to use ./ to run py files without sudo or onetime solutions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you should try the first one and see what happens. It makes the file executable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, sudo chmod a+x manage.py did work. Thanks for explaining</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should not need sudo if you have permissions you just need <code>chmod +x manage.py</code></span>
