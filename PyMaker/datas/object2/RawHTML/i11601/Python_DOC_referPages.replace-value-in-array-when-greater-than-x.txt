<p>I get a little problem with a simple idea. I have an array of data and I would like to replace each value if the value is greater than X.</p>
<p>To solve that, I wrote a little script as example which give the same idea :</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np

# Array creation

array = np.array([0.5, 0.6, 0.9825])

print array

# If value &gt; 0.7 replace by 0.

new_array = array[array &gt; 0.7] == 0

print new_array
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to obtain : </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [0.5, 0.6, 0] # 0.9825 is replaced by 0 because &gt; 0.7
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you if you could me help ;)</p>

<p>I wonder why this solution is not provided in the link @DonkeyKong provided:</p>
<pre><code>np.where(arr&gt;0.7, 0, arr)
#Out[282]: array([ 0.5,  0.6,  0. ])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>how about </p>
<pre><code>a = [0.5, 0.6, 0.9825]
b = [(lambda i: 0 if i &gt; 0.7 else i)(i) for i in a]
</code></pre>
