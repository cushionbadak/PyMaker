<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I need to write a program that checks to make sure a password inputted by the user passes the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contains at least eight characters.</li>
<li>Contains no more than 24 characters.</li>
<li>Consists of only letters, digits, and one of the special characters given below.</li>
<li>Contains at least two upper case letters.</li>
<li>Contains at least two lower case letters.</li>
<li>Contains at least two digits.</li>
<li>Contains one of the following special characters: !@#$%&amp;*()_</li>
</ul>
<p>I have everything working except for the "Consists of only letters, digits, and one of the special characters given below".</p>
<p>I have no idea what to write to check for this. Any ideas? Any tips on cleaning up the code or writing it more efficiently would also be appreciated.</p>
<pre><code>password = input("Enter a password: ")

import re

def main():
upper = sum([int(x.isupper()) for x in password])

lower = sum([int(x.islower()) for x in password])

digit = sum([int(x.isdigit()) for x in password])

length = len(password)

special = re.search("[!@#$%&amp;*()]", password)

if length &gt;= 8 and length &lt;=24:
    if upper &gt;=2:
        if lower &gt;=2:
            if digit &gt;=1:
                if special:
                    print("Acceptable password.")
                else:
                    print("Unacceptable.")
main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Create a pool of allowed characters and use the power of a <code>set</code> to check for unwanted characters.</p>
<pre><code>import string
pool = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + '!@#$%&amp;*()_'
</code></pre>
<p>This will give you <code>'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%&amp;*()_'</code>.</p>
<p>Now you can check the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?#set.difference" rel="nofollow"><code>difference</code></a> between the password and your pool of characters. Let your password be <code>'ABCD§12'</code>.</p>
<pre><code>set(password).difference(pool)
</code></pre>
<p>This code will give you <code>{'§'}</code>.</p>
<p>So you just have to check for the length of the result of the difference. If it is <code>0</code> everything is fine.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Every time I see a password constrains like your number 3. I know that the underlying password storage is most likely not safe and I avoid such services. Salt and hash the passwords and there is no need for such a constraint.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KlausD. this is likely homework, not security.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Look into the built-in function <code>any()</code> and the operator <code>in</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is in fact a homework assignment.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@CoryNorell yes, and it is in fact <i>your</i> homework assignment, so it's not clear why you're here cheating on it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I believe this is exactly what I need. Thank you very much!</span>
