<p>I am not sure what I am doing wrong. I keep getting an invalid syntax error on the line with the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<pre><code>def main():

    outfile = open('numbers.txt','w')
    outfile.write[input('Enter a value: ')
                  for i in range(10)]:
        print(i)
    outfile.close()

main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Whatever it is you are trying to do with that <code>outfile.write</code> line has two main syntax errors that you need to be careful about. </p>
<p>First, <code>write</code> is a method, and you are not treating it as such. So you need to use <code>()</code>. Furthermore, remove the <code>:</code>. I am not sure what you are trying to do with those colons and the print statement. But that is not valid syntax. On second inspection, it seems like you are trying to print each <code>i</code>. With the methodology you are using to capture your input by using a comprehension, you cannot print the output like that, as the <code>i</code> is no longer in scope by the time you are printing that <code>i</code>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you will not be able to write a list to a file with the methodology you are using. So, chances are you are looking to write the string representation of those list values. You should use the <code>join</code> method to do this: </p>
<pre><code>outfile.write(' '.join([input('Enter a value: ') for i in range(10)]))
</code></pre>
<p>To explain the <code>join</code>. What this will do is take the list you created and create a string out of your list entries, by separating each entry by a space. So if for example you have a list as: </p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
</code></pre>
<p>Calling <code>' '.join()</code> on it, will create a string separated by a space as: </p>
<pre><code>1 2 3 4 5
</code></pre>
<p>So, your final functional code looks like: </p>
<pre><code>def main():

    outfile = open('numbers.txt','w')
    outfile.write(' '.join([input('Enter a value: ') for i in range(10)]))
    outfile.close()

main()
</code></pre>
<p>It is important to note, that a good practice here when dealing with file objects is to use a context manager, which would change your code to look like: </p>
<pre><code>def main():
    with open('numbers.txt', 'w') as outfile:
        outfile.write(' '.join([input('Enter a value: ') for i in range(10)]))
</code></pre>
<p>The context manager is denoted by using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#with" rel="nofollow">with</a> statement. Some more suggested reading on file objects can be found in the documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>If your code is the same as you have here, you have two issues:</p>
<p><code>outfile.write()</code> Needs to have parentheses since it is a function call.</p>
<p>Your indentation is messed up. To have a for loop, you should have something like</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(10):
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p>If you have brackets like you do in your code, you'll have a list comprehension, but the syntax should be like the following:</p>
<pre><code>outfile.write([input('Enter a value: ' for _ in range(10)])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The first error is with the line for i in range(10)]. It should be for i in range(10).</p>
<p>The next errors are occurring on the line directly prior to the for loop:</p>
<p><code>outfile.write[input('Enter a value: ')</code> should be <code>outfile.write(raw_input('Enter a value: '))</code>.</p>
<p><code>[</code> needed to be <code>(</code>, and <code>raw_input</code> was substituted for <code>input</code> so as to write a <code>string</code> value to the file.</p>
<p>Finally, so as to request input 10 times from the user to write each to a new line of the file, outfile's write method needed to be placed in the loop</p>
<p>The final formatted code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>def main():

    outfile = open('numbers.txt','w')
    for i in range(10):
        outfile.write(raw_input('Enter a value: ') + '\n')
    outfile.close()

main()

<span class="comment-copy">Is this the indentation you have in your script?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>write</code> is a method, it needs parenthesis around the argument.  That line shouldn't end a colon.  And your <code>print</code> attempt won't work as you expect.   Lastly, you can't write a list to a file that way.  The entire approach seems flawed, however.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I voted to close as "Too Broad" on the basis that complete answers would either have to explain a great deal of content to you so you could figure this out yourself or would just do the assignment for you. I highly recommend finding some basic Python learning material and practice at combining simple elements of code to produce more complex behavior.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That was unnecessary, as I am in a beginner Python class and i was going by my textbook when writing this code. I came here as a last resort for help, as that is what this site is for. My code wasn't completely terrible, just missing a few things so thank you for kicking someone when they were down and actually trying to learn the material.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Forgot to mention that the <code>i</code> is not in scope at <code>print(i)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cricket_007 It would be if the <code>for</code> line was indented reasonably and there wasn't a weirdo <code>]</code> in the middle of it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cricket_007 TBH I had no idea how to interpret what that <code>print(i)</code> was doing. On a second look, it seems like OP is trying to output each <code>i</code>. So yes, I will edit to mention that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jpmc26 the <code>i</code> appears to be intended as part of the list comprehension.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cricket_007 updated. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am getting syntax that raw_input is not defined</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you are using Python 3.x, raw_input was renamed to input</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I am using Python 3.4. Thank you!</span>
