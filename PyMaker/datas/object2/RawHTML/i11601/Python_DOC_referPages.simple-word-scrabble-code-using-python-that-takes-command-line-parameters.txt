<p>I am trying to create a simple word scrabble script that finds words score values. The script should reads two parameters from the command line and display the best word value, which returns the word with highest point value. I have created a constructor that reads the file and populate a dictionary of letter/value for use with the remaining methods of the class. For example the command line parameters should look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>scrabble.py c:\tiles.txt apple,squash  
Output: The best value is squash with 18. 
</code></pre>
<p>Here is what I have so far. I know that import argv is helful, but not sure how to get started.</p>
<pre><code>from sys import argv

class Scrabble:
    def __init__(self, tilesFile):
        with open(tilesFile, "r") as f:
            lines = [ line.strip().split(":") for line in f ]

        self.tiles = { k:int(v) for k,v in lines }

    def getWordValue(self, word):
        sum = 0
        for letter in word.upper():
            sum += self.tiles[letter]

        return sum

    def getBestWord(self):
        pass


def main():
    s1 = Scrabble("tile_values.txt")
    value = s1.getWordValue("hello")
    print(value)


if __name__ == '__main__':
   main()
   pass

<p><strike>What you need is to use the <code>argparse</code> module
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html</a></strike></p>
<p>I took your example and added argparse.</p></div>

<p>You can get the arguments you script was passed on the command line with <code>sys.argv</code>.</p>
<pre><code>from sys import argv
print("This is a list of all of the command line arguments: ", argv)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What's the specific problem that's keeping you from being able to do this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your response. I am not sure how to use input from command line parameters, instead of using  python input--- value = s1.getWordValue("hello")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you unsure how to <i>use</i> the input, or unsure how to <i>get</i> the input?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Unsure how to use the input from command line parameters</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could initialize a <code>Scabble</code> object, and then call the <code>getWordValue()</code> method on the input argument.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for your help. I am student and my professor wants us to import argv from sys. Anyway you can help me with that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok. I will update my code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Take a look. Just remember to add some good error checking in your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also if this answer solved your question, please mark it as accepted.</span>
