<p>I have tried several methods of removing the <code>$</code> from a column of values that looks like [$95,800.50].</p>
<p>I want to call <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> on a column of salaries but first I must parse it as a float but can't because of the <code>$</code>. </p>
<pre><code>import csv
f = open("Employee_Salaries_-_2014.csv") 
rows = csv.reader(f)
next(rows)   

class employeeInfo:
    gender = ""
    salary = 0
    title = ""

employee = []

for col in rows:
    e = employeeInfo()
    e.gender = col[1]
    e.salary = col[2]
    e.title = col[9]

    employee.append(e)
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>.lstrip("$")</code> to strip the "$" from in front. This avoids removing the first character in the case where your code is fed a salary without a "$" in front"<br/>
For example:</p>
<pre><code>e.salary = col[2].lstrip("$")
</code></pre>
<p>BTW, consider storing your salaries at as int's (do everything in cents instead of dollars) because floats are not exact, for example 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3 . Or You could use python's built in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow">decimal</a> library instead. </p>

<p>You may not have realized this, but python does not allow commas in strings when converting into one of the numeric types.</p>
<p>If the data is a string, you can use <code>translate</code>. if it's unicode, IIRC there might be some edge cases and <code>replace</code> is a better option</p>
<pre><code>e.salary = col[2].translate(None, '$,')
e.salary = col[2].replace('$', '').replace(',','')
</code></pre>
<p>the suggestion to use <code>col[2].lstrip('$')</code> above is great BUT you need to replace the <code>,</code> in the salary before casting it to float .</p>
<pre><code>e.salary = col[2].lstrip('$').replace(',','')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try:</p>
<pre><code>e.salary = col[2][1:]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Asking the same question again when you don't get an answer the first time is strongly frowned on here; repeat offenses can eventually result in a ban. Edit your first instance of the question to improve it, don't simply re-ask. (Once you've earned enough reputation, you can also place bounties for questions that aren't getting enough attention, but that's an earned privilege).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">...since you've already gotten answers on the new copy, deleting the old one might be the best approach -- but do avoid making the same mistake again.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you also need to remove the commas?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This works on one value, but I still need to remove the $ from  one column of salaries which spans 9000 rows. Then I need to parse as a float and call min and max. Thanks a bunch!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why? How is this different from what the OP is doing?</span>
