<p>I'm a newbie to Python and I came across this question somewhere:</p>
<p>"Produce a programme that can calculate the perimeter of the triangle, the area of the triangle and the height of the triangle from the length of the three sides of a triangle. If the three lengths of the sides of the triangle do not define a valid triangle, a message should be displayed stating that this is not a valid calculation and the process should be terminated."</p>
<p>Anyone know how this could be solved? It's probably easy, but I'm a newbie so yeah </p>
<p>This is what I've got so far:</p>
<pre><code>a = float(input('Please Enter the First side of a Triangle: '))

b = float(input('Please Enter the Second side of a Triangle: '))

c = float(input('Please Enter the Third side of a Triangle: '))

if  a + b &gt;= c and b + c &gt;= a and c + a &gt;= b:

# calculate area and height here


Perimeter = a + b + c

s = (a + b + c) / 2

Area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5

print("\n The Perimeter of Triangle = %.2f" %Perimeter);

print(" The Area of a Traiangle is %0.2f" %Area)     
else:
print('Not a valid triangle')
</code></pre>
<p>I still have to calculate the height. Everything else seems to be working now :D</p>

<p>In mathematics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality" rel="nofollow">triangle inequality</a> states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>a, b, c = 1, 1, 1 # sides of a triangle
if a + b &gt;= c and b + c &gt;= a and c + a &gt;= b:
    # calculate area and height here
else:
    print('Not a valid triangle')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Post the code sample that you tried , so that it will be easy for people to answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Remove the <code>a, b, c = 1, 1, 1</code> line and move your three <code>input()</code> lines before the if statement to make it work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can get the height with sin, cos or tan... In python you can access these through the math package... (<code>import math</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, check what I added to my original post</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there no easier way to go about calculating the height?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not that I know of, maybe you can find a library for that but I really doubt it, the functions are all there if you know how to calculate it in a calculator. Here a list of all math functions: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/math.html</a></span>
