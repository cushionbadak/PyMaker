<p>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python has a project in chapter 8:
Create a Mad Libs program that reads in text files and lets the user add their own text anywhere the word ADJECTIVE, NOUN, ADVERB, or VERB appears in the text file.</p>
<p>It needs to create the new text file and print the results to the screen.</p>
<p>My solution causes a blank new file to be created and shows nothing in terminal. I am using Python 3.5.1 on OS X.</p>

<p>Take a look at this code:</p>
<pre><code>data = "a ADJECTIVE NOUN VERB ADVERB to the NOUN to VERB some NOUN"
for part_of_speech in ["ADJECTIVE", "NOUN", "ADVERB", "VERB"]:
    while data.find(part_of_speech) &gt; -1:
        data = data.replace(part_of_speech, input("enter a %s: " % (part_of_speech.lower())), 1)

print(data)

</ul>
<p>Also try adding <code>print(line)</code> under your for loop to understand your program better. As others have said, debugging skills are one of the most important things you'll learn as you develop your programming.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What's the content of <code>madLibProject.txt</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What's your question? BTW if an input line contains more than the word "NOUN", etc., the <code>==</code> test won't do what you want, esp. if the line contains more than one substitution word.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you step through the program in a debugger, or at least do an accurate job of simulating by hand how the program runs, step by step, you'll uncover multiple problems.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just edited a stupid mistake out of my answer, but I think it's all good now.</span>
