<p>I need to concatenate a few large files in Python, and came across a helpful snippet of code here, but am having trouble understanding a small part of it. Here is the code: </p>
<pre><code>filenames = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', ...]
     with open('path/to/output/file', 'w') as outfile:
          for fname in filenames:
               with open(fname) as infile:
                    for line in infile:
                         outfile.write(line)
</code></pre>
<p>The only thing I don't understand is what the 'w' is supposed to represent, so it would be great if someone explained it. Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you open a file, you must specify a mode in which it will be opened. The character <code>'w'</code> stands for 'write', and it means that the file will be opened for writing, after it has been truncated.</p>
<p>Subsequent calls to <code>open()</code> in your code snippet (<code>with open(fname) as infile</code>) need not explicitly define a mode, since <code>'r'</code> (which stands for 'read') is the default mode used when calling <code>open()</code>. They are equivalent to writing:</p>
<pre><code>with open(fname, 'r') as infile:
    # rest of code here
</code></pre>
