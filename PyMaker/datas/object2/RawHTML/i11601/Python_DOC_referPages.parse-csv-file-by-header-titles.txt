<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a couple of CSV files with information about different users. Every file has 3 or 4 columns with the first rows being the titles and the respective information underneath it. Such as:</p>
<pre><code>Username  FirstName  LastName  Occupation
JSmith12  John       Smith     Staff
</code></pre>
<p>Some of the columns are out of order or missing in half of the CSV files so I can't simply do <em>row.split(',')[0]</em> to get all the Usernames in all CSV files.</p>
<p>My question here is: How would I be able to get and read all the column information by the header titles and not by rows.</p>

<p>Look into using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader" rel="nofollow"><code>DictReader</code> class</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat test.csv
Username,FirstName,LastName,Occupation
JSmith12,John,Smith,Staff
$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; import csv
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open("test.csv") as f:
...     reader = csv.DictReader(f)
...     for row in reader:
...         print(row)
... 
{'Username': 'JSmith12', 'LastName': 'Smith', 'FirstName': 'John', 'Occupation': 'Staff'}
</code></pre>
<p>Every <code>row</code> would be a dictionary where keys were extracted from the csv file headers.</p>

<p>The <code>csv</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">library</a> in the Python Standard Library contains a class called <code>DictReader</code> that does what you want.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. But how can I just read one column at a time? I tried print row['Username'] and it gives me all the usernames but then also gives me a Traceback error. Also when I try Occupation, it doesnt print anything but another error</span>
