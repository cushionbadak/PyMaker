<p>Just wondering how I would store the inputs for an average sum of square roots problem.</p>
<p>The user can input as many numbers as they until they type 'end'</p>
<p>here is what i have for that</p>
<pre><code>while(True):
    x = input("Enter a number please:")
    if x == 'end':
        break
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can append these values to a list. Sum and then divide by the length for the average.</p>
<pre><code>nums = []
while True:
    x = input("Enter a number:")
    if x == 'end':
        avg = sum(nums) / len(nums)
        print("And the average is....", avg)
        break
    elif x.isdigit():
        nums.append(int(x))
    else:
        print("Try again.")
</code></pre>

<p>The next thing you'd want to learn about is a data structure such a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow">list</a>. You can then add items to the list on the fly with <code>list.append</code>.</p>
<p>However, it's noteworthy that where ever you're learning Python from will certainly go over lists at one point or another.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you mean that you want to store all the x values given, just use a list. l = [] l.append(x).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks a buddy of mine suggested i append the values as well was not quite sure how to do it until now!</span>
