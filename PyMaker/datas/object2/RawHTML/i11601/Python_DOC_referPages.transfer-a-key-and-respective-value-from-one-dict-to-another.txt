<p>I have a main dict with a certain number of keys e.i.</p>
<pre><code>dict1 = {NAME: John, Second_Name: Doe}
</code></pre>
<p>I have a series of this dicts and all of them are inside a list.
Is there a way to loop through this list and create a list with dictionaries with, for example, only the key NAME and respective value? Is there a straightforward way to do this?</p>
<p>PS: I'm using dict1 as an example as in my program I'm working with dicts with a lot more keys.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'd use a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>list_of_dicts = [
    {'NAME': 'John', 'Second_Name': 'Doe'},
    {'NAME': 'Tim', 'Second_Name': 'Doh'},
    {'NAME': 'Mark', 'Second_Name': 'Dough'},
]

names_only = [{'NAME': d['NAME']} for d in list_of_dicts]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a>:</p>
<pre><code>[{'NAME': d['NAME']} for d in dictionaries]
</code></pre>
<p>That will raise a <code>KeyError</code> if <code>NAME</code> is not found.  You can use a default instead like this:</p>
<pre><code>[{'NAME': d.get('NAME', 'unknown')} for d in dictionaries]
</code></pre>
<p>for each dictionary, <code>d</code>, in <code>dictionaries</code>, it creates a dictionary with a single key, <code>NAME</code>, that has the value of <code>d['NAME']</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">ForeverWintr I figured the problem. The list with the dicts was being created inside a list so the program was raising that help. Thanks for all the help to you and @zondo</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That seems a good answer. If I want to add a set of keys instead of just one do you know what changes should I do to this code for that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NunoChicória: Same idea.  Pretend you are in a <code>for</code> loop.  You can create however long a dictionary you want.  You might use <code>{'NAME': d['NAME'], 'SecondName': d['SecondName']}</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zondo I'm getting this error (TypeError: list indices must be integers, not str). Do you know how could I work around this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NunoChicória, that error probably means that <code>d</code> is actually a list, not a dictionary. You should edit your question to show what you're trying.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zondo I edit the question now with the code I have and explaining the problem I am facing.</span>
