<p>Can someone explain why some people use this kind of symbols in their code? it's kind of confusing for me and maybe for all the newbies out there.</p>
<p>I am learning Python and I reached a lesson where i should build a web-crawler (spider),in the example they use only how to grab data from a specific url in a specific way i looked in the internet for a general way and found this Code with lot of symbols i know some of them but the rest i have no clue here is a chunk of the code i found with symbols</p>
<pre><code>import sys, thread, Queue, re urllib, urlparse, time, os
dupcheck = set()
q=Queue.Queue(100)
q.put(sys.argv[1])
def queueURLs(html,originalink):
for url in re.findall('"'&lt;a[^&gt;]+href["'](.`[^"']+)["']'"', html,re.I):)
</code></pre>
<p>what does symbols like this ^&gt; mean in the code
 i know that a stand for anchor 
 and what href stands for but those symbols are confusing</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>They are <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax" rel="nofollow">regular expressions</a> and you should probably not be parsing HTML using them.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>These symbols, when used inside a string don't have a particular meaning in python.</p>
<p>However, they mean something while used in strings passed to modules that handle regular expressions like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">re</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Other answers have already alluded to the fact that the use of the 'symbols' (read: operators) are for defining regular expressions. For the line in question:</p>
<pre><code>for url in re.findall('"'&lt;a[^&gt;]+href["'](.`[^"']+)["']'"', html,re.I):)
</code></pre>
<p>For regular expressions, using the <code>^</code> character inside a set definition, i.e. <code>[^abcd]</code> indicates a match only if the character is NOT 'a', 'b', 'c' or 'd'.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html</a> for more information on regular expressions and their usage in Python.</p>
