<p>I refactored some of my code and put it in individual directories, and suddenly the interpreter can't find any of my custom modules.  </p>
<p>My package structure looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>etl3
    __init__.py
    inst_config
        __init__.py
        config3.py
    inst_utils
        __init__.py
        etc...
    jira
        filetorun.py
    etc...
</code></pre>
<p>I'm trying to run the file in the jira directory.  When it was just under the <code>etl3\</code> directory it can find it due to them being in the same directory.  Once nested however, it cannot find them.  </p>
<p>I run the python interpreter, and print my <code>sys.path</code>.  I can see the path to <code>C:\etl3\inst_config\</code> on there, which is why I'm confused as to why my file in the <code>jira</code> directory can't find it.  </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When the <code>inst_config</code> folder is on the path you would simply import the files from it directly:</p>
<pre><code>import config3
</code></pre>
<p>However when <code>C:\etl3\</code> is on your PATH you can import modules that are defined there, in this case it would be the package <code>inst_config</code> and a submodule of it:</p>
<pre><code>import inst_config.config3
# or
from inst_config import config3
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>from etl3.inst_config import YourClassHere
</code></pre>
<p>(recommended), or</p>
<pre><code>import etl3.inst_config.config3
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What are the errors?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>ImportError: No module named 'inst_config'</code>.  That module is just where it's been for the last however long.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On my <code>sys.path</code> I can see the module...  I'm not sure why python isn't correctly finding my module</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you need to show the actual structure of your project, and how you are trying to use import.  The way packages work is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages" rel="nofollow noreferrer">well documented</a>.  If you cannot answer your own question from the documentation then add much more information to your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if <code>config3</code> is in a folder that is on <code>sys.path</code> then you would just do <code>import config3</code> that is how the PATH works!   Otherwise put <code>C:\etl3</code> on your path.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hmm, I tried this as well and it didn't work.  I'm using Python3.5 if that makes a difference in this case.</span>
