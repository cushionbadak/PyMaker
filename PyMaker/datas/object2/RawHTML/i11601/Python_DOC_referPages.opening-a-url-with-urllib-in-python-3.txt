<p>i'm trying to open the URL of this API from the sunlight foundation and return the data from the page in json. this is the code Ive produced, minus the parenthesis around myapikey.</p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request.urlopen
import json

urllib.request.urlopen("https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/legislators?api_key='(myapikey)")
</code></pre>
<p>and im getting this error</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;input&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ImportError: No module named request.urlopen
</code></pre>
<p>what am i doing wrong? ive researched into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html" rel="noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html</a> and still no progress</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to use <code>from urllib.request import urlopen</code>, also I suggest you use the <code>with</code> statement while opening a connection.</p>
<pre><code>from urllib.request import urlopen

with urlopen("https://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/legislators?api_key='(myapikey)") as conn:
    # dosomething
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python 3 You can implement that this way:</p>
<pre><code>import urllib.request
u = urllib.request.urlopen("xxxx")#The url you want to open
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Pay attention:</strong>
Some IDE can <code>import urllib</code>(Spyder) directly, while some need to <code>import urllib.request</code>(PyCharm).</p>
<p>That's because you sometimes need to explicitly import the pieces you want, so the module doesn't need to load everything up when you just want a small part of it.</p>
<p>Hope this will help.</p>

<p><code>urllib.request</code> is a module whereas <code>urlopen</code> is a function.

<span class="comment-copy">maybe i dont fully understand this concept yet im fairly new to python, but once i enter the code youve given i get an indentation error for line 4 (the empty line following as conn:) is there additional code i should be using to follow this? i dont wnat you to write my program for me, necessarily but any resources would be greatly appreciated. or gen. info</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BradleyD.Freeman-Bain: you can't have a <code>with</code>-statement without the following block. To avoid <code>SyntaxError</code>, add any code even mere <code>pass</code> will do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">hi, if you post code, you can format it as code so that whitespaces are kept like you entered them and syntax highlighting is done. To do this select your code and click the curly braces in the editor, or indent the code with four spaces. I did that for you on this answer. Also it would be nice if you could write a little bit to explain your code.</span>
