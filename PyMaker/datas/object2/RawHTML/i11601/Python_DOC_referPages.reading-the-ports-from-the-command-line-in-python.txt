<p>I need to read ports from the command line in my python Script.
For example, from the script, I need to prompt the user to enter the ports that he wants to connect to. The user will enter at the command prompt 1/2, 1/3/4, 5/6 etc. I need to store each of these in an array and then using the array indexing I need to access them later. Can any one please suggest me how to do it?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You should use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow">split method</a> of strings.</p>
<p>Example in Python 3 :</p>
<pre><code>ports = input("Provide the ports separated by slashes : ") # User inputs "4/21/49"
ports = ports.split("/")

print(ports) # ['4','21','49']
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Be careful</strong>, the list values will be strings and not integers.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the answer Aurel. It did work.                                                   ports = input("Provide the ports separated by slashes : ") ports = ports.split(",") print "ports[2] = " print ports[0]</span>
