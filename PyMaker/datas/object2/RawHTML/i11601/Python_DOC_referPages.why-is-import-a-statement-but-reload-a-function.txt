<p>I know how to use both, but I'm curious why the decision was made to make one a statement and the other a function.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First of all you can import using a function, from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">importlib's documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.__import__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__import__()</code></a> function<br/>
     The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#import" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>import</code></a> statement is syntactic sugar for this function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for instance both of these statements are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>from random import randint as random_int

random_int = __import__("random").randint
</code></pre>
<p>However the <code>import</code> statement greatly benefits from alternate syntax where as <code>reload</code> does not really have any alternate meaning.</p>
<p>I can also imagine a lot of beginner programmers making this mistake if reload was it's own statement:</p>
<pre><code>from random import *
reload random #does not affect the current namespace!
</code></pre>
<p>Since the <code>reload</code> function requires a module (which is not preduced with <code>from _ import *</code>) coders may wonder why the names imported are not reloaded. related to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6310157/5827215">this answer</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Never thought about that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">because the <code>import</code> statement benefits from alternate syntax like <code>from __ import __ as __</code> where as <code>reload</code> only ever needs the module object to re use it's loader.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>import</code> is used to import modules, <code>reload()</code> can also load certain parts of a module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cricket_007 if it was a statement it would just as easily be written <code>reload random #name</code> as appose to <code>reload(random) #module object</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd possibly check when the <code>reload</code> function was added. Since it's such a common name, I figure it would break a lot of existing code if it suddenly became a keyword.</span>
