<p>I want to use <code>tempfile</code> module, to generate files and keep them in <code>/tmp/myfolder/</code> and keep them there until a certain time (maybe in days). I learned that <code>tempfile</code> removes file as soon as <code>f.close()</code> is run. I just don't want it to auto-remove. Will remove later. Is this possible with <code>tempfile</code>? or any other better approach?</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile" rel="nofollow">this</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import tempfile
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, dir='/tmp/myfolder') as outfile:
    # ...
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You are, of course, free to make a folder in <code>/tmp</code> and write/maintain your own files in there. <code>tempfile</code> does not sound suitable for your use-case anyway. Also, I wrote a module <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/seqfile" rel="nofollow noreferrer">seqfile</a>, which allows me to write to files on disk without worrying about overwriting files being written by other threads/processes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe what you want is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want to retain files then it is not a good idea to store them in <code>/tmp</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you want your code to also auto-delete them after &lt;period&gt; in days? (Alternatively you could use Unix <code>cron</code>, or an inverted <code>find -newer ... | xargs</code> or something)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Seems OP wants code to also auto-delete them after &lt;period&gt; in days?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@smci: Please don't speculate about what OP might have wanted a year ago.  If you have related questions, feel free to post them separately.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">not speculation. Read what the OP wrote <b>"keep them there until a certain time (maybe in days).... I just don't want it to auto-remove [at file close]. Will remove later"</b>. As such, your answer doesn't fully address their requirements.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@smci: I'm not sure who you think you are helping here.  This question is more than a year old.  Good day.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">JohnZwinck your answer does not fully address the OP's question. It's utterly irrelevant whether it was asked 1 hour ago or 1 year ago. Also the fact that the OP did not return to SO since 5/2016 to reply and point out that it didn't address it is not relevant. Auto-deleting tempfiles after a time threshold in Python is interesting and useful and I was genuinely looking forward to seeing a solution. Who that "would be helping" would be all Python users with a similar issue. There's absolutely no need to talk down to me.</span>
