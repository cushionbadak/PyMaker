<p>I'm trying to build dynamic operations using a config file, python and ConfigParser. I'm fairly new to Python (2 weeks old) so I'm not sure if this is even possible, which is why I thought I'd ask.</p>
<p>Here's a sample config file:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>[General]
Volume File = C:\Users\O\Desktop\Sanjeev\Python\Solution\volume.xlsx
New Variables File = C:\Users\O\Desktop\Sanjeev\Python\Solution\newvar.xlsx
Desired Variable Name = Price,Age
Merging Variables = Category,State
[Operations]
Operation1 = Price*Volume,Revenue
Operation2 = Revenue/Age,Annual Revenue
</code></pre>
<p>So here I would use the merging variables to merge the first and second dataset, retaining and possibly aggregating the desired variables. Then, based on the operations specified in the operations section, I would execute and store them in a variable with the same name as the second item in the list.</p>
<p>The reason I want to specify these operations in a config file rather in a python script is because the number and type of these operations will vary. I need to create dynamic code that will be able to parse this option in the config file as if it were code and execute it.</p>
<p>I would like some direction on how to get started.</p>

<p>You can use code introspection using the design pattern "Factory" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern</a> if you are familiar with object oriented programming.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can look at the <code>eval</code> and the <code>exec</code> functions: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval</a></p>
<p>Here is an example of using the eval function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; first_parameter = 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; second_parameter = 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; result = eval("first_parameter * second_parameter")
&gt;&gt;&gt; result
20
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, you can do this.  Go ahead and code it up.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Eval was what I was looking for. It takes input directly from the config file and converts it to code.</span>
