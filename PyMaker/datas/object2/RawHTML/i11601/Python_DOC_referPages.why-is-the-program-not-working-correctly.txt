<p>I'm doing a project for school and one of the tasks is to create a program that will tell the user how long it took them to type in the alphabet correctly. </p>
<p>It always says "Try again" no matter if the input is correct or not; I'm not really sure what I did wrong.</p>
<p>I'd much appreciate if someone could help me tackle this problem.</p>
<pre><code>def game():
    import time

    start_time=time.time()
    alphabet = input("Type in the aphabet :  ")
    alphabet = alphabet.capitalize()

    if alphabet == "A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z":
        print("Well done.")
        end_time=time.time()-start_time
        print("It took you :{0:.2f}".format(end_time),"seconds.")
    elif alphabet == "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ":
        print("Well done.")
        end_time=time.time()-start_time
        print("It took you :{0:.2f}".format(end_time),"seconds.")
    else:
        print("Try again....")
        game()
    print()

    again = input("Do you want to try again? Y or N ")
    again = again.capitalize()
    if again == "Y":
        game()
    elif again == "N":
        print("Goodbye.") 
    else:
        print("Try again...")
        game()
game()

<p>Str.capitalize only capitalises the first letter not the whole word. You want str.upper()</p>
