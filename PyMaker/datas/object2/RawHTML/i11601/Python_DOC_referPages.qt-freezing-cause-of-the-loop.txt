<p>I have designed a gui with PYQT4. It has two buttons. One of start button. It starts a start.py file. And another button execute stop.py file that stop start.py pid.</p>
<p>This start.py and stop.py files are on a remote location. I am connecting there with ssh and paramiko. </p>
<p>When I click to start button, gui is freezing and never answering. I can only get rid of the situation by closing the program . I know the problem. Because  there is a while loop in start.py and it never ends. </p>
<p>When i click to start button its wait for the while loop.</p>
<p>I want to run start.py and i dont want to wait for the loop. It must be run in background or etc.. </p>
<p>What can i do ? I tried to trigger it with another .py file. I used subprocess method. But no success. Still have same problem. </p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt/Threading,_Signals_and_Slots" rel="nofollow">PyQT theading</a>.
You can also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" rel="nofollow">asyncio</a> if you are using python3.</p>

<p>I found the solution. I covered that function in thread. And now its working properly without freeze or lag.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I use python 2.7. If its possible I want to do this on remote location. Not on gui.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Murat This is not a good idea, you are spawning a full python interpreter for each task.</span>
