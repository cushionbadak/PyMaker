<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a microcontroller connected to my computer via I2C connection, which sends back 1 byte of data at a time. I am trying to send a 4-byte number to the python program. I receive it in an array of individual bytes like this <code>[123,45,67,89]</code>.</p>
<p>I need to convert that back into an integer in python. I am trying to use struct.unpack to do this, but I cannot get the data format correct. I am trying to get it in the form:</p>
<pre><code>struct.unpack("I",b'x12\x34\x56\x78)
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know how to get the 4 bytes into the form required by struct. I can convert the numbers to hex, but don't know how to string them together.</p>

<p>You could convert it to a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-bytearray" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>bytearray</code></a> and pass that to <code>struct.unpack()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>import struct

data = [123, 45, 67, 89]

# Show hex values of data.
print(list('%02x' % b for b in data))  # -&gt; ['7b', '2d', '43', '59']

# Convert to 4 byte unsigned integer data interpreting data as being in 
# little-endian byte order.
value = struct.unpack("&lt;I", bytearray(data))[0]
print(hex(value))  # -&gt; 0x59432d7b
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I reformed it. Hopefully it is clearer.</span>
