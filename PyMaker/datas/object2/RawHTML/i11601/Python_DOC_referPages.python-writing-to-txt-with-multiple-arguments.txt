<p>I have this program that asks the user to complete 10 maths questions, each time they get an answer correct, 1 point is added to their score.</p>
<pre><code>current_class = Classes[student_class]
class_score = open(current_class, 'r+')
class_format = (name, "has a score of", Score)
class_score.write(class_format)
print(class_score.read())
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I read the .txt file it returns the error </p>
<pre><code>TypeError: must be str, not tuple
</code></pre>
<p>I want it to print:</p>
<pre><code> Imran has a score of 10
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do,</p>
<pre><code>class_score.write("{} has score {}".format(name, score))
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>print("{} has score {}".format(name, score), file=class_score)
</code></pre>
<p>This way you could do the following as well,</p>
<pre><code>print(*class_format, file=class_score)
</code></pre>
<p>I would prefer the 2nd one.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>class_format</code> should be:</p>
<pre><code>class_format = "{} has a score of {}".format(name, Score)
</code></pre>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow"><code>str.join</code></a> to build a string from the tuple.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, do you know how I would be able to search  if a user (the input the same name each time the program is run) has more than 3 scores? I'm guessing I could use the any() function but I'm not too sure. I just want to make sure that the program will delete the oldest score if there is 3 scores for a user</span>
