<p>I am trying to install flake8 package using pip3 and it seems that it refuses to install because is already installed in one local location. </p>
<p>How can I force it to install globally (system level)?</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install flake8
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): flake8 in ./.local/lib/python3.4/site-packages
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that I would prefer a generic solution (that should work on Debian, OS X maybe even Windows), one that should be used on any platform so I don't want to specify the destination myself.</p>
<p>For some weird reason it behaves like I already specified <code>--user</code> which in my case I didn't.</p>
<p>The only way I was able to install a package globally was to first remove it and install it again after this. Somehow it seems that pip (8.1.1) refuses to install a package globally if it exists locally.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: No virtual environments were used or harmed during the experiments.</p>

<p>Why don't you try <code>sudo</code> with the <code>H</code> flag? This should do the trick.</p>
<pre><code>sudo -H pip install flake8
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe <code>--force-reinstall</code> would work, otherwise <code>--ignore-installed</code> should do the trick.</p>

<p>Are you using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow"><code>virtualenv</code></a>? If yes, deactivate the virtualenv. If you are not using, it is already installed widely (system level). Try to upgrade package.</p>
<pre><code>pip install flake8 --upgrade
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>H</code> as in Hlobal?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>-H</code> as in <i>hey sudo, stop using my home directory. use your own <code>H</code>ome directory instead</i> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/43623102/">stackoverflow.com/a/43623102</a></span>
