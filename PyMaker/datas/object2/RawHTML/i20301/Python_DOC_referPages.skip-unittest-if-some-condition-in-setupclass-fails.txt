<p>I was playing with <code>pyUnit</code> framework for unittest testing of my application. Is there any any way to skip all the tests in class if certain condition in setUpClass fails? </p>
<p>Currently, I am setting up environment (creating resources, configuring global settings) in setUpClass. But, if any of these resource creation fails..I am raising exception. Instead of that I want to skip the whole test suite.</p>

<p>Got the answer:</p>
<p>For those who gets stuck here-</p>
<p>unittest can be skipped from setUpClass in following way-</p>
<pre><code>raise unittest.SkipTest(message)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of explicitly raising the SkipTest exception, the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#skipping-tests-and-expected-failures" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> suggests using TestCase.skipTest(). For example:</p>
<pre><code>def setUp(self):
    if skip_tests_flag:
        self.skipTest('skipped test due to skip_tests_flag')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Here is the doc <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html#skipping-tests-and-expected-failures" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/library/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can also raise this from the tests themselves if they determine they shouldn't be run for whatever reason.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there a way we can skip it without raising exception? I want to see 0 exception and 0 failures when we skip it in setupclass. This method shows exception in the run results.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes, but you spend additional time in setUpClass and setUp methods for the test which you are going to skip</span>
