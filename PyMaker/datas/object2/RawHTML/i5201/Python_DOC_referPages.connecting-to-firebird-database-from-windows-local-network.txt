<p>I have been writing a small Python app for several weeks. The application reads data from a Firebird database and it copies it to another DB. I'm using FDB with Firebird embedded.<br/><br/>This is my connection code.</p>
<pre><code>def createConnectionTo(path):
    try:
        connection = fdb.connect(
            database=path,
            user='SYSDBA',
            password='masterkey',
            charset='WIN1252'
        )
        print("Connessione al database riuscita!\n")
        return connection
    except fdb.fbcore.DatabaseError as details:
        errorMsg = "ERRORE: impossibile connettersi al database!\nPer favore scegliere un altro file.\n\nDETTAGLI\n"+str(details).replace("\\n", "\n")+"\n"
        print(errorMsg)
        return False
    except fdb.fbcore.ProgrammingError as details:
        errorMsg = "ERROR: bad parameters value!\nPlease check your connection code.\nDETAILS: "+str(details)+"\n"
        print(errorMsg)
        return False
    except Exception as errorMsg:
        print("ERRORE: "+str(errorMsg))
        input("Premi un ENTER per chiudere la finestra.")
        return -1

<p>This code works for folders inside my computer, but inexplicably it doesn't work for folders shared in our local network. I used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html?highlight=os%20path%20exists#os.path.exists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">os.path.exists()</a> to check whetever Python was able to find the selected shared folders and it always returned True.<br/><br/>I keep getting this error and I don't have any clue how to solve it, even if I suspect that it is somewhat related to a slash conversion issue.</p>
<pre><code>('Error while connecting to database:
- SQLCODE: -902
- I/O error during "CreateFile (open)" operation for file "Danea Easyfatt\\ANYMA 2017 dal 06-02-17.eft"
- Error while trying to open file
- Impossibile trovare il percorso specificato. ', -902, 335544344)
</code></pre>
<p>I tried all the following way to type the path:</p>
<ul>
<li>\\CENTRALE\Danea Easyfatt\ANYMA 2017 dal 06-02-17.eft</li>
<li>//CENTRALE/Danea Easyfatt/ANYMA 2017 dal 06-02-17.eft</li>
<li>\\\CENTRALE\\Danea Easyfatt\\ANYMA 2017 dal 06-02-17.eft</li>
</ul>
<p>None of them worked.</p>

<p>You cannot access databases on a network share. Firebird explicitly disallows this<sup>*</sup>. However, as far as I can tell, the error you display simply means you're trying to use an invalid path to access file.</p>
<p>If you want to connect to a Firebird database over a network, you should connect to a Firebird server on the system hosting the database. That means running Firebird server, not using Firebird Embedded.</p>
<p><sup>* : You can configure Firebird to allow opening database on a network drive, but it is a great way to corrupt a database if multiple processes try to modify the database from different hosts, it is something you really should not do.</sup></p>

<span class="comment-copy">your error shows file name ending with .EFT - why do you think that file type is Firebird database ??? <a href="https://www.solvusoft.com/en/file-extensions/file-extension-eft/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">solvusoft.com/en/file-extensions/file-extension-eft</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Arioch'The in this case EFT stands for Easyfatt, the management software used in the company where I work. The software house responsabile for Easyfatt assured me that it is just a renamed Firebird database.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now, show please the database connection string ( the path variable, probably ) as you constructed it before <code>fdb.connect</code> call. As of the error text suggest not the network path, but instead the subfolder in the "current working directory" of your application. If you would set SysInternals Process Monitor to monitor your application you would probably see where it really tries to open the database file - and it is NOT a network share most probably.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure why you added those paths in your edit just now. All of those are network share paths, but in this case, it looks like you may have actually connected to a Firebird server on the machine <code>CENTRALE</code> (using Firebird's XNET protocol), but instructed it to connect to the local filesystem file with relative path <code>Danea Easyfatt\ANYMA 2017 dal 06-02-17.eft</code>, which doesn't exist from the perspective of the local file system.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The XNET protocol uses a connection string that looks like a UNC path if used with a relative path or an alias.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where can I find the docs on connecting to the Firebird server on the system hosting the database? Thank you very much. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@matteobin Just consult the fdb documentation, eg the <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/fdb/getting-started.html#quick-start-guide" rel="nofollow noreferrer">quick-start</a> shows how to connect to a remote host.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did that, but I'm not able to connect to my server. I get the "Unable to complete network request to host" error. Oh well, I'll work on something else and I will come back to this issue later. Thank you very much for now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@matteobin Then either there is no Firebird server running, it's running on a different port than the default, or it only allows connections from localhost (either by its own config or through a firewall config).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, @matteobin , how did it end that firebird database file is available on the network shared folder ? Was it your deed, or are those software vendors who did it ? Cause it is bad for both security and data integrity - sharing the database file provides for copying it away, and the copy would lack any security and potentially lack half of data. It is kind of rather wrong setup!</span>
