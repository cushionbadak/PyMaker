<p>Let's say I have two processes: a reader and a writer. How does the writer detect when the reader has finished writing values?</p>
<p>The <code>multiprocessing</code> module has <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Queue.close" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a queue with a close method</a> that seems custom-built for this purpose. But how do you detect when the queue has been closed?</p>
<p>This doesn't seem to work, as the writer never exits:</p>
<pre><code>import multiprocessing as mp

def getter(q):
    while True:
        try:
            print(q.get())
        except Exception:
            break

def putter(q):
    q.put(1)
    q.put(2)
    q.close()

q = mp.Queue()
writer = mp.Process(target=putter, args=(q, ))
reader = mp.Process(target=getter, args=(q, ))
reader.start()
writer.start()

writer.join()
reader.join()
</code></pre>
<p>Should the reader-writer pair use a sentinel value to signal end of writing? Then what's the point of having the <code>close</code> method?</p>
<p>EDIT: While <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3605188/communicating-end-of-queue">this question</a> asks about the Queue module (now <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">queue</a>), I am asking specifically about <code>mp.Queue</code> and what the correct use of the <code>.close</code> method is.</p>

<p>You don't. That is not the purpose of <code>close</code>. Calling <code>close</code> doesn't even guarantee that no more items will be added to the queue; the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Queue.close" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Indicate that no more data will be put on this queue <strong>by the current process</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>close</code> is intended to shut down the current process's feeder thread for that queue (or at least start shutting it down), not to communicate an end-of-queue to other processes.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you want to signal that no more values will be written to the queue, use standard techniques like enqueueing a sentinel object, like you would with an ordinary <code>queue.Queue</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@Turn I'm specifically asking about <code>mp.Queue</code> which has a <code>.close</code> method. I know that this question has been asked previously about the <code>queue</code> module (formerly Queue in python 2), but both the implementation and the interfaces for these modules differ.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fair enough, I retracted the vote.</span>
