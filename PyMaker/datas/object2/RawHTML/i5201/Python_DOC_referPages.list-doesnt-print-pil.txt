<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I wrote a very simple program, and something that has no reason for it not to work.  It isn't working. This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>from PIL import Image

image = Image.open("0.png", 'r')

width, height = image.size
data = list(image.getdata()))
print(data)
</code></pre>
<p>The data never prints. No errors occur; nothing happens.</p>
<p>I have tried putting a print statement in between the <code>getdata()</code> command and <code>print(data)</code> command. The string prints, but the list still doesn't.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>On this line: <code>data = list(image.getdata()))</code> you have one <code>)</code> too many.</p>
<p>For some reason this doesn't work when running through the IDLE, however if you run this through a terminal it will start printing the values. </p>
<p>I am guessing that PIL requires some function that is provided by the terminal and since the IDLE is not actually a terminal it cannot execute. </p>
<p>You may also want to add a <code>input()</code> to the end of your script to prevent the window from closing.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">do the width and height print?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PaulH yes. Width + height print.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried stepping through with a debugger? Run your script with <code>python -m pdb your_script.py</code> and step through to the line which gets you the data. You can inspect the variable / behaviour from there. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html</a> for usage details for pdb.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@viraptor I tried that when printing random things every time a line goes. Everything works as expected up to the one line.</span>
