<p>So I'm working on a project at school and I'm wondering how to make certain strings repeat. As an example, I made a small piece of code that has a string to that could be repeated. How do I repeat the string "loading..."? (Obviously, half the code is missing as this is just an example!)</p>
<pre><code>import sys
import time
print("Welcome to the loading screen of every game!!!")
yesNo = input("Do you want to continue(Y or N): ").upper()
if yesNo == "Y":
    print("Loading...")
    time.sleep(10)

sys.exit()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use a loop.</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(5):
    print("Loading...")
    time.sleep(10)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Can you define what you mean by "repeat"? If I understand the meaning of your code snippet correctly, you want "Loading..." to keep printing as long as the user is entering a "Y"?</p>
<p>This is a great use for a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/WhileLoop" rel="nofollow noreferrer">while loop</a>! I would recommend putting it into an infinite loop (<code>while True</code>) and then <code>break</code> out when a certain condition has been satisfied.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could either use a <code>while</code> statement or <code>for</code> statement.</p>
<p>Also I would assume you would only want it to do this for a certain amount of time and not infinitely in which case <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>range()</code></a> might also be useful.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: using <code>for</code>:</strong></p>
<pre><code>for i in range(5):
    print("Loading...")
    time.sleep(10)
</code></pre>
<p>This output would be: </p>
<pre><code>Loading...
Loading...
Loading...
Loading...
Loading...
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Method 2:  using <code>while</code>:</strong></p>
<pre><code> i = 5
 while i &lt; 5:
     print("Loading...")
     time.sleep(10)
     i = i + 1
</code></pre>
<p>This output will be:</p>
<pre><code>Loading...
Loading...
Loading...
Loading...
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Method 3: infinite looping:</strong></p>
<pre><code> while True:
     print("Loading...")
     time.sleep(10)
</code></pre>
<p>This will keep printing "Loading..." forever.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you want it to repeat, using a loop would be a good start.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ThankYou! Its just small things like that which I forget</span>
