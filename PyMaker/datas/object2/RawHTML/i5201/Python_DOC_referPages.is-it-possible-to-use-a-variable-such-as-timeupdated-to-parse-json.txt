<p>Ok, json_tree is a variable that contains something that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>    json_tree = "['time']['updated']"
</code></pre>
<p>Can you pass it as a variable....</p>
<pre><code>    hdr = { 'User-Agent' : 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64)' }
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers=hdr)
    readdata = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
    json_data = readdata.read()
    json_dict = json.loads(json_data)
</code></pre>
<p>like so??</p>
<pre><code>    print(json_dict[json_tree])
</code></pre>
<p>My purpose is to pass one of many json_tree values from a .ini into the class that contains the above code. 
If this is a bad plan, what could work, instead?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>This is a use case for <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonpath-rw" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>jsonpath</code></a>, in which syntax one would use the expression <code>time.updated</code> to refer to the value in question.</p>
<pre><code>json_expr = "time.updated"
json_dict = {"time": {"updated": "2018-01-05"}}

from jsonpath_rw import parse as parse_jsonpath

results = parse_jsonpath(json_expr).find(json_dict)
if len(results) == 0:
  raise Exception("Could not find any matches for %r in %r" % (json_expr, json_dict))
elif len(results) &gt; 1:
  raise Exception("Expression %r had more than one match; cannot use for configuration" % (json_expr,))

result = results[0].value

<span class="comment-copy">What is the value of <code>json_data</code>? (And no, you cannot evaluate <code>json_dict[json_tree]</code>, unless <code>json_dict</code> has the key <code>"['time']['updated']"</code>, verbatim.)</span>

<span class="comment-copy">BTW, wherever possible, a question title instead of saying "this" should have a description of what "this" is, so someone can tell what you're asking without having to click through to the full question text. I've tried to edit towards that end here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Charles - I wanted to do that, but couldn't remember what "this" was. but, it was key values. haha. Thank you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">DYZ - can you extrapolate on what you mean by "verbatim" in that sentence? Sorry for being obtuse.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, sweet. As I am a python noob, I had no idea about jsonpath. Going to use this guy. Thank you for the clean solution!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just realized this is basically xpath for Python. Pretty great.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hey, I have an implementation question...         json_dict = json.loads(json_data)         results = parse_jsonpath(self.json_key).find(json_dict)         print(results)   coindesk = Price("coindesk","<a href='https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json","bpi.usd"' rel="nofollow noreferrer">api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/…</a>)  When I run the program, it sends me empty brackets: [] in return. I know I'm referencing the right json keys.... a bit confused about jsonpath</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could you ask a new question with a complete <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a> for that failure mode?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I created a new question, that is more comprehensive and as minimal as possible, here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48629461/python-jsonpath-how-do-i-parse-with-jsonpath-correctly" title="python jsonpath how do i parse with jsonpath correctly">stackoverflow.com/questions/48629461/…</a>  I appreciate any help you can offer.
