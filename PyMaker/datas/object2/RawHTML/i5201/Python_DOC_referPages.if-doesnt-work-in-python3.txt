<p>I am making a program that helps with things, such as math
but something is weird. When I type "help me with math", it does nothing and
just says "i don't know". this is python 3.6 on windows.
something is weird.</p>
<pre><code>import pymsgbox
def alert(text='',title='',timeout=None):
    pymsgbox.alert(text=text,title=title,timeout=timeout)
def prompt(text='',title='',timeout=None):
    pymsgbox.prompt(text=text,title=title,timeout=timeout)
def math():
    eq=prompt("do you need an equation done?(y,n)")

    eqat=str(prompt(text="enter the equation:"))
    e=eval(eqat)
    alert(text="the awnser is: "+str(e))
prompts={"i dom't know.":"Well, i have nothing to do for you!",}
while True:
    alert(text="this is an helper for stuff.",title="helper")
    inp =prompt(text="how can i help you?",title="helper")
    if inp=="Help me with math":
        math()

        anwser=prompts[inp]

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should type "Help me with math" instead of "help me with math". 
Those are different strings, letter case matters.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">what you are typing doesn't appear to have a capital H</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You even state in your problem description that you don't write the same string you check for</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, <code>alert(text=prompts.get(inp, 'i don't know how to help you.'))</code> would help solve the typo in the variable name and remove 4 lines of code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">An aside, there is no tax applied to the number of lines in your script or spaces. Please look up PEP8 and space your code out to make it more legible.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're giving the wrong awnser(sic!).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and if you dont want case to matter, try <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.lower()</a></span>
