<p>How can I make a list similar to dictionary ?
When I have a text below </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientists hope facial recognition may help with their
  understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to make a distribution list. For example in this case, every each words appear once, then I am thinking the list should be </p>
<pre><code>[(('the'), 1),
(('scientists'), 1), 
(('hope'), 1),........]
</code></pre>
<p>I also suppose to make distribution graph based on those list.
Is there any other better way in this case?
It would be really appreciated if you explained in detail.</p>

<p>I don't know why you would want to use a list here, a dictionary would be easier to make and access. Even better, a <code>collections.Counter</code> could be built directly from a list of words like so:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

words = ["the", "scientists", ...]

word_counter = Counter(words) # a subclass of dict

# word_list = list(word_counter.items()) # this would convert it to a list of tuples
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to preserve order, you could use a dictionary of indices into the list:</p>
<pre><code>words = ["the", "scientists", ...]

counts = []
indices = {}
for word in words:
  if word in indices:
    counts[word][1] += 1
  else:
    indices[word] = len(counts)
    counts.append([word, 1])
</code></pre>
<p>You could also just search the list for the right index, but this is faster.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why not just use a dictionary? If you do you can convert to a list with <code>list(dict.items())</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@internet_user: Dictionaries don't preserve order, which could be a very good reason not to do that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@martineau if that's important you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>OrderedDict</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Mark: True, of course...but that's not what internet_user suggested.</span>
