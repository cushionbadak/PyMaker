<p>I am new to python and jupyter notebook. When creating a table, a syntax error keeps popping up, it seems that python cannot recognize the pipe character (|). Can anyone help me? Many thanks!</p>
<pre><code>| This | is   |
|------|------|
|   a  | table|
</code></pre>
<p>I am using a MAC and there is a pipe character on the keyboard.

<p>Actually python doesnÂ´t store data in tables. But you can store data you need in e.g. list and then use module texttable to output a table.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I hate to say it : it all depends on context. You should show us your code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should probably read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Python tutorial</a> or some other introductory material.  The pipe character <code>|</code> has meaning in python, but it's not for building tables (python doesn't really have a concept of a table).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks so much @PatrickHaugh. I''ll have a look at the documents.</span>
