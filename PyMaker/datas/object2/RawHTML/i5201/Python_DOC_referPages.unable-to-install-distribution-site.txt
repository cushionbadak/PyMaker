<p>For a course I am taking, I need to install the package(?) site into an Anaconda virtual environment. I was able to install the other requirements for the course using the command</p>
<pre><code>pip install 'somename==version'
</code></pre>
<p>However, when I ran</p>
<pre><code>pip install 'site==0.0.1'
</code></pre>
<p>I got the error message</p>
<pre><code>  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement site (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for site
</code></pre>
<p>The only information about site that I can find is (<a href="https://libraries.io/pypi/site" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://libraries.io/pypi/site</a>), but it does not really give much information.</p>
<p>I am using Anaconda 4.4.0 (x86_64) and Python 3.5.3.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>What's telling you that you need to install this module? Ignore it. It's wrong.</p>
