<p>I'm trying to figure out how to call either one function, or the other function based on user input after being asked a simple one or the other type question.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Of course. Here's a miniature example to get you started. This method, as opposed to an <code>if / else</code> construct, is known as function <em>dispatching</em>.</p>
<pre><code>def func1():
    return 'Function1 result'

def func2():
    return 'Function2 result'

def func3():
    return 'Function3 result'

def func_default():
    return 'Function default result'

d = {1: func1, 2: func2, 3: func3}

try:
    x = int(input('What function do you wish to run?'))   
    result = d.get(x, func_default)()
    print(result)

except ValueError:
    print('Please rerun and enter an integer.')

<span class="comment-copy">Yes, it's absolutely possible. Just use an <code>if</code>/<code>else</code>. Perhaps you've tried something and run into difficulty?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. Programming is all about making decisions like that. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@A.Wenn made a decent point (albeit that they posted an answer because they can't comment). This will always give <code>func_default()</code> in Python 3 because <code>input</code> returns a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@roganjosh, fair point. updated.</span>
