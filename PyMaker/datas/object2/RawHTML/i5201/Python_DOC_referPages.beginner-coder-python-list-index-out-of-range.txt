<p>I am new to coding and I have extracted data from the column of a table that look like this </p>
<pre><code>print(column3)

x; y
x; y
x 
x; y; z
x 
x; y
</code></pre>
<p>I then split the string by '; '</p>
<pre><code>column_elements = column3.split('; ')
print(column_elements)

['x', 'y']
['x', 'y']
['x'] 
['x', 'y', 'z']
['x'] 
['x', 'y']
</code></pre>
<p>so when I try to print using </p>
<pre><code>y = (column_elements[1]) 
</code></pre>
<p>I get an error due to not all the lists having a length longer than [0]. I am not 
sure how to get each of the elements from a dataset of varying list lengths.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do not use direct indexing, use <code>for</code> over the elements of the list:</p>
<pre><code>l = [[0],[1,2,3],[5,2]]

for elem in l:
    for num in elem:
        print(num)
</code></pre>
<p>or (not as good, not needed, never do this) use <code>len</code> to get the length of a inner list (starting at 0 up to len(l)-1 is the index):</p>
<pre><code>for idx in range(len(l)):            # len(l) == 3, range(len(l)) == [0,1,2]  
    for idx2 in range(len(l[idx])):     # len of the sublist
        print(l[idx][idx2])
</code></pre>
<p>Output (for both):</p>
<pre><code>0
1
2
3
5
2
</code></pre>
<p>If you really need the index alongsinde the value, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enumeration</a> and  decomposed index and value:</p>
<pre><code>for idx, val in enumerate(l):   # yields you (0,[0]), (1,[1,2,3]), (2,[5,2])
    print(f"Index: {idx} with {val}")
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Index: 0 with [0]
Index: 1 with [1, 2, 3]
Index: 2 with [5, 2] 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What exactly is your expected output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you aware that python uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zero-based indexing</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@pault I believe so. Notice he said: <i>"I get an error due to not all the lists having a length longer <b>than [0]</b>"</i>. Of course, his terminology is off, but I believe he's trying to say you can only accesses the first element of some of his sublist, which implies that the list has a length of one.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChristianDean I also saw that but I wasn't sure. I posted the link because OP said they were a beginner. Didn't mean to come off as sarcastic if that's what you thought- like my profile pic says, I like to think positive.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@pault It's fine man. I didn't think you were being sarcastic at all :-) I agree, this OP isn't exactly clear. I was just offering my two-cents.</span>
