Thanks in Advance</p>

<p>The <code>input()</code> function returns a value, but you haven't used it. Your statement</p>
<pre><code>if 2:
</code></pre>
<p>is always true (because <code>2</code> is not zero). Here is where you would use the return value returned by <code>input()</code> from the previous statement. Use something like:</p>
<pre><code>choice = int(input("..."))
if choice == 2:
    # ...

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The right side of an <code>if</code> statement is evaluated. So when you write </p>
<pre><code>if 2:
</code></pre>
<p>The computer converts this to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type" rel="nofollow noreferrer">boolean</a> value (either True or alse). For integers, all numbers but 0 are converted to True, so this code always runs.</p>
<p>Use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers" rel="nofollow noreferrer">variable</a> to store the result of <code>input</code>, and compare that to 2:</p>
<pre><code>answer = int(input("Whould you like to convert to AUD or AUD to another Currency?
    \nConvert to AUD\nConvert From AUD"))

if answer == 2:

<span class="comment-copy"><code>if 2:</code> and <code>if 1:</code> are always true. There is <i>no comparison here</i>. You appear to have forgotten to assign the result of the <code>int(input(...))</code> call to compare that result.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks , Im still a llittle confused. Could you give me an example</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh right. Thanks very usefull</span>
