<p>I was trying to make the string <code>HELLO</code> to <code>OHELL</code> in Python. But couldn't get any way to rotate it without working with loops. How to code for it in just 1-2 lines so that I could get the desired pattern?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can slice and add strings:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'HELLO'
&gt;&gt;&gt; s[-1] + s[:-1]
'OHELL'
</code></pre>
<p>This gives you the last character:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s[-1]
'O'
</code></pre>
<p>and this everything but the last:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s[:-1]
'HELL'
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, add them with <code>+</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is one way:</p>
<pre><code>def rotate(strg, n):
    return strg[n:] + strg[:n]

rotate('HELLO', -1)  # 'OHELL'
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.deque</code></a> ("double-ended queue") is optimised for queue-related operations. It has a dedicated rotate() method:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import deque

items = deque('HELLO')
items.rotate(1)

''.join(items)  # 'OHELL'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would agree with Mike MÃ¼ller's answer:</p>
<pre><code>s = 'HELLO'
s = s[-1] + s[:-1]
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to share another way of looking at <code>s[:-1]</code></p>
<pre><code>s[0:-1]
</code></pre>
<p>This means that it is starting from the start and including everything except for s[-1].
I hope this helped.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think <i>reverse</i> is the wrong term here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user8880799, did one of the below solutions help? feel free to accept an answer (tick on left), or comment, so others with the same problem can find a tested solution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How should I do if the list is numbers? because I got error : unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'list'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is for strings. Maybe you men a list of numbers <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>? <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; L = [1, 2, 3] &gt;&gt;&gt; L[-1:] + L[:-1] [3, 1, 2]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes , like what you have written</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I like that answer because it also works with empty strings.</span>
