<p>I have this JSON file where the amount of id's sometimes changes (more id's will be added):</p>
<pre><code>{
    "maps": [
        {
            "id": "blabla1",
            "iscategorical": "0"
        },
        {
            "id": "blabla2",
            "iscategorical": "0"
        },
        {
            "id": "blabla3",
            "iscategorical": "0"
        },
        {
            "id": "blabla4",
            "iscategorical": "0"
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>I have this python code that has to print all the values of ids:</p>
<pre><code>import json

data = json.load(open('data.json'))
variable1 = data["maps"][0]["id"]
print(variable1)
variable2 = data["maps"][1]["id"]
print(variable2)
variable3 = data["maps"][2]["id"]
print(variable3)
variable4 = data["maps"][3]["id"]
print(variable4)
</code></pre>
<p>I have to use variables, because i want to show the values in a dropdown menu. Is it possible to save the values of the id's in a more efficient way? How do you know the max amount of id's of this json file (in de example 4)?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>data['maps']</code> is a simple list, so you can iterate over it as such:</p>
<pre><code>for map in data['maps']:
    print(map['id'])
</code></pre>
<p>To store them in a variable, you'll need to output them to a list.  Storing them each in a separate variable is not a good idea, because like you said, you don't have a way to know how many there are.</p>
<pre><code>ids = []
for map in data['maps']:
    ids.append(map['id'])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can get the number of <code>id</code> (which is the number of elements) by checking the <code>length</code> of <code>data['maps']</code>:</p>
<pre><code>number_of_ids = len(data['maps'])
</code></pre>
<p>A clean way to get all the <code>id</code> values is storing them in a <code>list</code>. </p>
<p>You can achieve this in a pythonic way like this:</p>
<pre><code>list_of_ids = [map['id'] for map in data['maps']]
</code></pre>
<p>Using this approach you don't even need to store the number of elements in the original <code>json</code>, because you iterate through all of them using a <code>foreach</code> approach, essentially.</p>
<p>If the pythonic approach troubles you, you can achieve the same thing with a classic <code>foreach</code> approach doing so:</p>
<pre><code>list_of_ids = []
for map in data['maps']:
    list_of_ids.append(map['id'])
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can do with a <strong>classic</strong> <code>for loop</code>, and here is where you really need the length:</p>
<pre><code>number_of_ids = len(data['maps'])
list_of_ids = []
for i in range(0,number_of_ids):
    list_of_ids.append(data['maps'][i]['id'])
</code></pre>
<p>This last is the classic way, but I suggest you to take the others approaches in order to leverage the advantages python offers to you!</p>
<p>You can find more on this stuff <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>!</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can have the values of the ID in a tuple or a list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't store them in variables, store them in a list. A list knows its length also.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The OP also asked how many IDs were in the list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Because of the dropdown menu I want to make, I have to store them in variables. Here I'm stuck. This example is a good way to start</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How are you creating the "dropdown"?  I can't help more without seeing your code for that, or at least what framework.  Please update your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I used a list for the dropdown. Thank you for changing the post with a list! OptionMenu(root, self.dropBoard, *ids).grid(row=0, column=0)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The poster is having trouble with the concept of a <code>for</code> loop.  For now, suggesting list comprehensions to them is too much, in my opinion.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Mh, allright, I'm going to add the common way too!</span>
