<p>I've bumped into a simple snake game code and wanted to check if it will work.</p>
<p>Here is the error I get:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Windows version of Python doesn’t include the curses module. A
  ported version called UniCurses is available. You could also try the
  Console module written by Fredrik Lundh, which doesn’t use the same
  API as curses but provides cursor-addressable text output and full
  support for mouse and keyboard input.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Please edit the title to reflect the error you're receiving. Seems like your problem has everything to do with your system setup (curses is a system library) and nothing to do with the 'snake game'. This will help others when they run into the same problem.</span>
