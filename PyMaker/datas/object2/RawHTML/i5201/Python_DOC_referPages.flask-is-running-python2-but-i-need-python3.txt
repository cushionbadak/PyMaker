<p>I'm using Kali Linux. I wanted to make the default version of python to python3. Now it is python2. Both version(python2.7 &amp; python3.6) is already installed.</p>
<p>I couldn't find a way to do this. I ended up searching when someone said I shouldn't change the default version</p>
<p>I figured out flask isn't running python 3.6+ cause it couldn't recognize f-strings which was introduced in python 3.6. I thought maybe changing the default version of python can help me. Now I'm confused. </p>
<p>I want to run flask apps with python 3.6+ or the latest versions. How do I do it? I ran into some of the similar questions but those couldn't help.</p>

<p>Just use <code>pip</code> with Pyhton 3:</p>
<pre><code>sudo python3 -m pip install flask
</code></pre>
<p>It will do the job for the rightful version of Python.</p>
<p>And always invoke your script with <code>python3</code> to be sure you are using the proper version. You can also check with <code>which</code> command to understand what binary will be executed when invoking in shell:</p>
<pre><code>jlandercy@themis:~$ which python
/usr/bin/python
jlandercy@themis:~$ which python3
/usr/bin/python3
</code></pre>
<p>Or create an <a href="https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-change-from-default-to-alternative-python-version-on-debian-linux" rel="nofollow noreferrer">alias</a> to python3 if you find it easier, then <code>which</code> will respond accordingly.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes. That would be good. But I wanted to know how to do it without of virtualization. @RayToal</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShashankSingh python 3.6 is already installed by default.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>python3 file.py</code> instead of <code>python file.py</code></span>
