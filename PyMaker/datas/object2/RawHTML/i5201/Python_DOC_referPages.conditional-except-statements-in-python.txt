<p>Is there a way to make an except statement conditional - in other words, only catch a type of exception if the condition is true? This is the idea I have, but it seems like it won't work</p>
<pre><code>try:
  &lt;code&gt;
if condition == True:
  except Exception as e:
    &lt;error handling&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>No, you can't do that. What you can do is catch the error then check the condition inside the except block and re-raise if necessary:</p>
<pre><code>except Exception as e:
    if not condition:
        raise
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Not like that, but I find this to be the cleanest solution</p>
<pre><code>try:
  &lt;code&gt;
except Exception as e:
    if condition:
        &lt;error handling&gt;
    else:
        raise  # re raises the exception
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use different exceptions for each case and catch them seperately:</p>
<pre><code>import random


class myException_1(Exception):

    pass

class myException_2(Exception):
    pass


try:
    a = random.randint(0,10)
    if a % 2 == 0:
        raise myException_1("something happened")
    elif a % 3 ==0:
        raise myException_2("something else happened")
    else:
        print("we made it!")
except myException_2 as e:
    print("a was divisible by 3")
    print(e)
except myException_1 as e:
    print("a was divisible by 2")
    print(e)
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">You don't need the <code>e</code> after <code>raise</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I left this out actually - the problem is that the exception I'm catching may not have been imported. So is there a way to only catch an exception type if that type exists?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you have an exception object, it's type DOES exist, by definition. The fact it has not been imported in your current module is another issue, and is easy to solve: just import it. If your question is "how do I only catch exceptions of a specific type" then it's documented: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Iâ€™m not sure what conditional <i>throwing</i> has to do with the question.</span>
