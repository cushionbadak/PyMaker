<p>When I am passing the single period, I am able to execute but trying to pass multiple values using IN clause, not able to do?</p>
<p>Problem is taking string and in list format. But my period accept only integer like <code>201801,201802</code> etc.  How to pass the parameter value? Any trick to handle list and convert into integer and pass into query? Since when passing through unix shell file it convert the params into python list? </p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>join()</code></a> to get the list as a string like:</p>
<pre><code>period_param_from_list = ','.join(str(x) for x in a_list)
</code></pre>
<h3>Test Code:</h3>
<pre><code>period_param = '201801,201802,201803'
a_list = [int(x) for x in period_param.split(',')]
period_param_from_list = ','.join(str(x) for x in a_list)

print(a_list)
print(period_param_from_list)
</code></pre>
<h3>Result:</h3>
<pre><code>[201801, 201802, 201803]
201801,201802,201803
</code></pre>
<h3>As A Query</h3>
<pre><code>period_param = [201801, 201802, 201803]
rows = session.execute(
    """select * from table where id =%s and period in (%s)""",
    (id_param, ','.join(str(x) for x in period_param)))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks ,but this will convert into string that will be not accepted as parameter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You were not clear exactly what you expected the query string to look like.  I looked at what you were doing and made an assumption.  I should not have.  If this is not what you need, please clarify your question.</span>
