<p>I am trying to create a virtual environment as:</p>
<pre><code>python3.6 -m venv env
Error: Command '['/Users/jonathan/temp/django-example-channels/env/bin/python3.6', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1.
</code></pre>
<p>My googling on the problem brings up many similar cases but all say they are on Ubuntu and Ubuntu related. Me I am on a Mac so I am thinking this is something else?</p>
<p>Don't really know what would be helpful but here is version information at least:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3.6 --version
Python 3.6.0 :: Anaconda 4.3.1 (x86_64)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So, it seems Anaconda was the problem. First virtualenv needed to be installed:</p>
<p><code>conda install virtualenv</code> </p>
<p>I actually had to ru nthat multiple times before I got: <code># All requested packages already installed.</code>. Don't know what's up with that, maybe my conda was to unupdated...</p>
<p>Then it still didn't work to create an environment as:</p>
<pre><code>$ python3.6 -m venv env
Error: Command '['/Users/jonathan/temp/django-example-channels/env/bin/python3.6', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1.
</code></pre>
<p>However <code>$ python3.6 -m venv env</code> actually seems to have worked.</p>

In general though, I don't think you need to include the <code>.6</code> in command. Just using <code>$ python3 -m venv path/to/virtual/env</code> should work, as shown in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official docs</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">The recomended way to create a venv with a specific python version is <code>virtualenv env -p python3.6</code>, does that fail as well?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"-bash: virtualenv: command not found", interesting... :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using virtualenv requires that the virtualenv package first be installed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The module <code>venv</code> is part of Python 3.6's standard library but conda recommends to use their own virtual environment system <a href="https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The packaging of anaconda might have removed the venv package and if you want to install it, use <code>conda install virtualenv</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is no need to include it, but if he has multiple python versions that is how you'd want to discern between them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/305" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/305</a> indicates that Anaconda is not compatible with the virtualenv one get from pip install</span>
