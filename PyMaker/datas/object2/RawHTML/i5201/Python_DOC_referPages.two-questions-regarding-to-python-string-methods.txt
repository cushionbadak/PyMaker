<p>As I reviewing the standard library today, I found two questions that I did not notice before:</p>
<p><strong>1. What is the difference between <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.capitalize" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.capitalize()</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.title" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.title()</code></a>?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>str.capitalize()</code>: Return a copy of the string with its first
  character capitalized and the rest lowercased.</p>
<p><code>str.title()</code>: Return a titlecased version of the string where words
  start with an uppercase character and the remaining characters are
  lowercase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't find them to be much different? And according to the python spirit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do
  it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NEVERMIND, I got it:</strong></p>
<pre><code>print('hello world!'.title())        # Hello World
print('hello world!'.capitalize())   # Hello world
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Capitalize() will not put capital on the second word of the string contains more than one word.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.swapcase" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.swapcase()</code></a>, in the document it mentioned:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that it is not necessarily true that s.swapcase().swapcase() ==
  s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can somebody give an example? I couldn't think of any.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>capitalize</code> only changes the first letter.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "hello I'm here"
&gt;&gt;&gt; s.capitalize()
"Hello i'm here"
</code></pre>
<p><code>title</code> changes the letters of each word</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s.title()
"Hello I'M Here"
</code></pre>
<p>Ok that we could have known by reading the manual. Now the <em>really</em> interesting part of your question:</p>
<p><code>swapcase</code> performs a <code>casefold</code> (which is slightly smarter than <code>lower</code>) which cannot be undone in some cases (german double-s/<code>ß</code> letter for instance):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "ß".swapcase().swapcase()
'ss'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could have easily found the answer to this one if you had tried little harder, but here you go.</p>
<p><code>str.capitalize</code> only capitalizes the first character in a line.</p>
<p><code>str.title</code> capitalizes first character of all the words in a string.</p>
<p><code>str.swapcase</code>, well, swapcase of all the characters in the string.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'asia is A continent'.capitalize
'Asia is A continent'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'asia is A continent'.title()
'Asia Is A Continent'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'asia is A continent'.swapcase()
'ASIA IS a CONTINENT'
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The description is clear, and a little experimenting would show the difference. With capitalize it is only the first letter that is capitalised, not the first letter of <i>each word</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For <code>swapcase</code> they are probably talking about the inclusion of unicode, foreign, characters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndyG Yes, I found that later, but what about the 2nd question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great guys, all clear, I will just delete this question, and I just found out that I couldn't :(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't even know how did you type that 'beta' out?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't, I pasted it from a wiki page :) but Germans probably have that handy on their keyboard.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can also hold <code>Alt</code> and press 225 on the numeric keypad.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ßßß no that doesn't work :) excellent!!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndyG Doesn't seem to work for me?</span>
