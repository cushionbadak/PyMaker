<p>I'm looking for a way to parse arguments that look something like <code>test -t 5 -m hello</code> or <code>test --time 5 --message hello</code>. I've done some research and found out about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">argparse</a>, but as far as I know, this module only accepts command line arguments. I, however, want it to parse the arguments in the same way, but instead they are stored inside a string. </p>
<p>Does anybody of you know of a way to do this?</p>

<p>You can use the <code>argparse</code> module and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#the-parse-args-method" rel="nofollow noreferrer">explicitly pass arguments</a> to <code>parse_args()</code>. You will first split your string into individual arguments with <code>shlex.split()</code>.</p>

<p>You just need to take a look at the  <code>argparse</code> module, which do what you are looking for.</p>
<p>If you are using python &lt; 3.2, then the module is <code>optparse</code>, which is then  deprecated from newwer versions  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">what is your desired result? <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html?highlight=shlex#module-shlex" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>shlex</code></a> can split such strings...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Consider having whatever generates the string generate a list instead, so that you don't have to rely on <code>shlex</code> to parse it for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The string is generated by a library that is unable to output as a list, so I'll have to parse it myself</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>.split()</code> won't deal with quoted and escaped spaces.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Barmar Fair enough. But <code>shlex.split()</code> will.</span>
