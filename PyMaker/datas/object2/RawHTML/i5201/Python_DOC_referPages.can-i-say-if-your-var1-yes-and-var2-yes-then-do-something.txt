<p>The following program should help predicting your future Job via a few nested <code>if</code>-statements.</p>
<pre><code>print("This app will predict which job suits you best")
ComputerProgramer = input("Are you good at coding. A)Yes. B)No. [A/B]")
if ComputerProgramer == "A":
    ComputerProgramer = "Yes"

        print("Computer Programer")
    else :
        print("Architect")

    Architict = "no"

<p>Can you please help me find a replacement for this: 
<code>elif Architect == "Yes", ComputerProgramer == "Yes" :</code> ?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, you can use <code>and</code>. Your code could then look like this:</p>
<pre><code>computerProgramer = input("Are you good at coding. A)Yes. B)No [A/B]")
if computerProgramer == "A":
    computerProgramer = "Yes"

architect = input("Are you good at drawing. A)Yes . B)no. [A/B]")
if architect == "A":
    architect = "Yes"

if (architect == "Yes") and (computerProgramer == "Yes")  :
    finalAnswer = input("which one do you prefer? A)coding B)drawing [A/B]")
    if FinalAnswer == "A":
        print("Computer Programer")
    else :
        print("Architect")
</code></pre>
<p>Note: I changed your <code>elif</code> to a new <code>if</code>, since else would not have been excuteted after <code>"A"</code> as answer. (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer">may read this</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, as Chris_Rands suggested, in this case you can simplify the if-statement with: <code>if architect == computerProgramer == "Yes": ...</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>Architect == ComputerProgramer == "Yes" </code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>and</code> instead of <code>,</code>. Also, the condition <code>elif Architect == "Yes", ComputerProgramer == "Yes"  :</code> can <i>never</i> be true, as the <code>elif</code> is only checked if the user did not enter <code>"A"</code>. Also, why not have the user enter <code>"yes"</code> or <code>"no"</code> in the first place? Also, better use boolean <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> instead of <code>"yes"</code> and <code>"no"</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">either what @Chris_Rands said or 'Architect == "Yes" and ComputerProgramer == "Yes' (for if you might have different checks you want to perform.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tobias_k <code>elif Architect == "Yes", ComputerProgramer == "Yes"</code> can never be <b><code>False</code></b>. it is always <code>True</code>, since all two-tuples are <code>True</code> (If it even was a valid syntax that is). This can be seen with <code>elif (Architect == "Yes", ComputerProgramer == "Yes")</code></span>
