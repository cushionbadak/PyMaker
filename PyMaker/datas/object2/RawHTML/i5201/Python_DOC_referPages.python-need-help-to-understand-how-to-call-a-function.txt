<p>I am new to programming, and trying out with a little Python3.</p>
<p>I have some trouble understanding the concept behind calling a function? having the defined the following function, what would be the proper way to call it?</p>
<pre><code>def string_length(mystring):
return len(mystring)
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in advance guys</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>def string_length(mystring):
    return len(mystring)

print(string_length('something'))
</code></pre>
<p>Like that</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>length = string_length('some_string')
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>length</code> is a variable that will store the output.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>string_length('hello')</code> for example</span>
<span class="comment-copy">first, your spacing is off. the second line needs to be indented 4 spaces. Second, you'd call it by calling it: "print string_length(this_string)"  or "sl = string_length('this')"</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python3/python_functions.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Start with tutorials to understand concepts.</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that <code>len</code> is itself a function that you are already calling</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You really need to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">read the Python tutorial</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks mate - what is the purpose of the 'mystring*? that could be anything typed in there, right? by doesn't seem to be used anywhere?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's just a variable that's used internally in the function you define. So yes it could be anything you want. If you say <code>x=5</code> and then <code>def some_func(fart)</code> and the call <code>some_func(x)</code>, this tells <code>some_func</code> that you want <code>fart</code> to be <code>5</code> in this case.</span>
