<p>Is the <a href="https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pefile</code></a> python module considered as an external module for python?</p>
<p>I am asking because I need to write a python script (without the use of external Python libraries) that parses Portable Executable (PE) header files (e.g. extracting the section names of a PE file).</p>

<p>What is the difference between a module and a library?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <em>library</em> is a collection of code intended to be used by other libraries and/or applications.  A library can be made up of many modules.</p>
<p>A <em>module</em> is an object that serves as an organizational unit of Python code. Modules have a namespace containing arbitrary Python objects.  Typically, a module is written in one .py file, but there are other ways to create modules.  A module might be a script, an app, or a library.</p>

<p>is "pefile" python module considered as an external module for python?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pefile/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pefile</code></a> module is a 3rd-party module.  It is not included in Python standard libraries.  You can get the module by installing an external distribution, which you usually download from PyPI (the Python package index) using <code>pip</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can find all of the standard library modules <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I also just checked and it wasn't included in Anaconda, which is a really substantial distribution of Python. I think in all cases you would consider this "external".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you have any idea which standart library should i use for interfacing with PE files?(exe files)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@wim. I would argue that pefile is a library containing one module.</span>
