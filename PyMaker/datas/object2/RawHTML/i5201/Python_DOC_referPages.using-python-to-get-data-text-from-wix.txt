<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm making a python project in which I created a test wix website.
I want to get the data (text) from the wix website using urllib
so I did
url.urlopen(ADDRESS).readlines()
the problem is it did not give me anything from the text in the page and only information about the structure of the page in HTML.
how would I extricate the requested text information from the website?</p>

<p>I think you'll need to end up parsing the html for the information you want. Check out this python library:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html</a></p>
<p>You could potentially do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>from html.parser import HTMLParser
rel_data = []

class MyHTMLParser(HTMLParser):

    def handle_data(self, data):
         rel_data.append(data)


parser = MyHTMLParser()
parser.feed('&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;'
            '&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Parse me!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;')
print(rel_data)
</code></pre>
<p>Output</p>
<pre><code>["Test", "Parse me!"]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">say, it's giving me an error on the import, should i use from HTMLParser import HTMLParser instead?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah that will work. I should have specified that I'm using python 3. For python 2, the import is "from HTMLParser import HTMLParser."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok that seems to work now, but it's saying i'm giving 3 parameters instead of 2 in the MyHTMLParser class, here's a screenshot - <a href="https://gyazo.com/54f3486ded8029219a52e8ab4696bd9c" rel="nofollow noreferrer">gyazo.com/54f3486ded8029219a52e8ab4696bd9c</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Never mind, I accidently imported it wrong. it's indeed from HTMLParser import HTMLParser. thanks alot for everything!!! also I have a question , I've just seen a pyhton library called scrapy, is its role the same as HTMLParser?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know too much about scrapy, but it looks like it could also be helpful. From briefly looking at it, it looks like you'd be able to query for a specific tag name if you'd prefer that. Don't forget to select best answer :)</span>
