<p>I used Python2.7.10 before. Recently I change to python 3.6. However, when I want to import csv files it fails. My simple code is like this and I think it should work well in Python2.</p>
<pre><code>data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
</code></pre>
<p>And the error returns like:</p>
<pre><code>UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: invalid start byte
</code></pre>
<p>What does this mean and how can I solve this problem? Thanks.</p>
<h1>Update</h1>
<p>I've already solved it adding something like this:</p>
<pre><code>data = pd.read_csv(data.csv',sep='\t',encoding='utf-16')
</code></pre>
<p>Although I still don't know why it works, thanks for your help anyway.</p>

<p>and my encoding ended up being Windows codepage 1252</p>

<p>but your encoding could be anything...</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the encoding of your CSV file?  Can you show a small sample CSV demonstrating the problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">try passing <code>encoding = "ISO-8859-1"</code> as a parameter to <code>read_csv</code></span>

<span class="comment-copy">Sorry. Actually I have no idea what my CSV file encoding is. How can I check the encoding type? In fact, the data is downloaded from CSMAR, if you guys know.</span>
