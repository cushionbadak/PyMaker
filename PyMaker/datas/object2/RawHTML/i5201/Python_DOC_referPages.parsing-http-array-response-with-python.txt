<p>I'm trying to parse HTTP response via json, but it gives me character error, but when I'm trying to loop through this response via for loop, it splits everything in single characters. Is there better way to parse this response?</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>    _url = self.MAIN_URL
    try:
        _request = self.__webSession.get(_url, cookies=self.__cookies)
        if _request.status_code != 200:
            self.log("Request failed with code: {}. URL: {}".format(_request.status_code, _url))
            return
    except Exception as err:
        self.log("[e4] Web-request error: {}. URL: {}".format(err, _url))
        return

    _text = _request.json()

<p>json.loads() returns following</p>
<pre><code> Expecting value: line 1 column 110 (char 109)

<p>While the error message is confusing because of the line and column numbers, the <a href="https://www.json.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSON format</a> in any case does not accept single quotes for strings, so the given HTTP response is not in JSON format. You have to use double quotes for strings.</p>
<p>So you have to make the input like this instead (if you are in control of it):</p>
<pre><code>[
  [
    9266939,
    "Value1",
    "Value2",
    "Value3",
    "Value4",
    [
        [
        "number",
        "number2",
            [
            "value",
            "value2"
            ]
        ]
...
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not in control of the HTTP response you are parsing, you could replace all single quotes with double quotes before parsing:</p>
<pre><code>http_response_string = (get the HTTP response)
adjusted_http_response_string = http_response_string.replace("'", '"')
data = json.loads(adjusted_http_response_string)
</code></pre>
<p>But that of course comes with a potential risk of replacing single quotes (or apostrophes) that aren't meant to be string delimiters. It might solve the problem sufficiently, though, working most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>Further cleanup as requested in the comments:</p>
<pre><code>http_response_string = (get the HTTP response)

# More advanced replacement of ' with ", expecting
# strings to always come after at least four spaces,
# and always end in either comma, colon, or newline.
adjusted_http_response_string = \
    re.sub("(    )'", r'\1"',
    re.sub("'([,:\n])", r'"\1',
    http_response_string))

# Replacing faulty ",  ," with ",".
adjusted_http_response_string = \
    re.sub(",(\s*,)*", ",", 
    adjusted_http_response_string)

data = json.loads(adjusted_http_response_string)

<span class="comment-copy">You can use the json.loads function to get python like objects from your json text string. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/json.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can't, it returns -  Expecting value: line 1 column 110 (char 109)</span>

<span class="comment-copy">awesome , thank you very much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there some chance to replace empty values from http_response?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ReyCreed You're welcome. :-)  Empty values? Like instead of some JSON you get nothing? Can you come with an example? And what do you want these empty values to be replaced with?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edited my topic's http response with empty values, which are given. Everything is parsing pretty much well, but when there are some empty values, it throws me same error when there was single quotes - Expecting value: line 1 column 20 (char 19)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, the ", ," without anything in between the commas. Well, that's another JSON syntax error. I guess you want it to parse as if there is only one comma? In that case use <code>adjusted_http_response_string = re.sub(",(\s*,)*", ",", adjusted_http_response_string)</code> and <code>import re</code> earlier. But it's getting a bit long for answering in a comment. Are you in control of the HTTP output? It's not really JSON, and it should be corrected at the place it is generated.</span>
