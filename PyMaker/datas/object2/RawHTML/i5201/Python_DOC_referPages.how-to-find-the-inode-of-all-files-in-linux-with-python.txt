<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.stat" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>os.stat</em></a> function returns directory information about a file.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">inode</a> is stored in <em>st_ino</em> field.   Here's some code to get you started:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import glob
&gt;&gt;&gt; import os
&gt;&gt;&gt; for filename in glob.glob('*.py'):
        print(os.stat(filename).st_ino, filename)
</code></pre>
<p>To get the filesize, use the <em>st_size</em> field:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; os.stat(filename).st_size       
1481
</code></pre>
<p>To get the filename, just print the <em>filename</em> variable:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(filename)
'hello.py'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">"All files" means what? You want to trawl the entire filesystem? A specific directory? Something else? (And do you have a particularly good reason to want to use Python? A subprocess invoking <code>find / -printf '%i\t%P\0'</code> might well be faster to run, and the output will be trivial to unambiguously parse).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What specific part of what you want differs from what you have? Do you know how to retrieve stat data, but not where the inode is in that? Do you know how to retrieve stat data for a single file, but not how to recurse? If you have <i>both</i> those questions, they should probably be asked separately (or, even better, searched for separately, as each almost certainly exists in the knowledgebase individually)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes i want get list of all files system with inode , name ,size and ...</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I'd read "all" to mean, well, <i>all</i> -- ie. that they're looking for a solution that recurses into subdirectories a la <code>os.walk()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can I return the file name and file size with this code?</span>
