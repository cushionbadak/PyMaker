<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm having some trouble converting type 'str' to numbers. I use a separate text-file containing the following numbers <code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</code> and then I import these numbers into python and save them as a list.  However, by doing this, I get a list of strings as follows: <code>['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']</code>. I want to convert this list of strings so the list represents numbers, i.e. the output should be <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code>. </p>
<p>My code is: </p>
<pre><code>def imported_numbers(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f: 
        contents = f.read().splitlines() 
    print(contents)
imported_numbers('sample.txt')
</code></pre>
<p>Is there a specific command to do this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/map_filter.html#map" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>map</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>l = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']

new_l = list(map(int, l))  # or just map(int, l) in Python 2
</code></pre>
<p>will return</p>
<pre><code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
</code></pre>
<p>This can throw an error if there are strings that cannot be converted to numbers though:</p>
<pre><code>l = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', 'lkj']

list(map(int, l))
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'lkj'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So make sure your input is valid and/or wrap it into a <code>try/except</code>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>IMO it's more pythonic to say</p>
<pre><code>str_list = ['1', '2', '3']
new_list = [int(n) for n in str_list]
</code></pre>
<p>If you're not sure all of the strings will be valid numbers, you need to add appropriate error handling.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What does numerator/denominator have to do with this?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">imported_numbers does not return anything.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When calculating the mean from my imported list, I get the following Error handling: "TypeError: can't convert type 'str' to numerator/denominator"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You might want to replace <code>l</code> by <code>str_list</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexanderWest: Then you should provide some representative input; this and also my solution work fine for the example you posted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your help Cleb! I have now solved the problem. I also noticed that if I use large numbers I should use "float" instead of "int".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexanderWest: Glad you could solve it (an upvote helps me more than a 'thanks' though ;-) ).</span>
