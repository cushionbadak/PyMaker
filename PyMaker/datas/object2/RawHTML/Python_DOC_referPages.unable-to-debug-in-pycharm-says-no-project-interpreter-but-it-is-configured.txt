<p>I am unable to use the debugger in PyCharm. Looking around for an answer, the first thing I came across was to use the project interpreter.</p>
<p>If I go to the top left, "Edit Configurations" and de-select "Use Project Interpreter", then the code runs just fine, but the option to debug is grayed-out.</p>
<p>If I select "Use project interpreter", then go to settings and set the project interpreter to be the same one, I can't run the code at all, let alone debug it. Upon selecting the option, the message "!Error: No project interpreter configured" pops up immediately... but it <em>is</em> configured!</p>

<p>Followed these instructions to set up my project from an existing Conda environment: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html</a></p>
<p>I have made sure I clicked "apply" and also restarted PyCharm after that. This doesn't seem complicated, and at this point I have no idea what I can possibly be missing. Can anybody help? Thank you</p>

<p>The error was caused because I was using the Bash template instead of the Python template to set up my run configuration. This occurred because I had previously used PyCharm to run a bash script, and the option to create a Python template was collapsed by default, leading me to not realize my mistake.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Based on the second screenshot, it seems like the issue is that you're trying to use a <code>Bash</code> environment</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That was it, thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe so this question can be useful to others in the future, you could self-answer this question with how you accidentally got into that state as well as how you fixed it.</span>
