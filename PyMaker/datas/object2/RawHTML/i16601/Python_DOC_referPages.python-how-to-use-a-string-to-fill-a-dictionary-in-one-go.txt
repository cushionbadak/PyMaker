<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have this for example</p>
<pre><code>Dict = {'Hello':'World', 'Hi':'Again'}
x = (str(Dict))
Dict2 = {x}
print (Dict2)
</code></pre>
<p>I understand why it doesn't work that way but i'm new to python and have no idea what i'm doing.
I'd like to be able to export my dictionary to a variable (here x) and then able to fill another dictionary with it. I don't want to use the dict.copy() command, beacause the variable x will be stored on a txt file.
Any help is highly appreciated. 
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>If you actually want to use a string to do the copying, you can say:</p>
<pre><code>Dict2 = eval(repr(Dict))
</code></pre>
<p>but there's no reason you would ever need to do that. Use <code>dict.copy()</code> instead.</p>
<p>EDIT: Based on what you said in the comments, <code>json</code>, as another user has already pointed out, is the best way to go. That would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import json 

with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
    json.dump(Dict, f)

with open("file.txt") as f:
    Dict2 = json.load(f)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If what you're looking for is to save a dict-like string representation to a file so you can load it later, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">the <code>json</code> module</a>.  (This is not at all the same as "exporting a dictionary to a variable", but your comment indicates that what you're really trying to do is save a dictionary to a file.)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you can do to specifically address what you asked is:</p>
<pre><code>Dict = {'Hello':'World', 'Hi':'Again'}
x = str(Dict)
Dict2 = dict((y.split(':') for y in x[1:-1].strip().replace(" ","").replace("'","").split(',')))
</code></pre>
<p>or if you want to use dictionary comprehension</p>
<pre><code>Dict2 = {y.split(':')[0]:y.split(':')[1] for y in x[1:-1].strip().replace(" ","").replace("'","").split(',')} 
</code></pre>
<p>But I really <strong>would not suggest doing it this way</strong>. Instead I was suggest looking at either <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html" rel="nofollow">json</a> to save the dictionary to file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "it beats the purpose"?  It sounds like all you are doing is copying it, so why don't you want to use <code>copy</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't do <code>{x}</code> because you need a key-val assignment in dictionaries no matter what. So try <code>{'Dict' : x}</code> or something?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm trying to put the dictionary on a text file with file.write() and reading the string with file.read(). i'm doing this to save variables between progam uses.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Looks like you want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pickle</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">json</a> for your data.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TheD0ubleT: You should mention that in your question, then.  For that purpose, what you want is <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, works great, better and simpler as expected.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should be aware that this is much less efficient than <code>dict.copy()</code>. There is <b>no reason this is ever a good idea</b>. Additionally, if you found my answer helpful, please upvote and accept it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>eval</code> is never good idea. Better to use <code>ast.literal_eval</code>. And in this case <code>json</code> or <code>pickle</code> are the best solution.</span>
