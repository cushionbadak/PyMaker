<p>I have the following code on python 3.4:</p>
<pre><code>abrir = open("C:\\Users\\Jesus_Multilaser\\Desktop\\productos.txt","r+") # KNOW IT OPEN MY TEXT ARCHIVE
cantidad=cantidadBox.get() #IT GETS TEXT FROM ENTRY

leer = abrir.readlines() #READ LINES OF MY TEXT ARCHIVE
archivo = leer[0] #SELECT A SPECIFIC LINE
ubicacion = archivo.split("'") #SEPARATE 
claveReg = ubicacion[0] #GET A SPECIFIC PLACE
</code></pre>
<p>Now I want to write over "claveReg" place
I try with:</p>
<pre><code>claveReg.write(cantidad)
crear.close()
</code></pre>
<p>But it doesn't work.
Sorry for my bad english.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That's because you're trying to write to a string. Instead of <code>running claveReg.write()</code>, try <code>type(claveReg)</code>, or even better, just <code>print claveReg</code>. I suspect you'll find that it's just a string.</p>
<p>Since it is just a string, it doesn't have any link back to its location in the file. Instead, you should read the entire file into memory, make your changes, then overwrite the file. This isn't a Python limitation either, it has to do with how the OS handles file changes.</p>
<p>You might be able to overwrite specific areas of a file by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.seek" rel="nofollow"><code>file.seek</code></a> and <code>file.write</code>, but I would do so with extreme caution since it's seeking by bytes, not lines.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why doesn't it work, what <i>specifically</i> goes wrong?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to learn the difference between strings and file objects; reading the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python tutorial</a> might help. As it stands, this is like asking us why there's no hot water coming out of your hammer.</span>
