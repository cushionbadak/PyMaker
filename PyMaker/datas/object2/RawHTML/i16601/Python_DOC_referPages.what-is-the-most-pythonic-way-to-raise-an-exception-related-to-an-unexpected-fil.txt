<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Quick question. I am trying to write reusable code, and haven't found too many other instances of it coming up. Say a script is looking for an XML file, I could just raise a generic RuntimeException, but I am not sure if it would be informative for others using my code, or even the type of thing they would be likely to catch in an except statement. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>You can make your own exception by extending the base <code>Exception</code> class.</p>
