<p>I've developed a Python script that performs several tasks in a row (mainly connecting to servers and retrieving information).</p>
<p>There are many steps, and for each of them I would like to display a dot, so that the user knows there is something going on.</p>
<p>At the end of each step, I do:</p>
<pre><code>print('.', end='')
</code></pre>
<p>And in the final step, I write:</p>
<pre><code>print('Done!')
</code></pre>
<p>It works, except nothing is displayed until the final print is executed, so it kind of defeats its original purpose :)</p>
<p>Basically, nothing is displayed on the screen, and at the very last moment, this pops up:</p>
<pre><code>.......Done!
</code></pre>
<p>How can I force Python to print on the same line step after step?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>By default, <code>stdout</code> is line buffered, meaning the buffer won't be flushed until you write a newline.</p>
<p>Flush the buffer explicitly each time you print a <code>'.'</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print('.', end='', flush=True)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>flush</code> keyword was added in Python 3.3; for older versions, use <code>sys.stdout.flush()</code>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow"><code>print()</code> function documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether output is buffered is usually determined by <em>file</em>, but if the <em>flush</em> keyword argument is true, the stream is forcibly flushed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdout" rel="nofollow"><code>sys.stdout</code> documentation</a> (the default value for the <em>file</em> argument of the <code>print()</code> function):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When interactive, standard streams are line-buffered. Otherwise, they are block-buffered like regular text files.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Instead of using print, you can write directly to stdout, (unbuffered):</p>
<pre><code>import sys
import time

for i in range (10):
    time.sleep (0.5)
    sys.stdout.write('.')
print 'Done!'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>for python 2.7.3 you can left a trailing comma which tells the idle to not insert a line after the statement is printed for example </p>
<pre><code>print "hello",
print "world"
</code></pre>
<p>would return </p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hello world
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I was looking at the 3.0 documentation and didn't see the Flush option. In [the latest version[(<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print</a>) it's here :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I didn't know about the buffered/unbuffered thing.</span>
