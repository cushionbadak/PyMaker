<p>I am using Python 3.4 with PyCharm IDE. Some of the external libraries have been released for this version of Python. But most might not be presented yet, just like matplotlib.
I have you use this library. How can I use matlibplot for Python 3.3 in Python 3.4? Must I migrate again to python 3.3?!</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>If the library is pure Python then any code that runs in Python 3.3 should also run in Python 3.4.</p>
<p>If the library contains Python byte code (pyc) then there is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22449524/python-bytecode-compatibility">no guarantee of compatibility</a>. You have to recompile the Python code.</p>
<p>if the library contains c code (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8822335/what-does-python-file-extensions-pyc-pyd-pyo-stand-for">pyd</a>) then you have no guarantee of Python C API compatibility unless the library made <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/stable.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">some specific switches for it</a>. You would have to recompile the C code.</p>
<p>Matplotlib falls into the latter categories. However there are version of matplotlib compiled against Python 3.4 (for <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Windows</a>). Or you have to go back to Python 3.3.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">many of python packages support in that major version. means when a package works in python3 most of the time it supports all of python3 versions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What happens when you try to run Matplotlib? Does it look like a simple error that we could fix?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@jforberg: Actually, there is no error generated by IDE compiler. I've just imported matplotlib 3.3 into my 3.4-driven project. As I call the older functions, I got neither the valid result nor any error!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As I think I've been encountering with pyc case probably, Would you please letting me know about the recompiling procedure?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@matinking You just delete them all. They are created automatically from the corresponding py files which must be there of course. Or you use <a href="http://effbot.org/pyfaq/how-do-i-create-a-pyc-file.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">compile all</a>.</span>
