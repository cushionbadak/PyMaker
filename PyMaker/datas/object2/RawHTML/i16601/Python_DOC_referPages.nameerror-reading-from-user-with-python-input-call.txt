<p>I am a python newbie and have written a short program. The first part works but the if statement part has a traceback/syntax? problem. Advice?</p>
<pre><code>hours = input("How many hours did you work this week?")
wage = input("How much do you make each hour?")
weeklySalary = hours * wage
print "You made", weeklySalary, "dollars this week."
daily = str(input("Would you like to know your daily average this week?"))
if daily in ['Yes' , 'yes' , 'Y' , 'y']:
    print "You averaged", (weeklySalary / 7), "dollars per day."
else:
    print "Maybe next week..."
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the error:</p>
<pre><code>How many hours did you work this week?10
How much do you make each hour?10
You made 100 dollars this week.
Would you like to know your daily average this week?yes
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/jake/Desktop/Python_U_M/weekly_salary.py", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    daily = str(input("Would you like to know your daily average this week?"))
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'yes' is not defined
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is that <code>input</code> is evaluating your input, so <code>eval(y)</code> is raising the error:</p>
<pre><code>How many hours did you work this week?10
How much do you make each hour?7
You made 70 dollars this week.
Would you like to know your daily average this week?y
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "hmm", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    daily = str(input("Would you like to know your daily average this week?"))
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'y' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>Compare to:</p>
<pre><code>How many hours did you work this week?10
How much do you make each hour?7
You made 70 dollars this week.
Would you like to know your daily average this week?"y"
You averaged 10 dollars per day.

<p>Docs:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#input</a></p>
<p>As noted in the docs, "Consider using the raw_input() function for general input from users." Making this change prevents 'y' from being evaluated, thus treating is as a string, like you're expecting.</p>
<p>The problem doesn't manifest on the integers because <code>eval(10)</code> is still <code>10</code>.</p>
<p>Confirmed via Python 2.6.5. Your code would likely work as-is in Python 3 -- docs for input in Python 3 do not include the implicit <code>eval</code>: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Presumably this is Python 2.x and you should therefore be using <code>raw_input</code>. However, it is generally helpful to provide the full error traceback rather than a vague problem description.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there is no syntax error there ...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It'd be useful to show the syntax error you're getting.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JoranBeasley: but if you entered 'Y' a <code>NameError</code> will be raised..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Plenty of dupes: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/17413502">"NameError: name 'n' is not defined" even though it's an input - Python</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/21122540">Python input() error - NameError: name '...' is not defined</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/11280194">NameError: name 'book' is not defined</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/6163596">Python, name not defined</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/16457441">NameError from Python input() function</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/15190632">NameError: name 'now' is not defined</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">How about <code>eval(010)</code> being treated as octal and result will be <code>8</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. I changed input to raw_input and it worked. Should I be using raw_input everywhere - even when expecting in integer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It has to be quoted -- <code>eval('010')</code> evaluates to 8, whereas <code>eval(010)</code> raises a TypeError. But sure. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DreadPirateShawn but I was thinking in terms of <code>raw_input</code> or <code>input</code> but you are right.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Jake -- the docs are your guide. The "consider using raw input" advice is already copied in my answer... then, given that <code>input(prompt)</code> equates to <code>eval(raw_input(prompt))</code>, the question for you is, "Do you want the user's input to be evaluated?" <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#eval</a> That is -- do you want a user to be able to input <code>10 + 4</code> to convey that they worked 14 hours? Don't <code>eval</code> things unless you want them to be <code>eval</code>ed.</span>
