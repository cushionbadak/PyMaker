<p>I have svg files which I would like to compare based on their dimensions. </p>
<p>I read about PIL as the best image tool in python. Does PIL handle svg files? I can't seem to find this anywhere.</p>
<p>When googling I saw people interpreting svg files as text which seems counterintuitive. </p>
<p>What if not PIL is be the best way to get the x &amp; y dimensions of a .svg file? </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>PIL handles <a href="http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handbook/image-file-formats.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">many image types</a>, but not (yet?) SVG.  Partly, this is because SVG is a set of instructions to produce an image, not a container for raw image data.</p>
<p>Fortunately, SVG can be read as XML, using the tool of your choice; for example, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">xml.etree.ElementTree</a> in the Python standard library.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, by its nature, SVG doesn't have a single native size.  Instead, <a href="https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/71568/is-there-any-concept-of-size-in-an-svg">it has two size concepts</a>: the view box, and the height and width attributes.</p>
<p>If your svg file has <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes, you can safely use those as the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> dimensions, respectively.  Otherwise, if it has a <code>viewBox</code> attribute, it is meant to scale to any size you need it to; however, you can use its third and fourth numbers as width and height, if you need to.</p>
<p>Worse, SVG files could lack either one.  In that case, one could potentially compute a height and width based on the elements in the file, but that's trickier than anyone really wants to do, given the full capabilities of the format.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">People interpret SVG files as text because SVG files are actually XML text files that can be <i>interpreted</i> to render images.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can try using <a href="http://codeboje.de/pysvg/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PySVG</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">using pysvg I have pysvg.parse(my file), however how can I get the x and y dimensions out? I am looking for clear documentation and I only see how to create svg not get info back out</span>
<span class="comment-copy">pysvg when I installed using sudo easy_install pysvg as a pysvg.egg file and I couldn't use it correctly?</span>
