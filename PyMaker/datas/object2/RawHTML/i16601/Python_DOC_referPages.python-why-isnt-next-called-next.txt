<p>I'm using Python 2.7. </p>
<p>By convention, builtin methods like <code>__iter__</code>, <code>__init__</code>, <code>__str__</code>, etc. have the double underscore to identify them as such. Why doesn't the <code>next()</code> function have this? </p>
<p>It features alongside the other built-in functions here: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html</a> and this doesn't seem like a very consistent convention.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The built-in function doesn't have <code>__</code> because none of the built-ins do. You're confusing built-ins (like <code>str</code>) with special methods (like <code>__str__</code>).</p>
<p>Now the special method called by the built-in <code>next</code> is also called <code>next</code> in Python 2.7, but that naming was recognized as an accident and changed to <code>__next__</code> in Python 3.</p>

<p>It was in Python v3.x. And is still there for backwards compatibility. From <a href="http://docs.pythonsprints.com/python3_porting/py-porting.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.pythonsprints.com/python3_porting/py-porting.html</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Python 3 introduced a next() function to replace the next() method on
  iterator objects. Rather than calling the method on the iterator, the
  next() function is called with the iterable object as its sole
  parameter, which calls the underlying <code>__next__()</code> method.</p>
