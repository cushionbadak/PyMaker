<p>I'm using JSON data from the <a href="http://worldcup.sfg.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SFG WorldCup API</a>.</p>
<p>What I need to do is to find the most recent goal scored by a given team in a given match. To do that, I need to sort by the value of the <code>attribute</code> key in each element of the array that is the attribute of the <code>away_team_events</code> attribute. </p>
<p>Let me illustrate. </p>
<p>Here's sample JSON for France from the ongoing (at the time of writing) France v Switzerland.</p>
<pre><code>"away_team_events": [
            {
                "id": 276, 
                "type_of_event": "goal", 
                "player": "Giroud", 
                "time": "17"
            }, 
            {
                "id": 277, 
                "type_of_event": "goal", 
                "player": "Matuidi", 
                "time": "18"
            }, 
            {
                "id": 278, 
                "type_of_event": "penalty-wrong", 
                "player": "Benzema", 
                "time": "32"
            }, 
            {
                "id": 279, 
                "type_of_event": "goal", 
                "player": "Valbuena", 
                "time": "40"
            }, 
            {
                "id": 281, 
                "type_of_event": "substitution-in", 
                "player": "Pogba", 
                "time": "63"
            }, 
            {
                "id": 282, 
                "type_of_event": "substitution-in", 
                "player": "Koscielny", 
                "time": "66"
            }, 
            {
                "id": 283, 
                "type_of_event": "goal", 
                "player": "Benzema", 
                "time": "67"
            }
        ]
</code></pre>
<p>So what I need to do here is find which "id" attribute is greatest, because that will be the latest goal. </p>
<p>How do I sort by a specific attribute like this?</p>
<p>I've seen <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13438574/sorting-json-data-by-keys-value">this question</a>, but I can't really make sense of the answers.</p>
<p>EDIT: rephrase, sorry for the confusion. </p>
<p>I don't need to necessarily rearrange them, but how do I identify which item in the list has the greatest id, and use that?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is my solution, which use the <code>max()</code> function. All I have to do is to tell <code>max</code> how to sort, in this case, by the <code>id</code> field:</p>
<pre><code>import json
with open('events.json') as f:
    events = json.load(f)
    event = max(events['away_team_events'], key=lambda ev: ev['id'])
    print event
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>{u'type_of_event': u'goal', u'player': u'Benzema', u'id': 283, u'time': u'67'}
</code></pre>
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<ul>
<li><code>events</code> is a JSON data with just one key: <em>away_team_events</em></li>
<li><code>events['away_team_events']</code> is a list of 7 items. From this list, we are going to select an item with the greatest event ID</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want "the most X" item in a list, where X is "recent" or anything else, you use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow"><code>max()</code></a>, which can take an optional key function. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.itemgetter" rel="nofollow"><code>operator.itemgetter()</code></a> is the one you want in this case:</p>
<pre><code>from operator import itemgetter
data = json.loads("whatever")
latest_goal = max(data["away_team_events"], key=itemgetter("id"))
</code></pre>
<p>Or (as Martijn and Burhan point out) if you can guarantee that the list of dictionaries is already sorted by <code>id</code>, just getting the last one will work:</p>
<pre><code>latest_goal = data["away_team_events"][-1]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">but it appears to be already sorted..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ChristianBerendt: this is a <i>list of dictionaries</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Its already a list and assuming that its populated live, then it will be in the order of the actual events; so the last <i>event</i> will be the last item on the list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters I don't think this question is a duplicate of that one. Despite the title, evamvid isn't looking to sort the list, but to find a maximum value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <i>other</i> dupe is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/5320871">In List of Dicts, find min() value of a common Dict field</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">would the <code>latest_goal</code> variable then contain an index for the list?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@evamvid no, it's just the dictionary that satisfies your criteria.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm having problems today: Traceback says <code>Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Users\User\Docs\Programming\WC.py", line 28, in &lt;module&gt; goalindex = max(math['home_team_events'], key=itemgetter("id")) TypeError: 'Response' object has no attribute '__getitem__'</code>.  So it seems like it's a problem with the JSON I'm getting....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@evamvid that error has nothing to do with the correctness of this answer; you have a new problem (that you're attempting to treat a HTTP response as though it were the result of parsing a JSON document). You'll need to post a new question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure if it's really a new problem or not. What I'm trying to figure out is whether the JSON is invalid (as stated above) or if the method  you suggested is incompatible because of the way requests returns data...I honestly have no idea what's going on here...</span>
