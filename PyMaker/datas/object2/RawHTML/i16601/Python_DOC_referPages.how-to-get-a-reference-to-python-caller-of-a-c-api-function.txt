<p>I am implementing an embedded python interpreter following <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html</a></p>
<p>There is a way for me to easily create my own APIs to my C program so that a user can call my own internal C functions from a python script.</p>
<p>This all works fine, but I would like to be able to know from which script the function got called. Every function must have these parameters according to manual:</p>
<pre><code>static PyObject *SomeApiFunction(PyObject *self, PyObject *args)
</code></pre>
<p>But the manual doesn't explain what <code>self</code> is so I assumed that self is a reference to module that called the function, which was probably wrong. I tried to call <code>PyModule_GetName</code> on self and it returned the internal name of my application which I set during initialization (using <code>PyModule_Create</code>).</p>
<p>Is there a way to recognize which module called my C function?</p>

<p>If you were doing this in Python, you could use the following line:</p>
<pre><code>module_path = sys._getframe(1).f_code.co_filename
</code></pre>
<p>You might be able to do something similar in the C API, but I have never worked with it.</p>
