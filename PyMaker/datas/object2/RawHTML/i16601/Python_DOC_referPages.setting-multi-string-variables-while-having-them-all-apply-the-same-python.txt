<p>I'm new to programming and I need some help for a ai robot I just started on
Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>    complements = "nice" and "happy" and "good" and "smart" and "wonderful"
    var = "You are a "+ complements
    input = raw_input

   if var in input:
        print "Thank you!"
   else:
        print "Wuhhhhh?"
</code></pre>
<p>If I type in something other than "nice" it goes to the else statement.
Or statements don't work</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First, the <code>and</code> keyword does not do what you want. It is used as a binary comparison. Due to the inner workings of Python, your variable <code>complements</code> will receive the value <code>"wonderful"</code>. You want to put these words in a list (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>). You will then be able to manipulate these words using concatenation as such (for example):</p>
<pre><code>var = "You are a " + ", ".join(complements)
</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore, <code>raw_input</code> is a function. It must be called as such: <code>raw_input()</code>. Otherwise, you just create an alias of the function which you named <code>input</code>. You would still have to call it by appending <code>()</code> to it in order to receive the user input.</p>
<p>I also don't understand your <code>if var in input:</code> statement. <code>var</code> is a sentence you made, why would you search it in the user input? It would be clearer to do <code>if raw_input() in complements</code>, or something along the lines of it.</p>
<p>If you are beginning to learn Python, I would recommend you to use Python 3 instead of Python 2. <code>raw_input()</code> was renamed <code>input()</code> in Python 3.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>input = raw_input()</code> [with the <code>()</code>]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, complements should be a list: <code>["nice", "happy"]</code>. Please do read about python lists, inputs and if statements. It seems as if you have some fundamental semantics misunderstandings that you should correct as soon as possible</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what are you trying to acheive. please provide Expected out put</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was planning on changing the strings, but first I wanted to get the code done.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok thanks for the help (Yeah, I'm a python noob)</span>
