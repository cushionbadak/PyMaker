<p>I'm trying to check whether a specific value in a dictionary is present. It seems that with keys, a simple <code>if 'x' in 'dictionary'</code> statement works, yet not for values.</p>
<pre><code>dictionary = {
    'First': '1',
    'Second': '2',
    'Third': '3'
}

if 'First' in dictionary:
    print('First is here')

if '1' in dictionary:
    print('1 is here')
</code></pre>
<p>So the obvious logical error is that the output only reads:</p>
<pre><code>First is here
</code></pre>
<p>Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you. </p>

<p>If you want to access the dictionary's values, you need to call <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.values" rel="nofollow"><code>dict.values</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>if '1' in dictionary.values():
</code></pre>
<p>It is not necessary to call <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.keys" rel="nofollow"><code>dict.keys</code></a> however:</p>
<pre><code>if 'First' in dictionary.keys():
</code></pre>
<p>because the <code>in</code> operator iterates over the dictionary, which yields its keys.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow">docs on <code>dict</code></a>. The <code>key in d</code> operator on a dictionary looks for a key in the <code>dict</code>'s keys, not its values.</p>
<p>To look in the values, use <code>value in d.values()</code>.</p>
<p>Also, this is a less efficient O(size of dict) operation. If you're constantly searching for values, you should generally use a different data structure (maybe a sorted list depending on the exact use case).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Though for keys you should be able to just do <code>if 'First' in diction</code>. Oh, sorry, I see that was what the OP did. NM</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, got it now. Sorry :-)  (Need more coffee)</span>
