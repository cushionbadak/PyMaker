<p>You should open files in a <code>with</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>with open('text.txt', 'r') as data:
  plaintext = data.read()

plaintext = plaintext.replace(',', '')
</code></pre>
<p>the <code>with</code> statement ensures that resources are released properly, so you don't have to worry about remembering to close them.</p>
<p>The more substantial thing you were missing is that <code>data</code> is a file object, and replace works on strings. <code>data.read()</code> returns the string of text in the file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You have to read the data from the file into a string first. Read the docs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/tutorial/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't use <code>chdir</code>. Just open the file with <code>with open(os.path.join(my_directory, 'text.txt'), 'r') as data:</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why does it matter?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can anyone tell me why I got 4 thumbs down for this Q? Banning my account is useless without a proper explanation!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you! now is there a way to save this updated file that replaces the old one?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah. If you open the file using <code>with open('text.txt', 'w') as data:</code> after you've gotten the text and done your modifications, you can then use <code>data.write(plaintext)</code> to overwrite the contents of the old file. I recommend looking at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> at this point to see where you can go from here</span>
<span class="comment-copy">awesome, thanks i'll check it out</span>
