<p>I am reading a <a href="http://zetcode.com/lang/python/lexicalstructure/" rel="nofollow">tutorial</a> about python, it's lexical structure to be more precise.
And I just want to know why in Python, the: </p>
<pre><code>+= , -= ,  *= ,  /= ,  //= ,  %=, &lt;= ,  |= ,  ^= , &gt;&gt;= , &lt;&lt;=  , **= 
</code></pre>
<p>are considered as delimiters and not operators? After all, the "+=" is an increment operator, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The syntax you refer to are used in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#augmented-assignment-statements">augmented assignment statements</a>. Like regular <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#assignment-statements">assignment</a>, these are not expressions, so they are <em>not operators either</em>.</p>
<p>They happen to <em>closely resemble</em> certain arithmetic operators, but only in that they fall back to using those operators if the assignment target does not implement a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__iadd__">specific augmented assignment special method</a> for the operation.</p>
<p>Delimiters are tokens that do not require whitespace around them in source code, which is why those tokens are listed in that list.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by "delimiters"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Source? Hard to explain choice of vocabulary when you don't provide your source.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh I see, that makes sense actually.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In a language grammar you have syntax like &lt;expr&gt; := &lt;expr&gt; &lt;opr&gt; &lt;expr&gt;. It is how the interpreter goes through and tokenizes the lines of code. I'm guessing it is called a delimiter, because it can separate expressions. Like what FlexKling said in the lexical analysis for the compiler/interpreter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't need whitespace around tokens that are also delimiters. That's all.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is exactly the documentation link I was looking for, +1.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So even if they perform some function, they are not considered as operators or expressions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@the-sizixe: Exactly. They cannot be used as part of a larger expression, which operators <i>can</i> be used for.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, thank you. I understand now.</span>
