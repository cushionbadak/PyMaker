<p>I'm trying to use the Python GUI <code>wx</code> (installable via <code>pip install wxPython</code>) in the following minimal app:</p>
<pre><code>import wx
app = wx.App()
</code></pre>
<p>Running this snippet returns the following:</p>
<pre><code>This program needs access to the screen. Please run with a Framework
build of python, and only when you are logged in on the main display
of your Mac.
</code></pre>
<p>Does anyone know how to help wx gain "access to the screen", or what a "Framework build of Python" is? I'd be grateful for any help others can offer with these questions!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This resolves the problem, but it can't be the prettiest solution:</p>
<pre><code># install anaconda
install anaconda

# uninstall all versions of pythonWx
pip uninstall pythonWx -y
conda remove pythonwx

# install the python.app binary through conda
conda install python.app

# determine where the conda binary lives
which conda

# that previous command returns something like: 
# /Users/yaledhlab/anaconda3/bin/conda
# replace the /conda with /python.app
# and run the result in a terminal
/Users/yaledhlab/anaconda3/bin/python.app

# that should open a Python terminal (you know you're in the Python
# terminal if you see &gt;&gt;&gt; as a prefix for your shell)
# import the python package manager and install wxPython to
# your python.app version of Python
import pip
pip.main(['install', 'wxPython'])

# exit the python interpreter
exit()

# run the program
/Users/yaledhlab/anaconda3/bin/python.app main.py
</code></pre>

<p>There is an installer for OSX on the official wxPython web-site.</p>
<p>Just download it and install.</p>
<p>You don't need to play with anaconda just to install and run such a simple application.</p>

<p>wxPython on Mac within a virtual environment throws this error, as explained by wxPython website here: <a href="https://wiki.wxpython.org/wxPythonVirtualenvOnMac" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://wiki.wxpython.org/wxPythonVirtualenvOnMac</a></p>
<p>If you are not running it in a virtual environment and still receive this error, try running your script that uses wxpython with "pythonw" instead of "python". Ex: "pythonw hello.py"</p>
<p>^See section "4.1.2 Running Scripts with a GUI" (on MacOS) from the following page in the Python Docs to see this python quirk explained: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">I think this blogpost may have a soultion <a href="https://blurringexistence.net/wxpython-using-virtualenvwrapper-on-osx.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">blurringexistence.net/â€¦</a>. I didn't get a chance to read the whole thing though, so I'm not entirely sure.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Running my script with <code>pythonw</code> worked for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@lanery can you give me more detail how to run script in pythonw?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@pill45 try running <code>which pythonw</code> (assuming you are on unix). If you get output, that means the pythonw binary is on your path, so you can use: <code>pythonw myscript.py</code>. If you install Anaconda on your machine, that should give you access to pythonw</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When I run pythonw in the virtualenv where I install wx, it shows no module named wx, what did I miss?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">do you have a link? This is what I see on their downloads page: <a href="https://www.wxpython.org/pages/downloads/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wxpython.org/pages/downloads</a> If you are talking about <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/3.0.2.0/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/3.0.2.0</a> the installers I tried simply didn't work -- did they work on your machine?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@duhaime, yes, it did. I guess Robin re-did the website design and push the wxPython to the PyPI place. What problem(s) did you encounter trying to install from the SF? Did you report it to the wxPython ML?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I didn't record and can't recall the error I had, though I just downloaded and built the code and it came through fine (though I'm still not sure how I'd run the Python script with these application files). That said, I spent an hour helping a professor get old student code running; it's unlikely I'll use this library again...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@duhaime, if it is the old code that was written with the old wxPython version there will be an effort to update it to the new version. And depending on the version it used to be written that effort might be significant. But this is no different from any other library out there - you still need to fix some stuff before everything compiles and runs smoothly. The only way to simplify is to upgrade gradually along with new releases, which you professor didn't do. And so the hour sounds like a very good time frame.</span>
