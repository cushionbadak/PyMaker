<p>Although this should be rather easily done with a for loop, I'm wondering wether there is a concise way to delete a set of positions from a Python list. E.g.:</p>
<pre><code>l = ["A","B","C","D","E","F","G"]
pos = [4,6]
# Is there something close to
l.remove(pos)
</code></pre>
<p>Best</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#the-del-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">del</a> is what you are looking for if you <em>have consecutive indices</em>:</p>
<p>From the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the del statement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Otherwise, you could generate a new list, by filtering out indices, which you aren't interested in </p>
<pre><code>result = [x for i, x in enumerate(l) if i not in pos]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes. It is a duplicate. Sorry.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How does <code>del</code> delete a <i>set</i> of positions?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@StefanPochmann depends, if you have a <i>set</i> of consecutive indices, it'll work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So the indexes in their example <code>[4,6]</code> are consecutive?</span>
