<p>I am figuring out the differences between the <code>pickle.load()</code> and <code>pickle.loads()</code>. Somebody said what kind of object that <code>pickle.load()</code> process is "file_like_object",  however, <code>pickle.loads()</code> corresponds to "file object".</p>

<p>Your choice of which function to use depends on the object from whence you are loading the pickled data:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.loads" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pickle.loads</code></a> is used to load pickled data from a <code>bytes</code> string. The "s" in <code>loads</code> refers to the fact that in Python 2, the data was loaded from a <em>string</em>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

with open("myobj.pickle", "rb") as f:
    rawdata = f.read()

myobj = pickle.loads(rawdata)
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle.load" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pickle.load</code></a> is used to load pickled data from a <em>file-like object</em>. This is any object that acts like a file - in this case, meaning it has a <code>read()</code> method that returns <code>bytes</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle

with open("myobj.pickle", "rb") as f:
    myobj = pickle.load(f)
</code></pre>

<p>This same convention applies to the <code>dump</code>/<code>dumps</code> functions in the pickle library, as well as the <code>json</code> module and others.</p>
