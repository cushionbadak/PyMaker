<p>I need a code where Python can invoke a <code>cmd</code> process, run a command.</p>
<p>I have to find whether that command succeeds or not and proceed accordingly in the python code.</p>
<p>The codes I have fount on stackoverflow deals only with opening cmd and running commands.</p>
<p>I don't want to use the <code>runas</code> as it requires admin privilege, which I have incorporated in my program later and should not be used here.(suggest it only if doesn't invoke a UAC and doesn't require admin privileges.</p>
<p>the only code I have found to run <code>cmd</code> without admin privilege is:</p>
<pre><code>command = "cmd.exe" 
proc = subprocess.Popen(command, stdin = subprocess.PIPE, stdout = subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre>
<p>I don't know if the <code>proc</code> variable can be used to detect the return value or any other thing, guide me accordingly and suggest better code if possible.</p>

<p>Yes, the result of <code>Popen</code> can be used to detect the return value and output, but it's easier to use <code>subprocess.run</code>. From the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>: </p>
<pre><code>subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"])  # doesn't capture output

result = subprocess.run(["ls", "-l", "/dev/null"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE) # returns a CompletedProcess
</code></pre>
<p>You can interrogate <code>result</code> (again, from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.CompletedProcess" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>):</p>
<pre><code>result.returncode # process return code
result.stdout # std out from the process
</code></pre>
