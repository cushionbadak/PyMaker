<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So, I'm just starting to program Python and I wanted to make a very simple script that will say something like "Gabe- Hello, my name is Gabe (Just an example of a sentence" + "Jerry- Hello Gabe, I'm Jerry" OR "Gabe- Goodbye, Jerry" + "Jerry- Goodbye, Gabe". Here's pretty much what I wrote.</p>
<pre><code> answers1 = [
"James-Hello, my name is James!"
]
answers2 = [
    "Jerry-Hello James, my name is Jerry!"
    ]
answers3 = [
    "Gabe-Goodbye, Samuel."
        ]
 answers4 = [
    "Samuel-Goodbye, Gabe"
    ]
Jack1 = (answers1 + answers2)
Jack2 = (answers3 + answers4)
Jacks = ([Jack1,Jack2])
import random
for x in range(2):
    a = random.randint(0,2)
    print (random.sample([Jacks, a]))
</code></pre>
<p>I'm quite sure it's a very simple fix, but as I have just started Python (Like, literally 2-3 days ago) I don't quite know what the problem would be. Here's my error message</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:/Users/Owner/Documents/Test Python 3.py", line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
print (random.sample([Jacks, a]))
TypeError: sample() missing 1 required positional argument: 'k'
</code></pre>
<p>If anyone could help me with this, I would very much appreciate it! Other than that, I shall be searching on ways that may be relevant to fixing this.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The problem is that <code>sample</code> requires a parameter <code>k</code> that indicates how many random samples you want to take. However in this case it looks like you do not need <code>sample</code>, since you already have the random integer. Note that that integer should be in the range <code>[0,1]</code>, because the list <code>Jack</code> has only two elements.</p>
<pre><code>    a = random.randint(0,1)
    print (Jacks[a])
</code></pre>
<p>or the same behavior with <code>sample</code>, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22741319/what-does-random-sample-method-in-python-do">here</a> for an explanation.</p>
<pre><code>   print (random.sample(Jacks,1))
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>random.sample([Jacks, a])
</code></pre>
<p>This <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/random.html#random.sample" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sample</a> method should looks like </p>
<pre><code>random.sample(Jacks, a)
</code></pre>
<p>However, I am concerted you also have no idea how lists are working. Can you explain why do you using lists of strings and then adding values in them? I am losing you here.</p>
<p>If you going to pick a pair or strings, use method described by Florian (requesting data by <code>index</code> value.)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>k parameter tell random.sample function that how many sample you need, you should write:</p>
<pre><code> print (random.sample([Jacks, a], 3))
</code></pre>
<p>which means you need 3 sample from your list. the output will be something like:</p>
<pre><code>[1, jacks, 0]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You've inserted a list as the argument to random.sample. Just use <code>random.sample(Jacks, a)</code></span>
