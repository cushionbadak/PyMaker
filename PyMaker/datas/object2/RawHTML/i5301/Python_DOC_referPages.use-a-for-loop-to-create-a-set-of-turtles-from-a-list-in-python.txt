<p>I'm attempting to create a list of turtles in Python. I can achieve this manually by the following:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()

one = turtle.Turtle()
two = turtle.Turtle()
</code></pre>
<p>I'm hoping to iterate through a list of turtle names using the following for loop, but the syntax is throwing me:</p>
<pre><code>import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()

for turtleName in ["one","two"]:
    turtleName = turtle.Turtle()

one.left(60)
one.forward(160)

NameError: name 'one' is not defined
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you do</p>
<pre><code>for turtleName in ["one","two"]:
    turtleName = turtle.Turtle()
</code></pre>
<p>You're creating a variable inside this loop and for each value inside your list, it's getting its value.</p>
<p>For an example, in the first iteration, the value inside turtleName will be 'one' and in the second iteration it will be 'two'.</p>
<p>When you do</p>
<pre><code>turtleName = turtle.Turtle()
</code></pre>
<p>You are overwriting the value that turtleName was given by the loop.</p>
<p>What you want is to create variables dynamically, which I don't know if it's possible, but you can use dict to do something close to what you want, for an example, you can try</p>
<pre><code>names = ['one', 'two']
turtle_dict = dict()

for name in names:
   turtle_dict[name] = turtle.Turtle()
</code></pre>
<p>So when you want to call the turtle by its name, you can do</p>
<pre><code>turtle_dict['one'].left(60)
</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>turtle_dict['two'].left(60)
</code></pre>
<p>For more information about how dict work, you can check in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I hope this helps :)</p>

<p>What you're trying to do at</p>
<pre><code>for turtleName in ["one","two"]:
    turtleName = turtle.Turtle()
</code></pre>
<p>is assigning the variable turtleName the value "one".
Like what  juanpa.arrivillaga said, use a dictionary.</p>
<pre><code>import turtle
wn = turtle.Screen()
dict = {}
for turtleName in ["one","two"]:
    dict[turtleName] = turtle.Turtle()

dict["one"].left(60)
dict["two"].forward(160)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">don't do this. use a <code>dict</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That makes perfect sense. Thanks for the assist!</span>
