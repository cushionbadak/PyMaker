<p>Could someone tell me whether this idea is feasible in Python?
I want to have a method and the datatype of the signature is not fixed.</p>
<p>For example: 
Foo(data1, data2)      &lt;-- Method Definition in Code</p>
<ul>
<li>Foo(2,3)    &lt;---- Example of what would be executed in runtime</li>
<li>Foo(s,t)    &lt;---- Example of what would be executed in runtime</li>
</ul>
<p>I know the code could work if i change the Foo(s,t) to Foo("s","t"). But I am trying to make the code smarter to recognize the command without the "" ...</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.singledispatch" rel="nofollow noreferrer">singledispatch</a> might be an answer, which transforms a function into a generic function, which can have different behaviors depending upon the type of <strong>its first argument</strong>.</p>
<p>You could see a concrete example in the above link. And you should do some special things if you want to do generic dispatch on more than one arguments.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>Foo(s, t)</code> is just fine as long as <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> are defined.</span>
