<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I try to make a Toy class here</p>
<pre><code>class Toy:

  def __init__(self,name,ID,price,age):


    self.__ToyName = name  
    self.__ToyID = ID
    self.__Price = price
    self.__MinimumAge = int(age)
##some methods here
</code></pre>
<p>And when i try to make a sub-class computer game, i need to make 7 arguments(with 5 from the Toy class)to instantiating the computer game class, and it shows "too many arguements (7/5)"</p>
<pre><code>class ComputerGame(Toy): 
  def __init__(self,name,ID,price,age,catogory,console):

    Toy.__init__(self,name,ID,price,age)
    self.__Catogory = catogory
    self.__Console = console
</code></pre>
<p>What should I do to with this situation?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you need learn more about <code>super</code></p>
<pre><code>class ComputerGame(Toy): 
  def __init__(self, name, ID, price, age, catogory, console):
    super(ComputerGame, self).__init__(name, ID, price, age)
    self.__Catogory = catogory
    self.__Console = console
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>self.toy = Toy(name,ID,price,age)</code> or similar is what you want. Check the dup for more details.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't know what you did, because I see no problem in you code, and my python doesn't either...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd write <code>super().__init__(name, ID, price, age)</code> but be careful, <code>super</code> does not work like in other languages. Your code is correct, tho. You should just do <code>ComputerGame(name, ID, price, age, category, console)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, unless you really know what you're doing and why, don't use class attribute names starting with a double underscore. See (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1301346/what-is-the-meaning-of-a-single-and-a-double-underscore-before-an-object-name" title="what is the meaning of a single and a double underscore before an object name">stackoverflow.com/questions/1301346/…</a>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There are information about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=super#super" rel="nofollow noreferrer">super</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! Does it mean if I got a sub class with multiple variables I will have to use the <code>super</code> method? And how do I deal with class that itself has a very long list of variables?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is no problem that you give a very long list of variables. However I have a little suggestion about parameters： 1. Whether need split to more class, 2. Maybe give some default parameter? 3. Use keywords parameters?</span>
