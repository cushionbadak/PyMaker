<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I created a list of magician names. I am trying to add "The Great" to each individual item in the list while permanently changing the list format. Here is my code so far:</p>
<pre><code>magician_names = ['houdini' , 'chris angel', 'ted']
def show_magicians():
    print("These are your magicians tonight.")
    while magician_names:
        print(magician_names)
        break
show_magicians()

def make_great():
    for name in magician_names:
            while True:
                ['The Great' , name]
                break
    print(magician_names)
</code></pre>
<p>I can create a for loop and a string to print each individual name with 'The Great' in front of it like so:</p>
<pre><code>for magician in magician_names:
    print("The Great " + magician)
</code></pre>
<p>which prints this result:</p>
<pre><code>The Great houdini
The Great chris angel
The Great ted
</code></pre>
<p>But I want it so when I call the function and print the list 'magician_names', that it prints off an altered version of the list formatted like this:</p>
<pre><code>['the great houdini' , 'the great chris angel', 'the great ted']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This gives the derised output:</p>
<pre><code>magician_names = ['houdini' , 'chris angel', 'ted']
l = ['The Great ' + name for name in magician_names]
print(l)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Thanks for the help, I finally got it though. I put this code in the second function and when both the functions are called, the code runs back as desired.:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(0, len(magician_names)):
        magician_names[i] = "The Great " + magician_names[i]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">No clue what it is you're doing exactly, but you're overcomplicating a simple problem. Lists are mutable data structures in python so all you need to do is use string concatenation with list iteration.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Replace each item in the list with the <i>new</i> string or make a new list with the new strings.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">What's the point of  <code>while magician_names:         print(magician_names)         break</code> ? <code>print(magician_names)</code> does the same.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just updated the list with that code and it works. But whenever I try and run it in a function it comes back with an error saying "local variable: 'magician_names' referenced before assignment".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@drewmende I assume that <code>magician_names</code>, is not known in that function, but it's only a guess because I have no code. Maybe you can try to pass it to function as an argument.</span>
