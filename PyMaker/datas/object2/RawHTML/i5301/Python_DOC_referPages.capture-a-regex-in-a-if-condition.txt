<p>I would like to capture the match of my regex directly in my if condition. I know it was possible in PHP, but I don't know how to do it in a Pythonic way.
So I run it twice and it's not sexy at all...</p>
<pre><code>str = 'Test string 178-126-587-0 with a match'
if re.findall(r'[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]', str) != []:
    match = re.findall(r'[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]', str)[0]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can't do in-line variable assignment while using a conditional construct in Python, you need to leverage a temp variable. In your case, <code>re.search</code> would do as you are taking the first element anyway and there is no captured group:</p>
<pre><code>match_ = re.search(r'[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]', str_)
if match_:
    match = match_.group()
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>Regarding your original example, empty list is falsey in Python, so:</p>
<pre><code>if not some_list:
    # Do stuffs
</code></pre>
<p>would do.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">so you need only the 1st match?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks heemayl, but I don't get the ".group()" thing. Why not match[0] since there is only one match using search()?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Maxime  Unlike <code>re.findall</code>, <code>re.search</code> returns a match object, not a list. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#match-objects</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">All right, tkx!</span>
