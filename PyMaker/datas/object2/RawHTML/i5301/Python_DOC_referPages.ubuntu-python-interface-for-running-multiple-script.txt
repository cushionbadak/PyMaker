<p><p>I've created a few python scripts that I have to run every once in a while, but now I constantly have to type or search the location to the script in order to execute it. I have been looking for simple software to create an app with buttons, but without success.</p> <p>I have also seen "python?" scripts with an interface where you can select options with arrow keys, but also for this I have not found how it is done.</p> Is there anyone who knows how I can make one of these that I can open the interface and select the script I want to execute? It would really save me a lot of time.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Tkinter</a> to create the GUI, and for each button create a function that runs your python script like this:</p>
<pre><code># Create the button
button1 = Button \
    (root, text='Start script1!', command=lambda: script1())

def script1():
    os.system('python ~/path/to/script1.py')
def script2():
    os.system('python ~/path/to/script2.py')
</code></pre>

<p>I recommend using <a href="https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PyQt</a> because that framework is the powerful tool for building GUI on python and for running scripts from python code as system processes you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#module-subprocess" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess</a> module. I think you know how to use Google to find tutorials =) And also you can check the official page with GUI FAQ <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/gui.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. Thank you!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! I already came across Tkinter in my search, But I often ran into trouble. Thanks to some more youtube and your code I figured out how it works</span>
