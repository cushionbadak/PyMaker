<p>What and why it makes diffrence while using <strong>Patt_Search</strong> as <code>re.search(Patt_Search, line)</code> then it works  and <code>re.search('Patt_Search', line)</code> don't work , as i ran it and did not seen any error though.. it simply gets out..</p>
<p>Saying that, it works without the quote and don't work with quotes <code>''</code>.</p>
<p>The way it works as Below:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat Search_string_input.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
import re
File = input("Please Enter the File Name : ")
Patt_Search = input("Please Enter the Pattern you want to search : ")
ldap = open(File, mode='rt', encoding='utf-8')
for line in ldap:
    line = line.rstrip()
    #if re.search('12:00:16', line) :
    if re.search(Patt_Search, line) :
        print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>It works as below:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./Search_string_input.py
Please Enter the File Name : ldap_data
Please Enter the Pattren you want to serach : 12:00:16
Jan 31 12:00:16 test-1 automount[3432]: bind_ldap_simple: lookup(ldap): Unable to bind to the LDAP server: (default), error Can't contact LDAP server
Jan 31 12:00:16 test-2 automount[3544]: bind_ldap_simple: lookup(ldap): Unable to bind to the LDAP server: (default), error Can't contact LDAP server
Jan 31 12:00:16 hsv-ch02 automount[3006]: bind_ldap_simple: lookup(ldap): Unable to bind to the LDAP server: (default), error Can't contact LDAP server
</code></pre>
<p>The way it don't works as Below:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat Search_string_input.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
import re
File = input("Please Enter the File Name : ")
Patt_Search = input("Please Enter the Pattern you want to search : ")
ldap = open(File, mode='rt', encoding='utf-8')
for line in ldap:
    line = line.rstrip()
    #if re.search('12:00:16', line) :
    if re.search('Patt_Search', line) :
        print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>Result is as below, which don't yeild any output and no error though!</p>
<pre><code>$ ./Search_string_input.py
Please Enter the File Name : ldap_data
Please Enter the Pattren you want to serach : 06:10:13
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using <code>'Patt_Search'</code>, it just searches for the string literal <code>'Patt_Search'</code>. A string containing a variable name has nothing to do with the variable itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What is the purpose of this question? The first script apparently works as expected, so why not just use that?</p>
<p>In the second script, <code>'Patt_Search'</code> is a literal string, so <code>re.search('Patt_Search', line)</code> searches for the string <code>Patt_Search</code> in the input line. I'm guessing that your LDAP data file does not contain the string <code>Patt_Search</code> anywhere, hence there will not be any matches, and there will be no output nor any errors.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>in the first case you're passing your input <code>12:00:16</code>, which is found three times in the file and printed to the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>in the second case you're searching for the string <code>Patt_Search</code>, which can't be found in the file <code>ldap_data</code>, thus nothing gets printed to the screen. </p></li>

<span class="comment-copy">Okay, that makes sense and i's thinking the same!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there is pupose , either i'm unable to make it explicite or something, my intent of asking is , if i quote the variable <b>Patt_search</b> like <code>'Patt_search'</code> with <code>input</code> then it did not worked but at the same time if i use this variable <b>Patt_search</b>  without quotes with <code>input</code> function it works as expected taking the inputs from user.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">mhawke, secondly .. the though behind this is rather not hard-coding the values in the script i makeit dynamic using <code>if __name__ == main()</code> method and call this  into scripts or modules for more granularity.</span>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>'Patt_search'</code> has nothing to do with your variable <code>Patt_search</code>. It is an completely new string object you've creating through the quotes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I agree with  this @dabo, that was my doubt.</span>
