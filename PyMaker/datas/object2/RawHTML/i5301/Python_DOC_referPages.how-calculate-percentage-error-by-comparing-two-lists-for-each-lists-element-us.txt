<p>I have two lists, for example:</p>
<pre><code>a = [12, 0.2112, 0.2335, 4, 523, -0.55556, 0.212] # accepted value
b = [10, -0.0222, 0.5534, 4, 522, -0.99922, 0.877] # experimental value
</code></pre>
<p>I want to use this formula - <code>|accepted value(a[i]) - experimental value(b[i])| \ accepted value(a[i]) x 100%,</code> and get this result:</p>
<pre><code>c = [16.66, 110.51, 137.00, 0.00, 0.191, 78.59, 313.67]
</code></pre>
<p>How is it possible for two lists without numpy?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This can be accomplished with an ordinary loop</p>
<pre><code>c = [abs(i-j)/i*100 for i,j in zip(a,b)]
print(c)
</code></pre>
<p>If you have zeros in <code>a</code>, then you can skip these (while keeping the same length) by including an if-else statement:</p>
<pre><code>c = [abs(i-j)/i*100 if i != 0 else None for i,j in zip(a,b)]
print(c)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You can probably get unstuck by looking at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zip</a> function</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you mean that you want to iterate over <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> at the same time you can use the <code>zip</code> function</span>

<span class="comment-copy">btw, why is the 4th element in <code>c</code> is <code>100</code>? Shouldn't it be <code>0</code>? (Didn't check the rest)</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much! Is it List Comprehensions? I need to learn more... :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IluxaKuk it is indeed list comprehension.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If I will have zeros in data like this: a = [0,1,2,3,0,5], b= [2,5,8,0,4,7] ,I understand how to skip it:  c = abs(i-j)/i*100 for i,j in zip(a,b) if i !=0] but I get list like this  [400.0, 300.0, 100.0, 40.0], and can't save the same numbers of elements in output list,is it possible to do it? For example:    [ None, 400.0, 300.0, 100.0, None, 40.0]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IluxaKuk I've editted my answer so it includes what you're asking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great! It interesting, when I use &lt;is not&gt; operator for float type I have: " ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero". But when I use !=, everything works perfectly.</span>
