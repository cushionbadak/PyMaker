<p>I have a directory called my.directory and a file in it called file.py, I need to write a python script that uses file.py and I cannot change the names of the files or directories, moreover the script cannot be in the same directory as file.py. I have tried this:</p>
<pre><code>import my.directory.file
</code></pre>
<p>and this  </p>
<pre><code>import my\.directory.file
</code></pre>
<p>neither of which work, I would like to know if this is possible and if so how.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>I phrased the above question in a general way because I didn't think the particular details of the problem were important however here are the details anyway. I'm trying to import from python3.6/site-packages</p>

<p>You cannot have a dot in the module or package name under Python.</p>
<p>But you can execute any arbitrary python code dynamically under your namespace by doing::</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; exec(open("my.directory.file").read())
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Why canâ€™t you change the names of the files or directories? Do you actually need it as a module, or as a script?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need to import a module that I downloaded, I can't change the names of the directories because there are other scripts dependent on it and I don't want to have to change them all</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you can't move the module to a place python is aware of, instead make python aware of the location of the module.  The easiest way is probably to update your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> environment variable.

<span class="comment-copy">python3.6/site-packages? Is this a venv?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">does running the <b>init</b> file have the same effect as importing ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">only if the <code>init</code> initialise the rest of the package, i.e. it imports the sibling modules, otherwise no.</span>
