<p>Is it possible (in Python 3.6+) to have or implement dict comprehensions on a dict subclass, with the result being an instance of that subclass instead of a normal dict? Something like <code>CustomDict{k: v for k, v in list_of_tuples}</code>?</p>
<p>Is there any way at all to customize list/dict comprehensions?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your subclass can consume an iterable of 2-tuples:</p>
<pre><code>CustomDict((k, v) for k, v in list_of_tuples)
</code></pre>
<p>You can't use the language construct style <code>{...}</code> on your subclass, unless of course, you want to tweak some Python internals.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, that would work. I had never thought about a comprehension and its enclosing brackets as syntactically separate things, but it looks like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#displays-for-lists-sets-and-dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">they are</a>.</span>
