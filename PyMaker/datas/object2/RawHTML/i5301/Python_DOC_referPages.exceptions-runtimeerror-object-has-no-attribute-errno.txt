<p>I'm working with Maya 2018 and there's a weird thing going on. When I select multiple vertices, faces or edges I get:</p>
<pre><code>// Error: AttributeError: file &lt;string&gt; line 88: 'exceptions.RuntimeError' object has no attribute 'errno' // 
// Warning: Python callback failed // 
</code></pre>
<p>The problem with this in what I'm scripting is that when this warning/error appears, somehow it does not let me click on my custom GUI buttons.
For example. I need to select a few vertices then click a button to save them into a custom attribute... Well I can't click that button right away, and I'm guessing it is because of this weird error.</p>
<p>Any ideas on what this is? </p>

<p>In line 88 of your script you're trying to use attribute <code>errno</code> of <code>RuntimeError</code> instance but this exception class has no such attribute.<br/>
Read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation of exceptions</a> before trying to handle them.</p>
<p>Atrribute <code>errno</code> is defined only in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OSError</a> and classes inheriting from it.<br/>
So apparently line 88 is part of <code>try...except</code> clause and in that line you're trying to use <code>e.errno</code>. You can't do that if the exception doesn't belong to <code>OSError</code> exceptions family.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Well. I'm not using it at line 88....   my line 88 is: <code>code</code>( leftTableWidget = QWidget())   ... The documentation only says it is 'A numeric error code from the C variable errno' ... I get this might be a simple issue for you but you answer didn't really help how to solve it.... also there is no 'try except' in  my code...  where should i handle this error?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MendelReis the documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#OSError</a> describes <code>OSError</code> class and it's attribute <code>errno</code>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#RuntimeError</a> documentation doesn't mention attribute <code>errno</code> so it doesn't have it. Sometimes tools mess up the actual line numbers - please search for occurences of <code>errno</code> in your script and it would be the best if you could paste <code>try...except</code> block in which <code>errno</code> is used. Also does the traceback have only one line? If not, please include the traceback in your question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If there's no <code>try...except</code> block in your code, then the traceback should be longer than just <code>Error: AttributeError: file &lt;string&gt; line 88: 'exceptions.RuntimeError' object has no attribute 'errno' //</code> - please include the full traceback.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As far as my abilities let me understand, that is the whole trace back.. sorry.  Do you work with maya? here's git hub <a href="https://github.com/mreis/faceTweakRigger" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>  with the whole script. you can run it in maya 2017 or 2018 and see if you get the error when selecting vertices.   bit chances this is a silly thing indeed, but those silly things are the most annoying to beginners...  Thank you.</span>
