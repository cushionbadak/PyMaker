<p>I know I can store an exception name in a variable with this syntax:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    code
except TypeError as e:
    logger.error(e)
except NameError as e:
    logger.error(e)
</code></pre>
<p>How do I do the same for the generic <code>except:</code> message? I assume that this (which is the general idea) won't work:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    code
except as e:
    logger.error(e)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can you use type(e).__name__ to capture the name of any error you encounter, and access the message as you a normal variable, with e.message. All the built in errors (indexError, TypeError, etc.) are children of the class Exception, so they will be picked up. to save it as a variable named 'err':</p>
<pre><code>try:
   code
except Exception as e:
   err = type(e).__name__
   message = e.message
</code></pre>
<p>This will save the error type of any exception of the base python type Exception that you run into, using the built in __name__ variable</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>BaseException</code> is the broadest type you can catch:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    # some code
except BaseException as e:
    logger.error(e)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are able to catch <code>Exception</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import logging

try:
    code
except TypeError as e:
    logger.error(e)
except NameError as e:
    logger.error(e)
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(e)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Never try to catch a bare <code>except</code> as it will even stop catching rogue programs with CTRL-C.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Should I catch BaseException too (for built-in rather than user-defined exceptions), as another comment suggested?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you can read about it more in depth in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python docs</a>, but Exception will cover BaseException, as well as user created errors, which should be created as an Exception object. TL;DR: Exception will cover all built-in, non system exiting errors</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're handling them all the same way, you might as well just catch <code>Exception</code>, as it includes the others.</span>
