<p>I have a python script where I clone github repositories, and then I open the files that have a .py extension and put them all, into a different file, so I have one large file with all python scripts.</p>
<pre><code>languages = ['py', 'c']

    for lang in languages:
    files = glob.glob(filename + '/**/*.' + lang, recursive=True)
    outfile = open(filename + '/' + lang + '.data', 'w')

    print('processing {} {} files'.format(len(files), lang))

    for infile in files:
        with open(infile) as datafile:
            for line in datafile:
                line = line.rstrip()
                if line:
                    outfile.write(line + '\n')

<p>The error thrown is : </p>
<pre><code>in decode
return codecs.charmap_decode(input,self.errors,decoding_table)[0]
UnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x8f in position 7227: 
character maps to &lt;undefined&gt;.
</code></pre>
<p>Probably due to a file that has is encoded with a different standard.
Is there a way around this ?
My ultimate goal is to have one large python file with all the clones .py files, and .c file with all the clones c files.
So can I avoid the different encoded ones or is there a different way around this?</p>

<p>You can try to specify encoding when opening your files by using codecs.open:</p>
<pre><code>import codecs

outfile = codecs.open(filename + '/' + lang + '.data', 'w', encoding='utf8')
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>with codecs.open(infile, encoding='utf8') as datafile:
</code></pre>

<p>P.P.S. As you are using Python 3, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=open#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">you may just add an encoding argument to your existing open function</a> without importing codecs module:</p>
<pre><code>outfile = open(filename + '/' + lang + '.data', 'w', encoding='utf8')
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>with open(infile, encoding='utf8') as datafile:

<p>the file probably contains some data which is not a correct utf8. You should check which encoding do they have. It wil be harder to recover it once the files concatenated.</p>
<p>Otherwise, try adding parameter <code>error='surrogateescape'</code> to the open calls, both for reading and writing. This should preserve the byte values of the input, even if it is not a correct utf8.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. But I still get <code>UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe0 in position 21: invalid continuation byte</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe you could find the file in question and see whatâ€™s inside</span>
