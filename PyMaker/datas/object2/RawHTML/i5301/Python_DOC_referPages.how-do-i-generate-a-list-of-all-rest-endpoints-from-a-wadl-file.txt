<p>I have several wadl files from a web application, and I need to generate a list of all valid REST endpoint URLS from that wadl file.
I have tried using packages like wadlib, wadl2py and wadl2swagger, but they all give me errors saying the wadl file is not valid.</p>
<p>The file is being generated by jasper 2.</p>
<p>I need a list of all endpoint URLS and the valid methods/parameters for each endpoint.</p>
<p>Any tips would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Basicly these files are <strong>XML</strong> files.</p>
<p>So if the libraries didn't help you, you can try use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python XML modules</a> to handle as XML and you can check the specification <a href="https://github.com/javaee/wadl" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> or see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Application_Description_Language" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>I think that extracting the <strong>Resources names</strong> from theses files can be pretty simple if you have a good experience with Python.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
