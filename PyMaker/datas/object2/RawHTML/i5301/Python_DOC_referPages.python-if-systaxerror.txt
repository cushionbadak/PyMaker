<p>I have problem with this if.
I found I can use <code>in</code> in if-statement.</p>

<p>Syntax Error</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you don't show us the code surrounding the if-statement, we cannot know for sure what the problem is. If I were to make a guess however, I'd say you're missing a colon:</p>
<pre><code>if "log" in sys.argv[1:]:
</code></pre>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> for compound statements (like ifs):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each clause header begins with a uniquely identifying keyword and ends with a colon</p>

<span class="comment-copy">you are missing colon <code>:</code> at the end of <code>if</code> statement. Your line should be: <code>if "log" in sys.argv[1:]:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Dortik : In the error shown, the error location marker <code>^</code> is at the end of statement. That generally is indicative of this common error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, this is it I look hour to code where is mistake and you found it in 1 minute. Thanks you in advance</span>
