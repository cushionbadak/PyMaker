<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a lot of variables. Say for example, I wanted to print each variable everytime it was computed with. How would I do this. I will illustrate below:</p>
<pre><code>def mul(a,b):
    return a*b
a = mul(1,2)
b = mul(1,3)
c = mul(1,4)
b = mul(1,5)
</code></pre>
<p>How would I print so it displays both computations of b, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>a = 2
b = 3
c = 4
b = 5
</code></pre>
<p>Would I have to store the variables in a list and use a for loop? Quite new to python so I am unsure.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you store both variables in a list, you could use this idiom:</p>
<pre><code>def mul(x, y):
    return x * y

xs = [1,2,3,4,5]
ys = [10,20,30,40,50]

for args in zip(xs, ys):
    print "mul({}, {}) = {}".format(args[0], args[1], mul(*args))

mul(1, 10) = 10
mul(2, 20) = 40
mul(3, 30) = 90
mul(4, 40) = 160
mul(5, 50) = 250
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zip()</a> takes two lists, and returns a list of 2-tuples:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; zip(xs, ys) 
&gt;&gt;&gt; [(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30), (4, 40), (5, 50)]
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer">str.format()</a> takes a string, and injects the arguments you supply into the curly braces:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "hello {}".format('world')
&gt;&gt;&gt; "hello world"
</code></pre>
