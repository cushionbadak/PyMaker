<p>Octave has a <code>keyboard</code> function that stops the execution of the script and drops you out into an interactive octave shell, so it is possible to inspect variables at that point and carry our other debugging actions. </p>
<p>Is there anything similar in python?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strike>Yes. But you must use the <code>-i</code> option when running the script:</strike></p>
<pre><code>python -i my_script.py
</code></pre>
<h3>Edit</h3>
<p>Actually, you are looking for the python debugger, <code>pdb</code>. So you must:</p>
<pre><code>import pdb

# some code
my_var = 1
pdb.set_trace()
print(my_var)
</code></pre>
<p>And this will drop you into the python debugger. It is quite a broad topic, best to start with reading the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>pdb is the correct answer for debugging, but sometimes it's nice to have the regular REPL:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import code
&gt;&gt;&gt; code.interact(local=locals())
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Does Python support <code>return</code> from the main thread? or something akin to <code>EXIT /B</code> from <code>cmd</code>?  If it does, those would be more appropriate answers to the OP.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So, if I run my script with -i flag, what do I have to do in order to exit to  python shell after "my_var=1" line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TheIncorrigible1 I'm not sure what you mean. I am not familiar with <code>cmd</code>, but how would that open an interactive shell?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@facha ah, then you must use the python debugger, i.e. <code>import pdb;</code> then <code>pdb.set_trace()</code> after your line.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Great. Just what I needed. Thanks a lot.</span>
