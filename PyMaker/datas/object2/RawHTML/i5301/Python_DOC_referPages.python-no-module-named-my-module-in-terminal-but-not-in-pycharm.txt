<p>I have a python script that i'm trying to run.
When i run it from within PyCharm it runs without a problem, but when i run it through the terminal using:</p>
<p><code>python my_script.py</code></p>
<p>i get:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "folder/folder/my_script.py", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
    from my_module import me1, me2, me3
ImportError: No module named my_module
</code></pre>
<p>What could be the problem?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The PYTHONPATH in your terminal environment doesn't contain 'my_module'.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html?highlight=pythonpath#envvar-PYTHONPATH" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Configure the PYTHONPATH to include the directory containing your module</a></p>
<p>It works in pycharm because it sets up the path for you automagically.</p>

<p>Another reason might be you had started your project in pycharm with virtual enviroment. </p>
<p>If it is the case go to your projects <code>venv\Scripts</code> folder via your terminal and run <code>activate.bat</code> .</p>
<p>You will see "(venv)" on leftmost in your terminal line. Then go to your project folder and run</p>
<p><code>python my_script.py</code></p>
<p>Now it should work.  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">One possible explanation is that you are running different versions of python in terminal and in pycharm.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">do you have <b>init</b>.py in your module? can you post your directory structure here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Both are running the same version of python. I have <code>init.py</code> in the module, and i'll post the directory structure in a bit.</span>
