<p>I'm trying to read a file then create an exact copy of it this way, I'm doing</p>
<pre><code>f = open("new.mp3", "rb")
n = open("new2.mp3", "w")
n.write(f.read())
</code></pre>
<p>and, for some reason, when I try to run this, running <code>new2.mp3</code>mp3 won't play, it refuses to start, but <code>new.mp3</code> is fine</p>

<p>If copying the file is all you want, is there any reason why you can't simply use shutil? You can use a high level function like shutil.copy2(source, dest):</p>
<pre><code>import shutil
shutil.copy2("new.mp3", "new2.mp3")
</code></pre>
<p>Anyway, if you insist on doing it your way, you need to open new2 in write binary mode.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>b</code> for binary matters on output too (although you can get away with not using it in Python 2 on POSIX systems).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">copy2</a> function tries to do a lot more than simply copy the file's data (which may not be what is wanted). The equivalent of the OPs original code would be <code>shutil.copyfile("new.mp3", "new2.mp3", follow_symlinks=False)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Granted, but is there a reason why op wouldn't want that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For example, if the original file was read-only, would you usually want the copy to be as well? And what about the creation/modification date? Sometimes it makes more sense for the copy to have the current date (e.g. for the purposes of revision history and such like).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's a valid point actually, which is why I explained what's wrong with his code just in case. Also, main reason why I suggested copy2 instead of copyfile is because copy2 will copy if destination is a directory but copyfile wonâ€™t. Tho I now understand that might not be of significant importance to op.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's nothing wrong with it - I was just pointing out (for the benefit of future users), that <code>copy2</code> is not the same as simply copying the file contents into a new file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">removing "b" made the file smaller than it should be and it won't run, using "rb" made the file the same length but still wouldn't run</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Hugh: What I mean is that you need <code>wb</code>!</span>
