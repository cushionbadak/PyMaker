<p>I am trying to run the below code:-</p>

    with open("sp500tickers.pickle","wb") as f:
        pickle.dump(tickers, f)
    print(tickers)
#   return tickers
# save_sp500_tickers()
</code></pre>
<p>it does not throws any error but i realized pickle module is not installed.
I went to install it via pip and getting below error:-</p>
<pre><code>D:\py_fin&gt;pip install pickle
Collecting pickle
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pickle (from versions:
 )
No matching distribution found for pickle
</code></pre>
<p>I tried google'd about it but did not get a solution. Please help.
How do we install pickle in python 3.6(32-bit)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>pickle</code> module</a> is part of the standard library in Python for a very long time now so there is no need to install it via <code>pip</code>. I wonder if you IDE or command line is not messed up somehow so that it does not find python installation path. Please check if your <code>%PATH%</code> contains a path to python (e.g. <code>C:\Python36\</code> or something similar) or if your IDE correctly detects root path where Python is installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import pickle

intArray = [i for i in range(1,100)]
output = open('data.pkl', 'wb')
pickle.dump(intArray, output)
output.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Test your pickle quickly. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/pickle.html" rel="noreferrer">pickle</a> is a part of standard python library and available by default.  </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can pip install pickle by running command <code>pip install pickle-mixin</code>.
Proceed to import it using <code>import pickle</code>.
This can be then used normally.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Pickle is a module installed for both Python 2 and Python 3 by default. See the standard library for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">3.6.4</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">2.7</a>.  </p>
<p>Also to prove what I am saying is correct try running this script:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle
print(pickle.__doc__)
</code></pre>
<p>This will print out the Pickle documentation showing you all the functions (and a bit more) it provides.  </p>
<p>Or you can start the integrated Python 3.6 Module Docs and check there. </p>
<p>As a rule of thumb: if you can import the module without an error being produced then it is installed</p>
<p>The reason for the <code>No matching distribution found for pickle</code> is because libraries for included packages are not available via pip because you already have them (I found this out yesterday when I tried to install an integrated package).   </p>
<p>If it's running without errors but it doesn't work as expected I would think that you made a mistake somewhere (perhaps quickly check the functions you are using in the docs).  Python is very informative with it's errors so we generally know if something is wrong.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Did you happen to name a file pickle.py? This will overwrite the pickle lib...</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try using <code>pip install pickle</code> using pip or <code>conda install pickle</code> in the anaconda environment.</p>
