<p>I have two variables holding the ouputs from using <code>subprocess</code> output and want the output of the both variable to be printed into one line..
below is the details..</p>
<pre><code>cmd1=subprocess.Popen("some_command", shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
cmd_input1=cmd1.stdout.read().decode('utf8')

cmd_input1 has:

one
two
three
four


cmd2=subprocess.Popen("othere_command", shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
cmd_input2=cmd2.stdout.read().decode('utf8')

while cmd_input2 has :
1
2
3
4
</code></pre>
<p>I need the print output of both the variables into one line, line below..</p>
<pre><code>one   1
two   2
three 3
four  4
</code></pre>
<p>I tried below but not working.. i just started learning python..</p>
<pre><code>print("%  %." % (cmd_input1, cmd_input2)
</code></pre>
<p>Its python3 , please guide..</p>

<p>You may want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zip()</a> built-in function to mix two lists and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=split#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">split()</a> to split the output to lists of strings.</p>
<p>Zip will make a list of tuples:</p>
<pre><code>[('one', 1), ('two', 2), ('three', 3), ('four', 4)]
</code></pre>
<p>Then you'll need to print it out. Here's the full code:</p>
<pre><code>zipped = zip(cmd_input1.split('\n'), cmd_input2.split('\n'))
for line in zipped:
    print(line[0], line[1])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can iterate over both outputs simultaneously by splitting them into lines and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">zip</a>ping them:</p>
<pre><code>for out1, out2 in zip(cmd_input1.splitlines(), cmd_input2.splitlines()):
    print(out1.ljust(5), out2)
</code></pre>
<p>I also used <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.ljust" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.ljust</code></a> to align the output.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">try.. <code>print(cmd_input1,  str(cmd_input2))</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">not working,  still printing the output into one after another not into one line as expected</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ababak, thx for the great input, that works nice, but it looks like if there are missing value in the cmd_input2 then its taking the next number joining into the cmd_input, would be great to suggest on this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well, zip will aggregate elements from each of the lists one by one and it will stop when any of the lists are over. I am not sure what do you mean when you say missing values.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok, i understand i'll  raise another Question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">great ans indeed anx for the solution but it looks like if there are missing value in the cmd_input2 then its taking the next number joining into the cmd_input, would be great to suggest on this</span>
