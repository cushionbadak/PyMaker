<p>I have a variable that can sometimes have a value of -0.0, and I want to change its value to 0.0 whenever this is the case.</p>
<p>The problem is, I can't find a nice way to check if it has a value of -0.0! </p>
<p>I can't use something like:</p>
<pre><code>if a == -0.0:
  a = 0.0
</code></pre>
<p>because a can have other values like False (and False == -0.0).</p>
<p>I thought if I used is, then that would work, but <strong>-0.0 is -0.0</strong> is false!</p>
<p>Another idea I had was to try: </p>
<pre><code>if str(a) == '-0.0':
  a = 0.0
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this is also problematic because a can have a value of '-0.0', which I want to keep as a string.</p>
<p>So, right now I can only think of doing:</p>
<pre><code>if not isinstance(a, str) and str(a) == '-0.0':
   a = 0.0
</code></pre>
<p>which is pretty crazy considering what I want to do...</p>
<p>Does anyone know of any better ways to do this? Thanks so much for the help! :) </p>

<p>You could also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">abs()</a> which outputs the absolute value:</p>
<pre><code>if type(a) is float and abs(a) == 0:
    a = abs(a)
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, a check for <code>a == -0.0</code> becomes unnecessary.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>if type(a) is float and a == -0.0</code></p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>elaborating on previous answers, the simplest way would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>check type</li>
<li>check if equals 0.0</li>
</ul>
<p>and in that case set to <code>0.0</code>, we don't care if a is <code>-0.0</code> or <code>0.0</code>, force <code>0.0</code> in all cases</p>
<pre><code>if isinstance(a,float) and not a:
   a = 0.0
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You could simply add <code>0.0</code> to your float (assuming that you have a float): this converts <code>-0.0</code> to <code>0.0</code>, and has no effect on any other value. Alternatively, look into <code>math.copysign</code>. (Obligatory disclaimer: this assumes IEEE 754 format and semantics, but that's a safe assumption in practice.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can check the type of your value: <code>if isinstance(a, float) and a==-0.0 ...</code> That makes much more sense than doing a string conversion</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how about <code>np.abs</code>? (np.abs(-0.0)=0.0)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>math.copysign(1,a)</code>. returns -1 if a==-0.0 as Mark hinted.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">will not work in the case the op specified - when  <code>a = False</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">how this perfect if this did not handle one of the problem you suggested - when <code>a = False</code> ???</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ddor254 a simple type check would do the trick.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">of course it will do the trick, it is not in your answer and that is why i wrote the comment :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added the type check though I thought this is not rocket science.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would continue on this answer. Note that <code>a==0.0</code> is okay too, then set to 0.0</span>
