<p>I have a simple Python programm. This programm contains two functions, that can be called by using programm.function_1() from a second programm. If a user types package.function_01() the attribute error 'module not found' comes up. I want to except that error and call the function help(). </p>
<p>Where do I have to insert my try - except routine to handle the attribute error?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Surround the code that can break with a <code>try ... except</code> block. You may call your Exception handler under the <code>except SomeException:</code> clause </p>
<p>Take a look into Python exception docs <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enter link description here</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you at least provide an example? It will enable us to understand your question better.</span>
