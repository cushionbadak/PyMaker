<p>Strings can be iterated through, and when you do iterate through one, it will spin through each individual letter.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.join(iterable)</code></a> will join the iterable inside the brackets together using the string outside the brackets.</p>
<p>If the iterable was a list, it'd be easy to see what is going on</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ["Alice", "Ben", "Casey"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; ", ".join(l)
"Alice, Ben, Casey"
</code></pre>
<p>And with a string,</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; "-".join("Hello!")
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Same as "-".join(["H", "e", "l", "l", "o", "!"])
"H-e-l-l-o-!"
</code></pre>

<p>String is a sequence of characters. Join function concatenates the sequence (iterable) to a new string by joining them on the string you called the function on. In this case it's s with value of 'HI'.</p>
<p>Its not different than:</p>
<pre><code>print(" ".join("hello", "world"))
</code></pre>
<p>That results in "hello world".</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The thing is, <code>string.join</code> receives a iterable as a parameter, so the string you are passing it, will be treated as a iterable and not a string, so you will do <code>b</code>, joined with <code>y</code> joined with <code>e</code>. If you do <code>s.join(['bye'])</code>, then the output will be the one I assume you were expecting</p>

<span class="comment-copy">A string is an <i>iterable</i> of strings: 1-char strings that are the characters, so you <code>join</code> <code>HI</code> between the characters of <code>'bye'</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Pleas don't post screenshots of your code; post the text itself.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>'HI'</code> is placed between every character in <code>'bye'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sure you read the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=join#str.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation for <code>join</code></a>, so what part of it do you not understand?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">were you looking for <code>+</code> operator in Python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The string isn't casted into an iterable, a string <i>is</i> an iterable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good catch, I've edited the post.</span>
