<p>I'm using python socket module, and I read that you can use either 2 or 3 arguments when using <code>socket.sendto()</code> command. you can specify address and message, but you can also send flags. 
I was wondering what these flags are? I couldn't find any information about it. what happens when you send them? what is the default value? (when you don't specify a flag) what do they do?</p>
<p>Thanks in advanced, sorry for the weird question, I just couldn't find it online.</p>

<p>As the Python documentation says, you have to go to <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/sendto" rel="nofollow noreferrer">man pages</a> for this information.  (The flags should be variables in the <code>socket</code> module with the same names that they have in C.)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Went there, though I didn't understand quite what the use is, it seems quite random.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IdoKadosh: They are important in special use cases, but yes: thereâ€™s a reason the default is not to use any.</span>
