<p>This code looks like it should be invalid, but python 2.7 seems to accept it as valid:</p>
<pre><code>sf[(sf['id'] &gt;= 1) &amp; (sf['id'] &lt;= 2)]
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>sf</code> is an <code>SFrame</code> object, and <code>sf['id']</code> refers to a column of the <code>SFrame</code>.</p>
<p>This operation results in an SFrame containing only rows for which the expression in the square brackets is true.</p>
<p>Note: I am asking for a python feature, such as a 'list comprehension', 'generator', etc. rather than a feature of SFrame.</p>
<p>This line of code is used an example in the <a href="https://turi.com/products/create/docs/generated/graphlab.SFrame.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation for graphlab.SFrame</a> in the section titled <code>Logical Filters</code>.  </p>

<p>The answer is: Operator overloading.  </p>
<p>This was especially confusing as this snippet of code makes use of several overloaded operators: <code>[ ... ]</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, and <code>&amp;</code>.</p>
<p>In this case, it looks like <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code> and <code>&gt;=</code> were overloaded to do a per-element comparison and return a list of 1's and 0's, and <code>[ ... ]</code> was overloaded to accept a list of 1's and 0's. </p>

<p>Python's booleans are simply subclasses of int. True is equivalent to 1, and False to 0.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@StephenRauch: Thanks for sharing the link, that question does appear to be similar, however it is asking a "how" question related to numpy, while I intended a "what" question about python.</span>
