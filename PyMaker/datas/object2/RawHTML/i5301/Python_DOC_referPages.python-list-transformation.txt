<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list in the following format</p>
<pre><code>[Data(Id=1, value='abc', ratio= 0.1),
Data(Id=2, value='def', ratio= 0.3),
Data(Id=3, value='ghi', ratio= 0.15),
Data(Id=4, value='xyz', ratio= 0.5)]
</code></pre>
<p>I wonder if there is a pythonic way to transform this list to a list of tuples like below</p>
<pre><code>[(1, 'abc', 0.1), (2,'def',0.3), (3,'ghi',0.15), (4, 'xyz',0.5)] 
</code></pre>
<p>I know I can parse each element in the list, but that would be very inefficient, I am looking for a pythonic way with maybe a couple of simple lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming the objects are <code>collections.namedtuples</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import namedtuple
Data = namedtuple('Data', ['Id', 'value', 'ratio'])
s = [Data(Id=1, value='abc', ratio= 0.1), Data(Id=2, value='def', ratio= 0.3), Data(Id=3, value='ghi', ratio= 0.15), Data(Id=4, value='xyz', ratio= 0.5)]
new_s = [(i.Id, i.value, i.ratio) for i in s]
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[(1, 'abc', 0.1), (2, 'def', 0.3), (3, 'ghi', 0.15), (4, 'xyz', 0.5)]
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>[(d.Id, d.value, d.ratio) for d in data]</code></p>
<p><code>data</code> being your list.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the <code>Data</code> class or function? You need to give complete details in a question like this. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"I know I can parse each element in the list, but that would be very inefficient" ... what other choice do you believe you'd have?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Concur with @juanpa.arrivillaga, there is no way to avoid a loop here. Yet in the space of 10 mins we have 3 identical answers which do just this!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If they were <code>namedtuples</code>, wouldn't they already <i>be</i> tuples?  If so, isn't this an XY problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SethMMorton <code>namedtuples</code> are not tuples, but a subclass of the tuples.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Of course. But they behave just like tuples. I have a hard time imagining a situation where you needed a tuple and a namedtuple wouldn't also work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks,  this is what I am looking for</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you assuming that <code>Data</code> is a named tuple?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RoryDaulton Yes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">while this might work, there is no way to know from the code given if the <code>Data</code> class has those fields...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Julien True, but in that case the question can't be answered without knowing the details of the <code>Data</code> class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then maybe ask for clarification before answering... :)</span>
