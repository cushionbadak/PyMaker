<p>Like this: Your Target Heart Rate zone is: (125, 144) beats per minute</p>
<p>I know that this is a duple, but not how to avoid this.
Anyone know how to fix?</p>
<pre><code>def target (rate):
    print "Please indicate your exercise objective as follows"
    print "1 = weight loss, building endurance"
    print "2 = weight management, improving cardio fitness "
    print "3 = interval workouts"

    zone = int(raw_input("input your objective: ")) 
    if zone == 1:
        down = int(rate * .6)
        up = int(rate * .7)
        print down, up
        return down, up
    elif zone == 2:
        down = int(rate * .7)
        up = int(rate * .8)
        return down, up
    elif zone == 3:
        down = 0
        up = int(rate * .8)
        return down, up
print "This program calculates Maximum Heart Rate (MHR)  and preferred 
Target Heart Rate (THR) Zones "
print

age = int(raw_input("Please input your age: "))

mhr = 220-age

thr = target(mhr)

print "Your Target Heart Rate zone is: ", thr,  " beats per minute"
</code></pre>
<p>The solution should be : </p>
<pre><code>Your Target Heart Rate zone is: # - # beats per minute
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's actually a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tuple</a>.</p>
<p>To print it more pleasantly you'll want to format the two numbers individually.</p>
<pre><code>print "Your Target Heart Rate zone is: ", thr[0], "-", thr[1],  " beats per minute"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is the way Python prints <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tuples</a>.</p>
<h3>Here's how to get the output you want:</h3>
<p>You can get each element of your tuple with the square brackets operator:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>thr[0]</code> is the first value</li>
<li><code>thr[1]</code> is the second value</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then concatenate those values to your string, like this:</p>
<pre><code>print "Your Target Heart Rate zone is: " + thr[0] + " - " + thr[1] +  " beats per minute"
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">A possible solution: return a string where you concatenate down, " - " and up. It does make it less flexible of a solution, though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are returning a tuple in the <code>target</code> function. So what did you expect? How about changing the print to <code>"Your Target Heart Rate zone is between ", thr[0]," and ", thr[1],  " beats per minute"</code> ?</span>
