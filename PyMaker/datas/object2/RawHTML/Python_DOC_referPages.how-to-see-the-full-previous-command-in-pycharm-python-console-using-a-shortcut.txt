<p>I was wondering how I could see the history in the Pycharm Python console using a shortcut. I can see the history using the upper arrow key, but If I want to go further back in history I have to go to each individual line if more lines are ran at the time. Is it possible that each time I press a button the full previous commands that are ran are shown?</p>
<p>I don't want to search in history, I want to go back in history similar using arrow up key but each time I enter arrow up I want to see the previous full code that was ran.</p>

<p>Go to preferences -&gt; Appereance &amp; Behaviour -&gt; Keymap. You can search for "Browse Console History" and add a keyboard shortcut with right click -&gt; Add Keyboard shortcut.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, that almost does the job but now I have to press minimal three times a button to run a full command in the history CTRL ALT E + Arrow Up + Enter + Enter, I was hoping for a shortcut that combines the first three shortcuts, which is the case in for example Spyder if I press arrow up</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can achieve this by binding a keyboard shortcut to a macro. See <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-macros-in-the-editor.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a></span>
