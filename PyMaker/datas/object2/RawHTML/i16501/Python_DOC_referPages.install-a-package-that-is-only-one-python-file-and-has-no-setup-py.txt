<p>How can i install a python package that does <strong>not</strong> have a <code>setup.py</code> file to call. I want to install a package that it happens to be only a <code>.py</code>. </p>
<p>Do i just save it as a <code>.py</code> and put it somewhere in the directory and then import it?</p>
<p>For example the <a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Lib/zipfile.py" rel="nofollow">zipfile package</a> and the <a href="http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Lib/xml/etree/ElementTree.py" rel="nofollow">ElementTree XML parser</a></p>
<p>P.S.: I have Python-3.x</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> As said in the comments, these packages come with Python 3 so you should not install them manually (and certainly not the 2.7 versions). I let my answer bellow for people wanting to install custom package.</p>
<p>On a python interpreter, if you run:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.path
</code></pre>
<p>You will see a list of folder where your python executable search for module. You can put your file either in the <code>site-packages</code> folder or the <code>lib</code> folder.</p>

<p>Just put the file somewhere in PYTHONPATH.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Python 3 <i>comes with both those modules already</i>. You don't need to install those. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html</a>. Do <i>not</i> install the Python 2 versions into Python 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you on that tip! Are there editions existant for those two modules for Python 3?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, and they are <i>already included</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you Mr Pieters</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice Mr Holt i will test now!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can i please ask if those two packages are suitable for Python 3.x?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The packages may contain lot of compatibilities errors with python 3.0. As Martijn said in comment, these packages come with python 3 so you don't need (and you should not) install them manually.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have untied my hands you people. Thank you so much!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> of the <code>Path</code> environmental variable?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Doesn't it have to be on the <code>C:\Python33\Lib\site-packages</code> file ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A <code>site-packages</code> directory is in Windows PATH, so you can put the file right there.</span>
