<p>I'll preface this by admitting I'm very new to Python.  I have a directory of files that I would like to see all the possible combinations.  I've located a script that can concatenate one set list of files but I would like to see all the possible combinations of these files have them concatenated and save them as a jpg.  To make things more complicated I have two specific files that I always want at the beginning of all combinations and one specific file that I always want at the end.  </p>
<p>Slapping some code I found from a similar question together I've come up with the below which obviously isn't going to to cut it.</p>
<pre><code>files = ['File1.txt', 'Filet2.txt']

with open('CombinedFile.jpg', 'w') as result:
        for file_ in files:
            for line in open(file_, 'r'):
                result.write(line)
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT:  I realized I may not have articulated the question well enough I would like to combine the contents of the file per below:</p>
<p>Combine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>File1.txt Contents</p>
<p>File2.txt Contents</p>
<p>File3.txt Contents</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Output Result:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CombinationFile.jpg </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then again with the files in different order until all possible combinations have been run.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you mean <code>permutation</code> saying <code>combination</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import itertools

files = ['File1.txt', 'File2.txt', 'File3.txt']

it = itertools.permutations(files, len(files))

for x in it:
     print x
</code></pre>
<p>result</p>
<pre><code>('File1.txt', 'File2.txt', 'File3.txt')
('File1.txt', 'Filt3.txt', 'File2.txt')
('File2.txt', 'File1.txt', 'File3.txt')
('File2.txt', 'File3.txt', 'File1.txt')
('File3.txt', 'File1.txt', 'File2.txt')
('File3.txt', 'File2.txt', 'File1.txt')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you already have a list of all the filenames?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When you say "save them as a jpg", do you mean "a text file containing text that happens to have the .jpg extension", or "a jpg file, which can be viewed as an image, which contains a visual representation of the contents of the given files"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If it's the latter, this post might work better if separated into multiple posts: 1, "how do I get all possible combinations of a sequence of items?", 2, "how do I get the concatenated contents of a sequence of files?" and 3, "How do I draw text on an image and save it as a jpg?"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In any case, check out <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html?highlight=itertools#itertools.permutations" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.permutations</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry I should have been a bit more specific the content of the text files is jpg hex data that I'm trying to brute force back into a viewable image.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A <code>Filet</code> instead of a <code>File</code>? :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In comments he said <code>1, "how do I get all possible combinations of a sequence of items?"</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">But SO said <code>I've located a script that can concatenate one set list of files but I would like to see all the possible combinations of these files</code> - so more importat for SO is to get combinations of filenames.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ Christian Berendt - in question is <code>files = ['File1.txt', 'Filet2.txt']</code> and I used it so I had <code>Filet</code> :)</span>
