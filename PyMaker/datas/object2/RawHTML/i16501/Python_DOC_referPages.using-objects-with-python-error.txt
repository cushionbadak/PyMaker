<p>Hey guys am new to python development..The code which i have made</p>
<pre><code>class Employee:
   def __init__(self, num, num1):
       self.num = num
       self.num1 = num1

   def displayCount(self,x,y):
       d = x.self.num
       p = y.self.num1
       c = d + p
       print c
</code></pre>
<p>When I call the function like </p>
<pre><code>emp1 = Employee(3, 2000)
emp1.displayCount(3, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>It gives me error like <code>AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'self'</code>.I know the error is with <code>x.self.num</code>.Why this can be done with python ??..</p>
<p>Hope you guys can help me out ..thanks</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If the attribute of the class is an instance of an other class it could look like this.</p>
<pre><code>class Location:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 0
        self.y = 0

class Person:
    def __init__(self):
        self.loc = Location()

    def set_coordinates(self, x_pos, y_pos):
        self.loc.x = x_pos
        self.loc.y = y_pos

p = Person()
p.set_coordinates(23, 42)
print(p.loc.x)
</code></pre>
<p><code>set_coordinates</code> accesses <code>self.loc</code>. This is an instance of <code>Location</code>and so we can go further in the hierarchy and access <code>self.loc.x</code>.</p>
<p>After a lot of discussion in the comments I'll show some real bad code that shows how something like <code>variable.self.anothervar</code> is possible.</p>
<pre><code>class Foo:
    pass

class Bar:
    def __init__(this):
        this.self = Foo()
        this.self.value = 23

class Baz:
    def print_value(this, x):
        print(x.self.value)

baz = Baz()
baz.print_value(Bar())
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, there is nothing special about <code>self</code>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#random-remarks" rel="nofollow">The usage of <code>self</code> is just a naming convention</a>.</p>

<p>I assume that with your <code>x.self.num</code> you are trying to update <code>self.num</code>. If you are not, please specify your error in your question.</p>
<p>To fix the above, you can just reassign using <code>self.num = x</code>:</p>
<pre><code>class Employee:

   def __init__(self, num, num1):
       self.num = num
       self.num1 = num1




   def displayCount(self,x,y):
       self.num = x
       self.num1 = y
       c = self.num+self.num1
       print c
</code></pre>
<p>Which runs as:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; emp1 = Employee(3, 2000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; emp1.displayCount(3,2)
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What exactly are you trying to accomplish with <code>x.self.num</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ZenOfPython i have seen a code like doing with x.self.num ..can it be done in python ??..if it can be done like that please post an answer showing an example</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where is that code? And why are you using <code>x.self.num</code>? Is it to update <code>self.num</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your question is unclear, because your definition of <code>displayCount</code> is cryptic. Are the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> you pass to <code>displayCount</code> of type <code>Employee</code> or are they meant to be some other type?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexReynolds i just want to know how can i add like self.onevaribale.anothervaribale</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no no ..i know how to do this ..but my question is can we add a third varibale like x.self.num ??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3805325 What do you think <code>x.self</code> and <code>self.x</code> mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">suppose its like self.name = "somename" ..i want to do like self.name.x = "somename" ..can this be done in python ??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes it can be done. But I don't get what you <b>really</b> want to do. You don't understand object oriented programming yet and try to do things that are ... strange.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matthias please post an example on how to do it ..it would be helpful ..i just want to know in which case we want to add like self.x.anothervariable ..</span>
