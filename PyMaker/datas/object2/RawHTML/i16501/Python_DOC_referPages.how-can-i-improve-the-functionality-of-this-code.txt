<p>Use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set" rel="nofollow">set</a>:</p>
<pre><code>a1 = input("Enter an 8 bit  binary number to convert: ")

if set(a1) &lt;= set('01'):
    print("Number is binary!")
</code></pre>
<p>This will only be true if <code>set(a1)</code> is a subset of <code>set('01')</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; set('10011') &lt;= set('01')
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; set('10011abc') &lt;= set('01')
False
</code></pre>
<p>You can also just use exceptions (and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow"><code>int()</code></a> to do the binary -&gt; integer conversion):</p>
<pre><code>try:
    n1 = int(a1, 2)
except ValueError:
    print("Not binary")
else:
    print("Number is binary")
    print("Denary number is: {}".format(n1))
</code></pre>
<p>This has the added advantage of converting your binary input to an integer in one step.</p>
<p>If you don't want or can use <code>int()</code>, convert back with a loop and use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#shifting-operations" rel="nofollow"><code>&lt;&lt;</code> left-shift</a> for each binary digit, and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#binary-bitwise-operations" rel="nofollow"><code>|</code> binary bitwise OR</a> to add the new digit:</p>
<pre><code>n1 = 0
for digit in a1:
    n1 = (n1 &lt;&lt; 1) | (1 if digit == '1' else 0)
</code></pre>
<p>This is rather a round-about way to get the number, but at least you are using binary logic now.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do it using the <code>all()</code> method in python:</p>
<pre><code>a1 = raw_input("Enter an 8 bit  binary number to convert: ")

print all(i in ('0','1') for i in a1)

<span class="comment-copy">Please don't just dump code. Do add an explanation as to what the code is supposed to do!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry I thought it might be obveus enough from the input at the top of the code my apologise</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This looks like you are doing homework, so I made the assumption you cannot use <code>int()</code> or similar restrictions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">no, it's not homework I was just wondering about how to make the code as short and sweet as possible so when it comes to exams i have a good idea I chose this as it is most relevant to something that i could practice (binary)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so would that answer any in put of binary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rosco, Yes. It validates any length binary</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well thank you very much then it won't let me accept you answer yet, but I will when I can thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rosco, In all fairness, Martijn's answer is much more informative and simple</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok I do agree i have just read through his i didnt understand it at first</span>
