<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have the following code:</p>
<pre><code>list1 = [4,1,2,6]
for elem in sorted(list1):
    #some task
</code></pre>
<p>I was wondering how many times does Python sort the list using the <code>sorted()</code> method? Is it for each iteration or just once?</p>
<p>In other words is the following code more efficient?</p>
<pre><code>list1 = [4,1,2,6]
list1 = sorted(list1)
for elem in list1:
    #some task 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In both code examples, the list is sorted only once.  </p>
<p>The expression on the right of the <code>in</code> operator in a for-loop header is evaluated just once, before looping commences. You can read about this in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#for" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>for_stmt ::=  "for" target_list "in" expression_list ":" suite
              ["else" ":" suite]</pre>
<p><strong>The expression list is evaluated once</strong>; it should yield an iterable
  object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, the second code example is <em>less</em> efficient because there is an unnecessary assignment.</p>
