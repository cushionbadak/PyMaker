<p>Hello I have a list that I wish to insert into a dictionary - however not each element a new element in the dictionary - the list itself is 2 items long and should be used as "key-value" pair.</p>
<p>Or (as knowing python there are dozens of ways to do something so maybe this isn't even necessary). The base problem is that I wish to split a string into 2 parts around a delimiter and use the left as "key" and the right as "value":</p>
<pre><code>for line in file:
    if "=" in line:
        tpair = line.split("=",1)
        constantsMap.update(tpair)
</code></pre>
<p>Of course I could do a manual split like:</p>
<pre><code>for line in file:
    if "=" in line:
        p = line.find("=")
        constantsMap[line[:p]] = line[p+1:]
</code></pre>
<p>But that doesn't seem to be idiomaticcally "python", so I was wondering if there's a more clean way?</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences" rel="nofollow">sequence unpacking</a> here:</p>
<pre><code>key,val = line.split("=", 1)
constantsMap[key] = val
</code></pre>
<p>See a demonstration below:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; line = "a=1"
&gt;&gt;&gt; constantsMap = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; key,val = line.split("=", 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; constantsMap[key] = val
&gt;&gt;&gt; constantsMap
{'a': '1'}
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">ps: already answered (waiting for time) - but care to explain the downvote?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If the answer is simple, some people downvote with the attitude of "why couldn't you think of that?"  They forget though that in Python, everything is simple. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"everything is simple"  and in the process python became terribly complex to me.  8086 Assembly is simple - there's only so many opcodes to consider.</span>
