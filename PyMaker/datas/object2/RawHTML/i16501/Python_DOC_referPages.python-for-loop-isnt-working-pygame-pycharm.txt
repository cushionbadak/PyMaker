<p>I'm new to programming and I'm currently writing a game using pygame and pycharm.</p>
<p>I need to scale some images down from their original size and I can get it just fine by typing them all out 1 at a time but when I try and shorten the code using a for loop it doesn't work.</p>
<pre><code>    numbers = [num0_img, num1_img, etc...]
    for image in numbers:
        image = scale(image, (15, 15))
</code></pre>
<p>Doesn't scale the images down. But typing it all out works. </p>
<pre><code>    num0_img = scale(num0_img, (15, 15))
    num1_img = scale(num1_img, (15, 15))
    etc...
</code></pre>
<p>Can anyone help me out here?</p>
<p>Also just a note. I have imported it correctly. </p>
<pre><code>    import pygame
    from pygame.transform import *
</code></pre>

<p>Your for-loop is just repeatedly reassigning the name <code>image</code> to <code>scale(image, (15, 15))</code>.  It never affects the objects stored in <code>numbers</code>.  Below is a demonstration</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [[1], [2]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in lst:
...     i = [3]
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst
[[1], [2]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; i
[3]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To fix the problem, you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow">list comprehension</a> and mutate <code>numbers</code> in-place:</p>
<pre><code>numbers[:] = [scale(image, (15, 15)) for image in numbers]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Assigning to <code>numbers</code> would be enough, no need to mutate the original list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sure, you could do that if you want.  It looked like the OP wanted to preserve the original list object though, so I gave a solution that mutates <code>numbers</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I actually don't need to preserve the original list, I just created the list to give the for-loop something to iterate through.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just want to to change the value of each of the numX_imgs so that I can call them individually later on and draw them at their correct size without needing to go through the list itself.  To clarify a little bit. Later on in the program I am going to create a function that draws the score using the images to represent the numbers. So          if score == 0:             "draw num0_img" in the correct size</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user3738713 - Oh, I see.  But may I ask what is wrong with having a list of images?  IMO, using numbered variables such as <code>num0_img</code>, <code>num1_img</code>, etc. is bad design...especially when you can simply use a list and have them numbered by index.  For example, <code>images[0]</code> would be the same as <code>num0_img</code>, <code>images[1]</code> would be <code>num1_img</code>, etc.</span>
