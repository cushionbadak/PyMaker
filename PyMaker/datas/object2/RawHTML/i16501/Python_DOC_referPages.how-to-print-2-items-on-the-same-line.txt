<p>I would prefer that the 2 lines that print new balance were on the same line instead of 2 separate lines. How do i do this?</p>
<pre><code>def main():

    # Initial balance
    balance = input ('Wallet balance: ')

    # Withdraw amount from wallet balance
    withdraw = input ('Withdraw amount: ')

    # Withdraw process and new balance display
    if withdraw &gt; 0:
        new = balance - withdraw
        print ('Your new balance: ')
        print new

main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Separate the values with a comma:</p>
<pre><code>print 'Your new balance:', new
</code></pre>
<p>See a demonstration below:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; new = 123
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'Your new balance:', new
Your new balance: 123
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'
a b c d
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that doing so automatically places a space between the values.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The task that you want to complete is simple and is done as stated above by using the ','       x = "123"     y = "456"     print x,y  The problem is usually when you use a loop and inside it you want to use a print. Then in order to get the output in one line you can do:      import sys     for i in "123456":        sys.stdout.write(i)  and you get it in one line.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">WOW this site is so quick with help, thanks! and a quick question, are the parenthesis even necessary that i have in my code?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TollyBear - Not in Python 2.x, where <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-print_stmt" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print</code> is a statement</a>.  You need them in Python 3.x though because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print</code> is a function</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how can i make this indefinitely repeat as needed by the user?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@iCodez no sorry i wasn't clear, i mean so they can repeat the process starting at ' # Withdraw amount from wallet balance 	withdraw = input ('Withdraw amount: ')  	# Withdraw process and new balance display 	if withdraw &gt; 0: 		new = balance - withdraw 		print ('Your new balance: '), new '</span>
