<p>I have seen people make IM servers through python so i could use that. But any other ideas would be great. I know I can send emails using python but maybe I could have python wait for one? I don't know. But any ideas will help. Anything that sounds like a valid solution i will try to learn about. Go easy on me, i am new at stack overflow.</p>
<p>also i will be writing this in python.</p>
