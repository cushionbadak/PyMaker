<p>I have a little Python program that uses keyboard input to run certain commands. </p>
<p>I setup everything in one main program loop but now I'm wondering, do I even need a main loop?  </p>
<p>Here is what I mean:</p>
<pre><code>mainProgramLoop = 1   
while mainProgramLoop == 1:

    print ("\nType in the command. ")

    keyBoardInput= input("command:")

    if keyBoardInput == "a":
       #do this
    elif keyBoardInput == "b":
       #do this
</code></pre>
<p>Do I actually need that while loop?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>No, you do not need a main loop if you use the <code>cmd.Cmd</code> class included with Python:</p>
<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env python3
import cmd

class App(cmd.Cmd):

    prompt = 'Type in a command: '

    def do_a(self, arg):
        print('I am doing whatever action "a" is.')

    def do_b(self, arg):
        print('I am doing whatever action "b" is.')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    App().cmdloop()
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a> for the <code>cmd</code> module includes an example near the bottom to help get you started.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">well, you need it if you want more than one command w/o rerunning the code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're the only one who knows if you need it. Does it still work correctly if you remove it? If yes, then you don't need it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why do you need the variable mainProgramLoop I would write while 1</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>while True:</code> would be neater than <code>mainProgramLoop = 1; while mainProgramLoop == 1:</code>; then you just <code>break</code>.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I think this clears things up for me!</span>
