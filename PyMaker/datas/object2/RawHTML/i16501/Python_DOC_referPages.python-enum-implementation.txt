<p>I have declared the enum as follows in python.I don't know how to use them.When I create an instance of this class it gives error as two arguments are required one given.</p>
<pre><code>class CBarReference(Enum):    
ThisBar = 0,
NextBar = 1,
Undefined=2
a=CBarReference()
</code></pre>
<p>I know what error is but I don't know what to give as the second argument other than self.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You should never have to create an instance of an enum; they're all accessed directly from the class, and you can just assign them to variables as you like:</p>
<pre><code>a = CBarReference.ThisBar
b = CBarReference.NextBar
c = CBarReference.Undefined
d = CBarReference.ThisBar
assert(a == d)
assert(b != a)
assert(b != c)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Have you read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>? Or considered showing the actual code you're running and full error traceback?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just tell how to make this type of class and the second argument.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need to create an instance.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you need an instance for? The reason you're getting the error is because the constructor to Enum expects *args strings so that you can create an enum without subclassing.</span>
