<p>I have tried to search for the answer but I can't find it.</p>
<p>I have two lists. Both lists have <strong>71 items</strong>. </p>
<p>I want every index in both lists to be combined. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oGxwX.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">These two list that I want to combine</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3muop.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This is what I get but it is not what I want</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2HyOB.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This is the result that I want</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>extensions =['.sp1', '.sp1', '.sp2']
my_numbers =[4, 16, 128]
new_list = []

for x in range(len(my_numbers)):
    new_list.append("".join([str(my_numbers[x]), extensions[x]]))

print(new_list)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>['4.sp1', '16.sp1', '128.sp2']
</code></pre>
