<p>I recently ran <code>pip install pyodbc</code>. Which says it installed pyodbc successfully on the cmd. </p>
<p>However when I do <code>import pyodbc</code> in IDLE I receive an error saying 'No module named pyodbc'. </p>
<p>It seems only two files have been installed when I ran <code>pip install pyodbc</code>.</p>
<p>The two files:</p>
<p>pyodbc-4.0.26.dist-info</p>
<p>pyodbc.cp36-win32.pyd</p>
<p>VERSION of Python:
Python 3.6.3</p>
<p>Complete Error Message:

<p>How do I resolve this issue? Any help would be much appreciated, I'm new to python and this is quite frustrating.</p>

<p>The files that installed are fine. *.pyd is compiled library (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#is-a-pyd-file-the-same-as-a-dll" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#is-a-pyd-file-the-same-as-a-dll</a>).</p>
<p>Issues that may cause this:</p>
<ol>
<li>IDLE running main python installation and you installed the package in virtual environment</li>
<li>You have several installations of python e.g. python 3.x alongside python 2.x</li>
</ol>
<p>I think first of all try to run all the steps from the same cmd:</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; pip install pyodbc

# now just run python interpreter

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import pyodbc
# no error
</code></pre>
<p>This should work...</p>
<p>And then try to understand if you have several virtualenvs or python instalations.
You can check which python IDLE run, by right click on it's shortcut and "open file location" for example</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Show the complete error message.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you try upgrading? <code>pip install --upgrade pyodbc</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just tried upgrading and it says 'Requirement already up-to-date'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What happens when you do <code>setup.py install</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you Leon! Yup got no error when I tried it that way. I have both serveral virtual machines and python installations lol. I will do some troubleshooting on that now but thanks again for helping me understand the problem!</span>
