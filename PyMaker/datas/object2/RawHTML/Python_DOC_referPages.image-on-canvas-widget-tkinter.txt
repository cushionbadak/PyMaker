<p>I already am almost finished with a game I am making, but now I want to have the characters that are moving around, look a bit better graphically than just blocks. However, all code has been made so, that it only works with canvas widgets (in this case rectangles) and not with images. 
So, is there a way to paste images onto such canvas widgets or fill canvas widgets with an image. After some research, I thought I could do this with PIL, but it didn't work for me.</p>
<p>Any tips or other recommended packages to use in this case? Or should I just rewrite all of my code to work with the image object (a.k.a. the things I asked about above are impossible).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Could you show your code? It's very hard to answer your question without seeing it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you read through the documentation of the canvas widget? The methods for drawing images are documented there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Bryan Oakley I know how to make an image on a canvas. But I want to have this image in a rectangle or any such shape.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried simply drawing a rectangle around the image?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What I want to do is to have an image in or on top of a shape in a canvas widget. So that I don't have to change any of my code. (The image will thus act as a fill for a rectangle for example)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think thats possible. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37373820/python-tkinter-canvas-rectangle-with-an-image" title="python tkinter canvas rectangle with an image">stackoverflow.com/questions/37373820/â€¦</a></span>
