<p>I have a behavioral question about Python. Coming from the C background, I understand that modules are not the same as header files. </p>
<p>Here are two scripts:</p>
<p>Module1.py</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python3
import urllib
</code></pre>
<p>Driver.py</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python3
import module1
</code></pre>
<p>The behavior I expected at first was for urllib to be imported along with module1 inside the driver. However, this is not the behavior that I am experiencing. Is it correct to put</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python3
import urllib
import module1
</code></pre>
<p>Or does that cause urllib to be imported twice?</p>
<p>I read in the documentation that the I can do something like</p>
<pre><code>from module1 import urllib
</code></pre>
<p>but that seems to be too much writing</p>

<p>Why should it? You've imported <code>urllib</code> inside the namespace (module dictionary) of <code>module1</code> and not in that of <code>Driver</code>.</p>
<p><code>urllib</code> is imported but, in <code>module1</code>, try:</p>
<pre><code>import Driver
Driver.module1.urllib
</code></pre>
<p>and see that no <code>NameError</code>s are raised, <code>urllib</code> is there.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No, Python will see <code>urllib</code> has already been imported (by peeking inside <code>sys.modules</code>) and just create an entry for <code>urllib</code> in the namespace or <code>Driver</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Okay, this makes sense. In C, if I imported some library into a header file and imported the header file into a driver, the entire header file would be imported, including imported libraries. Thank you for clarifying the difference.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't try and draw parallels between <code>C</code> and <code>Python</code> @Shadowfax . :-) Even though the most popular implementation of Python is implemented in <code>C</code> it is a completely different language with different semantics! Take a peek at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reference manual</a>, it clears up pretty much most questions you might encounter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, thank you! @Jim</span>
