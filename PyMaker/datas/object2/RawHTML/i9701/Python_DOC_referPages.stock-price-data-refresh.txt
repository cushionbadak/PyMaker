<p>I am very new and I am getting totally stuck with recent task. I want to autorefresh stock price automatically as it is changing. I am scrapping nasdaq.com
website for actual intraday price.
I have a recent code: </p>
<pre><code>import bs4 as bs
import urllib
tiker = input("zadaj ticker: ")
url = urllib.request.urlopen("http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/"+tiker+"/real-time")
stranka = url.read()
soup = bs.BeautifulSoup(stranka, 'lxml')
print (tiker.upper())
for each in soup.find('div', attrs={'id': 'qwidget_lastsale'}):
    print(each.string)
</code></pre>
<p>I was only able to make an infinite loop while True but i get prints in lines despite i want to change only one line as actual price is changing.
very thank you for your notes.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can achieve it by printing "\b" to remove the previously printed string and then printing on the same line:</p>
<pre><code>import bs4 as bs
import urllib
import time
import sys

tiker = input("zadaj ticker: ")
print (tiker.upper())
written_string = ''
while True:
    url = urllib.request.urlopen("http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/"+tiker+"/real-time")
    stranka = url.read()
    soup = bs.BeautifulSoup(stranka, 'lxml')
    for each in soup.find('div', attrs={'id': 'qwidget_lastsale'}):
        for i in range(len(written_string)):
            sys.stderr.write("\b")
        sys.stderr.write(each.string)
        written_string = each.string
    time.sleep(1)
</code></pre>
</div>

<span class="comment-copy">thank you sir. can you give me a hint how to overwrite the previous print as the price is changing... Your code just prints prices in line but want to just one print which is changing as a price change</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've changed the example, this should work now.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">now it is perfect. very thank you, sir</span>
