<p><strong>Using third party library named "nsetools" for fetching stock data</strong></p>

<p><strong>I want to make the code starting from here short</strong></p>
<pre><code>### Adaniports

stock1Close = stock1['closePrice']

### Hindalco
stock2      = nse.get_quote('hindalco')
stock2Close = stock2['closePrice']

### ONGC
stock3      = nse.get_quote('ongc')
stock3Close = stock3['closePrice']

### SBIN
stock4      = nse.get_quote('sbin')
stock4Close = stock4['closePrice']

current_value = (stock1Close * qty['ADANIPORTS']) + (stock2Close * qty['HINDALCO']) + (stock3Close * qty['ONGC']) + (stock4Close * qty['SBIN'])

<p>Is there any way to loop through the dictionary, access the closing prices of each individual stock and then calculate the current value of the investment preferably in one or two lines?</p>

<p>I asked this on <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/">codereview.stackexchange.com</a> and received the answer</p>
<pre><code>def get_closing(stock):
    return nse.get_quote(stock)['closePrice']

stock_gen = (get_closing(stock) * qty for stock, qty in stock_qty.items())
current_value = sum(stock_gen)

<p>To do this as a one liner you can sum over a list comprehension, <code>[expression for var in collection]</code>. Reference section 5.1.3 in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow" title="docs">docs</a></p>
<pre><code>current_value = sum([nse.get_quote(n.lower())['closePrice'] * qty[n] for n in qty.keys()])

<span class="comment-copy">check <a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com">codereview.stackexchange.com</a>, they'll help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because belongs to code review</span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this may be a valid answer, you are much more likely to help others by explaining what the code does and how it works. Code-only answers tend to receive less positive attention and aren't as useful as other answers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aurora0001 Thank you for the recommendation.  I added some additional explanation.</span>
