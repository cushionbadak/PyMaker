<p>I have extracted the data I need from two columns of an excel sheet as two lists. When I try to combine these two lists into a dictionary, the final output has only 300 entries whereas my excel sheet has about 1200 entries. Why aren't all the entries being stored in the dictionary?</p>
<p>Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>import xlrd

xl_workbook = xlrd.open_workbook("my_doc.xls")
sheet1 = xl_workbook.sheet_by_index(0)

list1 = sheet1.col_values(2)
list2 = sheet1.col_values(3)

data = dict(zip(list1, list2))
</code></pre>
<p>I tried printing lengths of list1, list2, and data to cross-check.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dictionaries</a> can only contain unique keys. Check the length of <code>set(list1)</code> to see how many unique keys you have.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you sure there are no repeated entries in <code>list1</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just realized there were multiple repeated entries.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So if I need all entries to be present in my output, what would the best way to go? I need each entry in list1 to correspond to each entry in list2</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What should <code>data[repeated_entry]</code> return in your opinion?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need my final output to be an excel sheet with two columns - list1 and list2 - with all 1200 entries.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why even bother making a dictionary then? Why not just have a list of tuples?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want to use it at a later stage to loop through :-/ But I guess I'll make a list of tuples for now.</span>
