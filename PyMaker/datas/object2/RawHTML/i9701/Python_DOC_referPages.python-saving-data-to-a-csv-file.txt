<p>I normally use txt files but i need to use a csv i based this off how i do txt files and i am not sure what i am doing wrong can anyone help me please.</p>
<pre><code>Home = "Road"
House = 5

def Save(Home,House):
    Saved=open('Saved.csv', 'a')
    Saved.write(Home+House+"/n")
    Saved.close()

Save(Home,House)
</code></pre>
<p>I get this error </p>
<pre><code>File "F:/Pygame/Test12.py", line 74, in Save
     Saved.write(Home+House+"/n")
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
</code></pre>

<p>1) that's not a <code>.csv</code> file.</p>
<p>2) in python, you cannot concatenate integers with strings without prior conversion.</p>
<p>3) doing this: <code>Home+str(House)</code> would be legal, but when you want to read back your file you have to separate both fields (you provided no way of separating them)</p>
<p>Here's a code which would create a <em>real</em> csv file:</p>
<pre><code>import csv
def Save(Home,House):
    with open('Saved.csv', 'a') as Saved:
       cw = csv.writer(Saved)
       cw.writerow([Home,House])
</code></pre>
<p>when you compose your row, you can put any data you want, the <code>csv</code> module will convert it to string if needed.</p>
<p>BTW to read it back, use a <code>csv.reader</code> and iterate through the rows. Since you know the datatype, you can convert 2nd column to <code>int</code> directly.</p>
<pre><code>with open('Saved.csv', 'r') as Saved:
   cr = csv.reader(Saved)
   for row in cr:
       Home = row[0]
       House = int(row[1])
       # now you have to do something with those variables :)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can not concatenate an integer with a string, use the following to convert the int to string:</p>
<pre><code>Saved.write(Home + str(House) + "\n")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python variables have types.  So you are trying to add 5 to the 'House' which is not defined application.  To make this work you have to convert number 5 to string '5'.  As ettanany suggest use</p>
<pre><code>Saved.write(Home+str(House)+"\n")
</code></pre>
<p>Also,  note that it's  '\n' not '/n'</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">â€¦what are you trying to do? What should <code>Home+House+"/n"</code> give? (Also, you're using a forward slash. I'm guessing that should be a backslash.) Where does CSV come in here? I don't see any evidence of it. If you're trying to read or write CSV files you should be using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#module-csv" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code> module</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so if i wanted to read the home and the house from the csv file how would i do it properly</span>
<span class="comment-copy">edited to show the read part. have fun!</span>
