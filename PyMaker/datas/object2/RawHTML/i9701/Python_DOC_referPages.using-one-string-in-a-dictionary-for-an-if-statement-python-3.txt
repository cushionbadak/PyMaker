<p>High schooler here, studying dictionaries. Just wanna know how do I get an input from one variable to match one of the strings in my dictionary to comply with my if-statement.</p>
<p>Sorry, by the way, if this question has been asked already. I'm not too familiar with the terms, so I may have not been able to search the right questions.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First of all it's not a dictionary but <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set</a>. It's also based on hash-tree. You should check it in the following way:</p>
<pre><code>if name in diction1:
    # do stuff
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">That's a set, not a dictionary. You're currently comparing the input with the whole set rather than checking for membership within the set.</span>
