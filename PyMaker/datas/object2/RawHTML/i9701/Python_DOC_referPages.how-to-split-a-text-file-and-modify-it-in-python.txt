<p>I currently have a text file that reads like this:</p>
<pre><code>101, Liberia, Monrovia, 111000, 3200000, Africa, English, Liberia Dollar;
102, Uganda, Kampala, 236000, 34000000, Africa, English and Swahili, Ugandan Shilling;
103, Madagascar, Antananarivo, 587000, 21000000, Africa, Magalasy and Frances, Malagasy Ariary;
</code></pre>
<p>I'm currently printing the file using this code:</p>
<pre><code>with open ("base.txt",'r') as f:
   for line in f:
      words = line.split(';')
      for word in words:
         print (word)
</code></pre>
<p>What I would like to know is, how can I modify a line by using their id number (101 for example) and keep the format they have and add or remove lines based on their id number?</p>

<p>My understanding your asking how to modify a word in a line and then insert the modified line back into the file.</p>
<h2>Change a word in the file</h2>
<pre><code>def change_value(new_value, line_number, column):
    with open("base.txt",'r+') as f: #r+ means we can read and write to the file
        lines = f.read().split('\n') #lines is now a list of all the lines in the file
        words = lines[line_number].split(',')
        words[column] = new_value
        lines[line_number] = ','.join(words).rstrip('\n') #inserts the line into lines where each word is seperated by a ','
        f.seek(0)
        f.write('\n'.join(lines)) #writes our new lines back into the file
</code></pre>
<p>In order to use this function to set <code>line 3, word 2</code> to <code>Not_Madasgascar</code> call it like this:</p>
<pre><code>change_word("Not_Madagascar", 2, 1)
</code></pre>
<p>You will always have to add <code>1</code> to the line/word number because the first line/word is <code>0</code></p>
<h2>Add a new line to the file</h2>
<pre><code>def add_line(words, line_number):
    with open("base.txt",'r+') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
        lines.insert(line_number, ','.join(words) + '\n')
        f.seek(0)
        f.writelines(lines)
</code></pre>
<p>In order to use this function add a line at the end containing the words <code>this</code> <code>line</code> <code>is</code> <code>at</code> <code>the</code> <code>end</code> call it like this:</p>
<pre><code>add_line(['this','line','is','at','the','end'], 4) #4 is the line number
</code></pre>

<p>Reading this file into an <code>OrderedDict</code> would probably be helpful if you are trying to preserve the original file ordering as well as have the ability to references lines in the file for modification/addition/deletion.  There are quite a few assumptions about the full format of the file in the following example, but it will work for your test case:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import OrderedDict

content = OrderedDict()

with open('base.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        if line.strip():
            print line
            words = line.split(',')  # Assuming that you meant ',' vs ';' to split the line into words
            content[int(words[0])] = ','.join(words[1:])

print(content[101])  # Prints " Liberia, Monrovia, etc"...

content.pop(101, None)  # Remove line w/ 101 as the "id"
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It's unclear what you mean by an line. Do you mean a line of the file, or a list element after you used split()?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A list element after the split() and then changing or adding text to those lists</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you mean <code>line.split(',')</code>? From the file you gave spliting the lines by <code>;</code> wouldn't do much.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A csv editor sounds like a good fit, but you may want to provide some more explanation of what your commands do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry but I'm fairly new to all of this, how would I go using the function [change_word]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Nandito104 No worries! Everyone's a beginner at some point. I will change my post will more details on using it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Nandito104 It's changed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">huge thanks, man</span>
<span class="comment-copy">in case i wanted to add another line, how would i go about that, based on the function you gave me?</span>
