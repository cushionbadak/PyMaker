<p>I'm writing a countdown clock in python, but it looks like the time module only goes down to the second. Is there a way for me to accurately determine when exactly 1 second has passed?</p>
<p>Seems like my question was a little confusing, let me clarify. I need to run some code, then, at the end, the program enters a while loop and exits once at least 1000 milliseconds have passed since the time the code started running</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you <em>know</em> the code you want to run will take less than 1 second, then <code>1 - elapsed time</code> will give you the remaining time to sleep, no <code>while</code> loop required.</p>
<pre><code>now = time.time()
foo()
time.sleep(1 - (time.time() - now))
</code></pre>
<p>There will be some overhead with the arithmetic, but it's within 1/100 of a second and will be strictly greater than 1 second, as you request. I ran the following code:</p>
<pre><code>import time
import random

def foo():
    time.sleep(random.random())

now = time.time()
foo()
time.sleep(1 - (time.time() - now))

print "Time elapsed: {}".format(time.time() - now)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Time elapsed: 1.00379300117
</code></pre>
<p>You can run this several times to verify it gives the output you want, no matter how long <code>foo</code> takes.</p>
<p>Unless it takes longer than 1 second, then the sleep time will be negative which will result in <code>IOError</code>. You would need to check for that case.</p>
<p>Or, if you need to kill the function if 1 second has passed, check <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/492519/timeout-on-a-function-call">this question</a></p>

<p>Here is a way which will work, though im not sure which modules you are limited to.</p>
<pre><code>import time

def procedure:
    time.sleep(2.5)

# measure wall time
t0 = time.time()
procedure()
print time.time() - t0, "seconds wall time"
</code></pre>
<p><em>2.50023603439 seconds wall time</em></p>
<p>where procedure is a reference to the function you are timing.</p>

<p>By default the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>time</code></a> module gives you the time to the 10^-5 second    </p>
<pre><code>import time
time.time()
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1480643510.89443
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">did you try the datetime module? specifically check out the timedelta object</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#timer-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Timer</a> objects.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Timer won't really work for what I'm doing, because I need to run some code then wait until the remainder of the second has passed. I don't want to wait a second and then run the code, because then it will be off</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then use <code>time.sleep</code> in conjunction with <code>time.time</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Remember, precision and accuracy are two different things. Fallenreaper's answer will give you subsecond precision, but I suspect you'll be disappointed in the accuracy.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! exactly what I needed!</span>
