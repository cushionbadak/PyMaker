<p>So I have a csv file of arbitrary amount of columns and rows (fully rectangular so no missing cells) of which I want to turn into a dictionary.</p>
<pre><code>key1   key2   key3
1      2      3
4      5      6
7      8      9
</code></pre>
<p>I want to have a dictionary that will follow this pattern</p>
<pre><code>{key1:[1,4,7], key2:[2,5,8], key3:[3,6,9]}
</code></pre>
<p>What I'm doing right now is reading each line. If I'm reading the first line each element becomes a key in the dictionary and maps to an empty list. Then I continue reading each line but here's where I run into the problem. I don't know how I assign the elements of each line to it's correct key (as dictionaries are random), that's assuming I know how to make generate a list of values that I can properly assign in the first place (for example, how can i make 1 go to key1, 2 go to key2 and 3 go to key3). </p>
<p>I want to do this all without imports. Let me know what you guys think. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = '''key1   key2   key3
1      2      3
4      5      6
7      8      9
'''.splitlines()

&gt;&gt;&gt; fields = s[0].split()
&gt;&gt;&gt; rows = [[int(x) for x in line.split()] for line in s[1:]]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(dict(zip(fields, zip(*rows))))
{'key1': (1, 4, 7), 'key2': (2, 5, 8), 'key3': (3, 6, 9)}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>s[0]</code> is the first row of headings.</li>
<li>The <code>.split()</code> breaks the words into the field names</li>
<li><code>s[1:]</code> gets the lines after the header row</li>
<li><code>line.split()</code> splits the row into field values</li>
<li><code>int(x)</code> converts the string entry <em>"1"</em> into the number <em>1</em></li>
<li><code>zip(*rows)</code> transposes the list of rows</li>
<li><code>zip(fields, transposed_rows)</code> makes a list of key/value pairs</li>
<li><code>dict(list_of_pairs)</code> makes the dictionary</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">It's a small part of an assignment, I've been pondering about it for over an hour now :/ It's the randomness of the dictionary that's messing me up. I did say what I was doing and where I am stuck, even a pointer would be great to get me back on track :/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why don't you post the (presumably non-working) code that you wrote in over an hour then? We can then try to correct your error(s). You won't get any answers this way because Stack Overflow is <i>not</i> a code writing service.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">-sets off plagiarism checker- I did outline my thinking though and pretty much what the code was doing though. I'm stuck on assigning the list of elements for example [1,4,7] to key1 because of the randomness of dictionaries. I can't just say dictionary[0] = [1,4,7]. I'm not even asking for an answer, just something that will even hint towards how I should go about this will be good enough for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">-facepalm- thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I found a different way of doing but it out of curiosity what does zip do in general?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the solid response,</span>
