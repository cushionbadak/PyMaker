<p>I am currently using psutil to do...</p>

<p>As Ignacio said, my question didn't make sense: "Functions do not have a process ID independent of the VM"</p>
<p>Though to answer the essence of my question: "how can i stop the execution of a function (infinite while loop) from outside of that function?" </p>
<p>We check a flag, e.g. a value set in a database. Helped by a kind stranger in #python in freenode</p>

<span class="comment-copy">There is no such thing as "the process of one function". All functions run in the same process.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">It's certainly not to make any arbitrary Python program use multiple processes...</span>
