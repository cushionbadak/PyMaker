<p>I had to make a file : planets.txt with information about planets. The file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Planet1 100 200

planet2 200 300

planet3 400 250
</code></pre>
<p>I have to write a function in python that returns a list with tuples of this information like this :</p>
<pre><code>[(100,200),(200,300),(400,250)]
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is that I don't know how to write this function. Is there anyone who can help me?
Thank you very very much !</p>

<p>Something like this perhaps?</p>
<pre><code>ret = []
lines = open('file.txt').readlines()
for line in lines:
    name, first, second = line.split(' ')
    ret.append((int(first), int(second)))
</code></pre>

<p>If you are looking for compact code.</p>
<pre><code>f = open('your_file_path').readlines()
print [tuple(map(int,a.split()[1:])) for a in f if a != '\n']
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>[(100, 200), (200, 300), (400, 250)]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to split each line of your file and append the tuple of the second and the third items of each resulted list to <code>res</code> list like below:</p>
<pre><code>res = []

with open('planets.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        if line.split():  # I add this because from your input, seems that your file contains some blank lines!
            res.append(tuple(line.split()[1:]))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; res
[('100', '200'), ('200', '300'), ('400', '250')]
</code></pre>
<p>You can convert each tuple's items to integers like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [tuple(map(int, item)) for item in res]
[(100, 200), (200, 300), (400, 250)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Start reading through <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Tutorial</a> and practicing the examples - it will give you ideas.

<span class="comment-copy">Why don't use the <code>with</code> keyword ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good question. Was making it compact. <code>with</code> is a better option. I was wondering what will happen to file object since reference count is zero. Check this answer: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1834556/does-a-file-object-automatically-close-when-its-reference-count-hits-zero" title="does a file object automatically close when its reference count hits zero">stackoverflow.com/questions/1834556/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's no need to call <code>.readlines()</code>. Just loop <code>for line in f:</code> and avoid holding all the lines in memory for no reason when you only need one at a time while parsing (Note: I up-voted anyway, because you were the only answer that actually used <code>with</code> appropriately)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShadowRanger Thanks. I know that <code>readlines()</code> is not required. I just like explicit things, but I will remove it anyway!</span>
