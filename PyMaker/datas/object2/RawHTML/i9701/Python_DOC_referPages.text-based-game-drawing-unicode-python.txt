<p>I'm a starting programmer looking to make a simple text based RPG from scratch. I know there might be an easy tool to do this but I want as little handed to me as possible to use this project as a sort of learning possible. I've been using Python and so far I really like it (I'm willing to use Java or Javascript if absolutely necessary.)</p>
<p>My problem though is that right now I'm using the console to run the game but I'd prefer to run it as a standalone application (also so I can distribute it in like an .exe or similar). Is there some simple way I can do this? Everything is in Unicode, so it just needs to be able to display Unicode text (in-line preferably) and have some way to check for key presses (to type commands).</p>
<p>I've looked into Kivy, but it seems far beyond what I need and the text it displays is not in-line and must be displayed line by line. Plus it doesn't seem to be able to be exported to a single file.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help and remember I'm very much a newbie.</p>

<p>If you want a GUI in Python, you can use TkInter, which is fairly easy to learn (<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter</a>).</p>
<p>However, if you want to make it an executable so you can share it then you have to use something like the following: </p>
<p>cx_freeze (<a href="http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/</a>) </p>
<p>py2exe(<a href="http://www.py2exe.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.py2exe.org</a>) </p>
<p>PyInstaller(<a href="http://www.pyinstaller.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.pyinstaller.org</a>)</p>
<p>These will 'freeze' your Python scripts by including the interpreter and libraries in the .exe file. There's a lot of information in this previously asked question; <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10592913/how-do-i-convert-a-python-program-to-a-runnable-exe-windows-program">How do i convert a Python program to a runnable .exe Windows program?</a></p>

<p>Here's a basic example of a text thing in <code>tkinter</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter import *

root = Tk()
playerEntry = Entry(root)
textLabel = Label(root, justify=LEFT)
playerEntry.pack()
textLabel.pack()

def changeText(addText):
    textLabel.config(text = textLabel["text"] + addText + "\n")   

def get(event):
    changeText("&gt;&gt;&gt; %s" % playerEntry.get())
    do_stuff()
    playerEntry.delete(0, END)

def do_stuff():
    changeText("Stuff is happening")

playerEntry.bind("&lt;Return&gt;", get)

root.mainloop()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">By "standalone application" do you mean not in the console? A graphics interface? A web-based application?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@rassar Like a graphics interface, that can be run from a file like an .exe. Sorry should have been more clear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">have you looked into <code>tkinter</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html</a> ? also what version of python are you using?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'll look into that, seems like it might be what I'm looking for. I'm currently using 2.7.0</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This seems like what I need. I'm investigating TkInter, and it seems like what I want. I have looked into some of those before and once i get to that point I'm sure I'll look closer. Thanks.</span>
