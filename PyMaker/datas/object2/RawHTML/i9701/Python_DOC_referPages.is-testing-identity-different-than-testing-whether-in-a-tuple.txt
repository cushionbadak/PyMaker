<p>I need to check if a function written by another team returns <code>True</code> or <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>I want to check for identity, not equality. </p>
<p>I'm unclear what type of check happens when using <code>in</code>. Which of the following does <code>if result in (True, None):</code> behave like?</p>
<ol>
<li><p><code>if result is True or result is None:</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>if result or result == None:</code></p></li>

<p>No, they are not the same, because identity testing is a subset of what the <code>in</code> operator does.</p>
<pre><code>if result in (True, None):
</code></pre>
<p>Is the same as this:</p>
<pre><code>if result == True or result is True or result == None or result is None:
# notice that this is both #1 and #2 OR'd together
</code></pre>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#membership-test-operations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>For container types such as list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, or collections.deque, the expression x in y is equivalent to any(x is e or x == e for e in y)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The in operator tests for both equality and identity, and either one being true will return <code>True</code>. I got the impression that you're only working with boolean values and <code>None</code>. In that limited case, the <code>in</code> operator will behave the same as both of your other snippets.</p>
<p>However, you said you want identity checking. So I would suggest you use that explicitly so your code's intention and what it is expecting is clear. Furthermore, if there is a bug in the called function and it returns something other than boolean or <code>None</code>, using the <code>in</code> operator can hide that bug.</p>
<p>I would suggest your first alternative:</p>
<pre><code>if result is True or result is None:
    # do stuff
else:
    # do other stuff
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you're feeling defensive:</p>
<pre><code>if result is True or result is None:
    # do stuff
elif result is False:
    # do other stuff
else:
    # raise exception or halt and catch fire
</code></pre>

<p>You want to use the <strong>identity operator</strong> (is) and not the membership operator (in):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; 1 == True
True
&gt; 1 is True
False
&gt; 1 in (True, None)
True
</code></pre>
<p>This is a "TL;DR" complement to @skrrgwasme answer :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can the function return anything besides boolean or None?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"<code>if result in (True, None)</code> will behave the same as both of your other code examples." - no it won't. It won't behave like the first snippet because other things can be equal to <code>True</code> and <code>None</code>. For example, <code>1.0 == True</code>. It won't behave like the second snippet because that snippet treats <code>result</code> as a boolean directly instead of comparing it to <code>True</code> with <code>==</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think it's more intuitive to check the identity explicitly rather using the membership operator...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112 I got the impression that the only possible return values are <code>True</code>, <code>False</code>, and <code>None</code>. If that's the case, then they will behave the same.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, this is helpful. Can you reorder your answer slightly to make it clear they aren't the same and the <code>in</code> operator behaves like the 2, not 1? I'll happily accept it then.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JeffWidman I've reworded it to hopefully make it more clear, but I have to correct your last comment: it's not more like #1 <i>or</i> #2. It's <b>both</b>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry if you meant I copied your original work but we posted around the same time and by the time I posted, your answer wasn't full of editions ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I wrote this on my console. Is there anyway to see the history of deleted comments? I honestly don't recall anyone posting this code snippet neither more than two answers on the thread.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fair enough - sorry for the accusation. I'll remove the downvote if you make a small edit. (I can't change my vote until it's edited.)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that's fine mate, actually think this is a complement to your answer. there are more in-depth arguments in your answer. mine is more a "TL;DR"</span>
