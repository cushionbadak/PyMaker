<p>Is there a python3 version of the win32com module? </p>
<p>I am running python 3.4.4 and I tried installing the win32com module, but it is written in python2 syntax.<br/>
So I thought I would sort the syntax out myself, but it proved to be a task I couldn't quite handle.</p>
<pre><code>line 2403, in convert_optional_data_files
    RuntimeError, details
NameError: name 'details' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>Long story short: is there a python3 win32com?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why not try <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/2to3.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>py2to3</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">will that be able to do the whole module folder?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No idea, never tried it. Just seems like a better option than manually doing it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">well i thought it would just be the setup file that i would have to change, so i thought i could do it, but it turns out it wasnt</span>
