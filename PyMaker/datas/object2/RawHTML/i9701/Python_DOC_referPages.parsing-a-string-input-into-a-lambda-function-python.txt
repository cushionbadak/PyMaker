<p>How can I parse a string input into the proper form for it to be executed as mapping regulation in a lambda function?</p>
<pre><code> fx=type(input("Enter a polynomial: "))
</code></pre>
<p>This is my input, I want to enter arbirtray polynomials.</p>
<pre><code>f= lambda x: fx
</code></pre>
<p>Now i want my lambda function to be able to execute the strings from the input function just as if they were normal mapping regulations like <code>x**2</code> for instance.</p>

<p>First things first, <code>input()</code> behaves differently in Python 2 and Python 3, as  specified in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4915361/whats-the-difference-between-raw-input-and-input-in-python3-x">this</a> answer.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>eval()</code></a> is one of the simplest options:</p>
<h1>Python 3</h1>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fx = input("Enter a polynomial: ")
Enter a polynomial: x**2 + 2*x + 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = lambda x: eval(fx)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f(1)
4
</code></pre>
<h1>Python 2</h1>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; fx = raw_input("Enter a polynomial: ")
Enter a polynomial: x**2 + 2*x + 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = lambda x: eval(fx)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f(1)
4
</code></pre>
<p>Be careful though, as <code>eval()</code> can execute arbitrary code.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Your question is not clear. Do you mean you want to input a string that represents a polynomial and store it in variable <code>fx</code>, then parse it into a new string format that can be evaluated more easily? Or do you want a function that evaluates that string and can be used in another, lambda function? Or something else? I hope you realize that your lambda expression as written is meaningless.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>fx</code> will always be <code>str</code>, unless you're using Python 2.x.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, i would like to do the second option. The expression is part of a bigger program, this is only the part that causes me my problem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, it now works  properly</span>
