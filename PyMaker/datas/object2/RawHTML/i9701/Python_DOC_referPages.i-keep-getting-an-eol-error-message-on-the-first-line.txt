<p>I'm making a diner menu and I don't know what I'm doing wrong on the first line. I think it's an "unexpected indent", but I don't know how to correct it. Any help would be awesome. </p>
<pre><code>print("Breakfast_Menu 
    (1) "Pancakes and eggs"
    (2) "Waffles with your pick between apple or oranges"
    (3) "Cheerios with month-old milk"
    (4) "Sausage-Egg Sandwich with yogurt"
    (5) "Sausage Biscuit with bacon"
    (6) "Oatmeal and applesauce"
    (7) "Coffee with air")

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your syntax is incorrect:</p>
<pre><code>print("Breakfast menu
</code></pre>
<p>opens a string,</p>
<pre><code>    (1) "
</code></pre>
<p>is still part of it, the last <code>"</code> closing it.</p>
<pre><code>Pancakes and eggs
</code></pre>
<p>is then parsed as Python code (ie. a variable named <code>Pancakes</code>, <code>and</code> keyword and another <code>egg</code> variable, etc.</p>
<p>The reason you get "EOF" message is that there's <strong>odd</strong> number of double quotes in total.  The last part of your code is actually <strong>opening</strong> a string:</p>
<pre><code>")
</code></pre>
<p>which is never closed.  In other words, <em>python</em> gets to the end of file before even parsing the code.</p>
<p>One way of getting what I think you want is:</p>
<pre><code>menu = [
    "Pancakes and eggs",
    "Waffles with your pick between apple or oranges",
    "Cheerios with month-old milk",
    "Sausage-Egg Sandwich with yogurt",
    "Sausage Biscuit with bacon",
    "Oatmeal and applesauce",
    "Coffee with air",
]
print("Breakfast menu")
for n, item in enumerate(menu):
    print("(%s) %s" % (n + 1, item))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
<p>String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using
  triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''. End of lines are automatically
  included in the string, but itâ€™s possible to prevent this by adding a
  \ at the end of the line. The following example:</p>
<pre><code>print("""\
Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]
     -h                        Display this usage message
     -H hostname               Hostname to connect to
""")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>print('''"Breakfast_Menu"
    (1) "Pancakes and eggs"
    (2) "Waffles with your pick between apple or oranges"
    (3) "Cheerios with month-old milk"
    (4) "Sausage-Egg Sandwich with yogurt"
    (5) "Sausage Biscuit with bacon"
    (6) "Oatmeal and applesauce"
    (7) "Coffee with air"''')
</code></pre>
<p>This will solve it</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The quotes are confusing the <code>print</code> statement. Try putting single quotes on either end of the print statement</span>
<span class="comment-copy">adding a brief explanation in addition to the code would make this answer better.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you could also escape the quotation marks :)</span>
