<p>I can join lines in Python using semi-colon, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>a=5; b=10
</code></pre>
<p>But why can't I do the same with for</p>
<pre><code>x=['a','b']; for i,j in enumerate(x): print(i,":", j)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The short (yet valid) answer is simply "because the language <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html">grammar</a> isn't defined to allow it". As for why <em>that's</em> the case, it's hard if not impossible to be sure unless you ask whoever came up with that portion of the grammar, but I imagine it's due to readability, which is one of the goals of Python<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Why would you ever want to write something obscure like that? Just split it up into multiple lines:</p>
<pre><code>x = ['a','b']
for i,j in enumerate(x):
    print(i, ":", j)
</code></pre>
<p>I would argue that this variant is much clearer.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because the Python grammar disallows it.  See <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/reference/compound_stmts.html">the documentation</a>:</p>
<pre><code>stmt_list     ::=  simple_stmt (";" simple_stmt)* [";"]
</code></pre>
<p>Semicolons can only be used to separate simple statements (not compound statements like <code>for</code>).  And, really, there's almost no reason to ever use them even for that.  Just use separate lines.  Python isn't designed to make it convenient to jam lots of code onto one line.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, and other developers, don't actually like the "semicolons and braces" style of code formatting.</p>
<p>For a brief look at how they feel about these things, try:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import braces
</code></pre>
<p>Statements in Python are supposed to be separated by blank lines, and compound statements in Python are supposed to be bounded by indentation.</p>
<p>The existence of <code>;</code> and one-line compound statements (e.g. <code>for i in x: print i</code>) are meant to be only <strong>very limited</strong> concessions... and you can't combine them.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The grammar of Python does not allow this. It's a good answer, but what's the reason for it?</p>
<p>I think the logic behind the decision is the following: body of a for loop must be indented in order to be recognized. So, if we allow not a <code>simple_stmt</code> there, it would require a complex and easy-to-break indentation. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A compound statement consists of one or more ‘clauses’. A clause consists of a header and a ‘suite.’ The clause headers of a particular compound statement are all at the same indentation level. Each clause header begins with a uniquely identifying keyword and ends with a colon. A suite is a group of statements controlled by a clause. A suite can be one or more semicolon-separated simple statements on the same line as the header, following the header’s colon, or it can be one or more indented statements on subsequent lines.</p>
<pre><code>x=['a','b'];
</code></pre>
<p>This does not justify the clause definition and thus cannot be used as a part of a compound statement. Therefore you encounter error.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">One use case would be to use in command line: <code>python -c 'import something; for ...'</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, I'm writing some notes for students and space was short so decided to join them as I was mentioning ; at the same time anyway :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, that made me laugh</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good point. I think that's probably the best rationale for this particular limitation (beyond just saying "GvR hates semicolons and braces")</span>
