<p>['0-0-0', '1-10-20', '3-10-15', '2-30-20', '1-0-5', '1-10-6', '3-10-30', '3-10-4']
How could I remove all the hyphens between the numbers?
Thanks (I'm a noob)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can just iterate through with a for loop and replace each instance of a hyphen with a blank.</p>
<pre><code>hyphenlist = ['0-0-0', '1-10-20', '3-10-15', '2-30-20', '1-0-5', '1-10-6', '3-10-30', '3-10-4']
newlist = []

for x in hyphenlist:
    newlist.append(x.replace('-', ''))
</code></pre>
<p>This code should give you a newlist without the hyphens.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Or as a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;l=['0-0-0', '1-10-20', '3-10-15', '2-30-20', '1-0-5', '1-10-6', '3-10-30', '3-10-4']
&gt;&gt;&gt;[i.replace('-','') for i in l] 
['000', '11020', '31015', '23020', '105', '1106', '31030', '3104']
</code></pre>
