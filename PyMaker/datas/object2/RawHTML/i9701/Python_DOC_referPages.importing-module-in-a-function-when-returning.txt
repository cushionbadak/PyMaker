<p>I've being searching on how to do this, but I could not find if there is a solution. I thought <code>__import__</code>? But I still couldn't manage to figure it out.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def combs(s = []):
...     from itertools import combinations
...     return [list(combinations(s, 2))]
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = ["A","B",'C']
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(combs(lst))
[[('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'C')]]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I'm curious if something like this could be done?</p>
<pre><code>def combs(s = []):
    return [list(combinations(s, 2))]__import__(itertools, list)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is how to achieve a dynamic import in your example:</p>
<pre><code>def combs(s = []):
    return list(__import__('itertools').combinations(s, 2))
</code></pre>
<p>NB: the python docs for <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#__import__" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>__import__</code></a> state that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an advanced function that is not needed in everyday Python programming</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many Pythonistas would prefer an explicit import (as in your original example), and would probably consider excessive use of <code>__import__</code> to be a bit of a code smell.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand your question. What is "this" that should be done? And why would you want to import something on return?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AndrasDeak Just curious if there is a way to do this, What I am refering to "this" is the code <code>__import__(itertools, list)</code>. If it's possible to implement something like that on return.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why would that be any different from importing it properly, and returning that? Except being much less readable.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I still don't understand what you actually want to import or what you want to return (but I still don't think you're trying to do something reasonable).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BlueMonday. Try: <code>return list(__import__('itertools').combinations(s, 2))</code>. But that is really nasty, so please don't actually do it ;-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see, I wouldn't use it, I wanted to know if it is possible to achieve something like that. Thanks.</span>
