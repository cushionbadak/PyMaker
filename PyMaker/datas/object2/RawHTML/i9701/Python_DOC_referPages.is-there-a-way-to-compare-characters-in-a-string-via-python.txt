<p>I am wondering if there is a way that I can compare the first letter of the string to the second; then the third to the forth ... etc.
At the moment I have this:</p>
<pre><code>a=0
b=0
string = "GG EZ"
if string[a:b] == string[a+1:b+1]:
    print("hello")
</code></pre>
<p>It works but is there a more efficient way of doing it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>zip</code> to pair up the elements</p>
<pre><code>s = "GGEZ"
for a, b in zip(*[iter(s)]*2):
    if a==b:
        print('Hello')
</code></pre>
<p>More on this usage of <code>zip</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>string = "GG EZ abbdff"

for i in range(0, len(string), 2):
    if string[i] == string[i+1]:
        print("characters match")
</code></pre>
<p>Create a range of every second character in the string. Iterate over the range and compare character at the index <code>i</code> with the following.</p>
<p>Edit: If your string length is an odd number you run into an out of range exception. I let you figure that one out by yourself :)</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>string[a] == string[a+1]</code> is shorter</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is your example all that you will be doing? Will you be comparing more than single letter substrings?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What i want to do is compare each character to the next in a loop until there isn't any characters left. In this example, I would want to print hello each time they match.</span>
