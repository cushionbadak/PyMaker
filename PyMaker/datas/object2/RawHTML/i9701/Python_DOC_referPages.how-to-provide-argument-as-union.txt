<p>Disclaimer: I don't have any Idea about c language</p>
<p>I am trying to make this thing work:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/berdario/resumable-urlretrieve" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/berdario/resumable-urlretrieve</a></p>
<p>here is the function:</p>
<pre><code>path = Union[str, Path]
urlretrieve(url: str, filename: path, reporthook=None, method='GET',
                sha256sum=None, filesize=None, headers=None,
                **kwargs) -&gt; Dict[str, str]:
</code></pre>
<p>How should I provide the filename?
I am seeing for the first time colon in the argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>Union</code> here has nothing to do with C or the kind of unions found in C. It just means that you can provide either a <code>str</code> or a <code>Path</code> for the <code>filename</code> argument... whatever a <code>Path</code> is in this context.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This has nothing to do with C and everything with <a href="/questions/32557920/what-are-type-hints-in-python-3-5">type hints</a>. Read it as <code>urlretrieve(url, filename, reporthook = False,</code> etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the advantage of using this programming style?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You know that you can give that function either a string or a path. Generally if you see a function you have no idea what arguments it takes, so the typing library (and <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">syntax</a>) gives you some possibilities to give some information there. If you want to say "give me either a string or a path, but nothing else" <code>Union</code> is the thing to do that.</span>
