<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I would like to add dynamic variable in the below URL-</p>
<pre><code>book_id = 33327 

resp_data = requests.get('http://example.com/book_id') 
</code></pre>
<p>How can achieve this in Django 1.9.6 (Python 2.7)?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Very simple:</p>
<pre><code>book_id = 33327
resp_data = requests.get('http://example.com/{}'.format(book_id))
</code></pre>
<p>The above example works for both Python 2 and 3. With Python 2 you can also use:</p>
<pre><code>resp_data = requests.get('http://example.com/%s' % book_id)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">% formatting is still perfectly well supported in Python 3, and is not deprecated.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@DanielRoseman I am not sure if it still recommended to use <code>%</code> over <code>format()</code> with Python 3. Could you confirm?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perhaps not deprecated, but the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a> hint that <code>format</code> is <i>preferred</i>. "Note The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and dictionaries correctly). Using the newer str.format() interface helps avoid these errors, and also provides a generally more powerful, flexible and extensible approach to formatting text."</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Of course, in this case, you could skip the format() and just do <code>requests.get('http://example.com/' + str(book_id))</code></span>
