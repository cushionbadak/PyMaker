<pre><code>i = 0

<p>Once finished it would say out of index/range. How would I get it to say ran out of numbers instead of an error?</p>
<p>I think it's called error handling.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can handle errors using try and except</p>
<pre><code>try:
   print(numbers[i])
except Exception:
   print("ran out of numbers")
</code></pre>
<p>Replacing <code>Exception</code> with the one you are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">receiving</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The stack trace tells you what exception to catch</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = ["1","1","1","1","1"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; while 0 == 0:
...    print(numbers[i])
...    i+=1
... 
1
1
1
1
1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;
IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>
<p>So add a try/except block</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers = ["1","1","1","1","1"]
&gt;&gt;&gt; try:
...     while 0 == 0:
...         print(numbers[i])
...         i += 1
... except IndexError:
...     print("Ran out of numbers!")
... 
1
1
1

1
Ran out of numbers!
</code></pre>
<p>But please go through some of the excellent python tutorials out there. This will be a painful way to learn the language!</p>

<p>Without modifying your code, you can <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#raising-exceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">raise a custom exception message</a> and then <code>break</code> to avoid the infinite loop:   </p>
<pre><code>i = 0
numbers = ["1","1","1","1","1"]
while 0 == 0:
   try:
      print(numbers[i])
      i+=1
   except IndexError:
      print('ran out of numbers')
      break
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Rather than <code>while</code>, I would use <code>for</code>.</p>
<pre><code>numbers = ["1","1","1","1","1"]
for n in numbers:
  print(n)
print("ran out of numbers")

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your loop condition is always true, therefore it prints each element 0-4, then tries to print the 6th element, which does not exist - thus an out of index/range error.
Try using a "for" loop instead.  Psuedocode: for x in numbers print(numbers[x])</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use <code>try..except</code>. Instead of <code>0 == 0</code>, you can just use <code>True</code>:</p>
<pre><code>i = 0
numbers = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

try:
    while True:
        print(numbers[i])
        i += 1
except IndexError:

<span class="comment-copy">for completeness, you may want to <code>break</code> after the <code>print</code> statement to avoid infinite loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@downshift - the try/except is outside of the while loop so there is no infinite loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">my mistake, thank you for correcting</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe... but OP says he wants to tell the user he ran out of numbers, not that he wants to avoid running out of numbers.</span>
