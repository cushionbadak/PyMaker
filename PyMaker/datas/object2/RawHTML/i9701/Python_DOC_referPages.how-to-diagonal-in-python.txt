<p>I do not understand what does the <code>atan2</code> method do. How is it calculating the angle? And why is there another method that calculates the distance?</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.atan2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Atan2</a> is simply Tan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">inverse</a> trignometric function which gives the output in radians. So, it is multiplied by 180/pi to convert it into degrees.</p>
<p><strong>dist</strong> is for calculating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Euclidean distance</a> between x and y.</p>
<p>And for the <strong>lt(t, angle)</strong> and <strong>rt(t, angle)</strong>, i can guess that they stand for Left Turn, by t degrees and Right Turn by t degress respectively.</p>

<p>In high school (liceo) I studied the inverse trigonometric functions, one of them the <code>arc tan(x)</code> or simply <code>atan(x)</code> — its meaning being, the angle <code>t</code> whose tangent is equal to <code>x</code>.  The implied limits are -infinity ≤ <code>x</code> ≤ + infinity  and -pi/2 ≤ <code>t</code> ≤ pi/2.</p>
<p>So, what is <code>atan2(x, y)</code>? It's a similar function that returns the angle <code>t</code>, -pi ≤ <code>t</code> ≤ pi, that is comprised between the unit vector in the horizontal direction and the vector <code>OP</code>, with <code>P=(x,y)</code>.</p>
<p>Why this fuction is called <code>atan2</code>? because it has TWO arguments (<code>atan</code> has a single argument) and because you can compute <code>atan2</code> using <code>atan</code></p>
<pre><code>atan2(x, y) &lt;equiv&gt; atan(y/x) or atan(y/x) ± pi
</code></pre>
<p>where you have to choose the particular solution based on the signs of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> — this logic is no difficult but someone (possibly the implementors of first FORTRAN compilers?) decided that it was a so common question that it deserved a function on its own.</p>
<p>Another feature of <code>atan2</code> is that the overflow that follows when <code>x==0</code> is completely avoided,</p>
