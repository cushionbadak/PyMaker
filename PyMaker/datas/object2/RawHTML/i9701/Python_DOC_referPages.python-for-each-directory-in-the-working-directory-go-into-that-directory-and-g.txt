<p>I need to make a script that will iterate through all the directories inside a directory. It should go into each directory, get its name and save it to a variable and comes back out, and then loops.</p>
<pre><code>    for dir in os.walk(exDir):
        path = dir
        os.chdir(path)
        source = #dir trimmed to anything after the last /
        os.chdir("..")
    loops
</code></pre>
<p>It needs to go into the directory to do other things not mentioned above. I've only just started Python and have been stuck on this problem for the last day or so. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For each iteration of your for loop, <code>dir</code> is a tuple of format <code>(filepath, subdirectories, files)</code>. As such <code>dir[0]</code> will give you the filepath.</p>
<p>It sounds like you just want to <code>os.chdir</code> for each folder recursively in <code>exDir</code> in which case the following will work:</p>
<pre><code>for dir in os.walk(exDir):
    os.chdir(dir[0])
    ...
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you read the documentation for <code>os.walk()</code>?   It returns a tuple.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/os.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@cdarke I hadn't looked closely enough clearly. Thanks for that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for that. Seems to be what I needed.</span>
