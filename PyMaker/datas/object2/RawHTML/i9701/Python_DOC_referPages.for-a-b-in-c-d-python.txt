<p>I have a list of keys and a list of values, I want to fill a dictionary so like:</p>
<pre><code> for key, value in listKeys, listValues:
     dict[key] = value
</code></pre>
<p>However, I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>builtins.ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>zip</code> function</a> to make a generator of <code>tuple</code>s of values from each of a number of inputs:</p>
<pre><code>mydict = {}
for key, value in zip(listKeys, listValues):
     mydict[key] = value
</code></pre>
<p>That said, you could skip the rigmarole of writing your own loop and let the <code>dict</code> constructor do the work; it can take an iterable of key/value pairs to initialize itself, and avoid the Python level loop entirely:</p>
<pre><code>mydict = dict(zip(listKeys, listValues))
</code></pre>
<p>or if <code>mydict</code> is an existing non-empty <code>dict</code>, use the <code>update</code> method, which accepts the same arguments as the constructor:</p>
<pre><code>mydict.update(zip(listKeys, listValues))
</code></pre>
<p>Side-note: I renamed your variable to <code>mydict</code>, because shadowing built-in names like <code>dict</code> is a terrible, terrible idea.</p>

<p>Use zip:</p>
<p><code>for key, value in zip(listKeys, listValues): dict[key] = value</code></p>

<p>Iterate through two lists simultaneously using <code>zip</code> :</p>
<pre><code>for key, value in zip(listKeys, listValues) :
    dict[key] = value

<span class="comment-copy">Why a down-vote ?! My reputation is not enough to do this, and down-voting is no way to give this information, a single comment is enough. Please lift the down-vote. @TigerhawkT3</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for this info, but my point is down-voting others' answer just to "punish" them for not knowing this info, is not OKAY. We all are learners here. @TigerhawkT3</span>
