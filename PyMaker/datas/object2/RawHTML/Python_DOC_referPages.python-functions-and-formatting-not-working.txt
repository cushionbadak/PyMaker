<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm currently having a problem with a function in python. This is my code before I tried putting it in a function:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(4):
    for y in Days:
      for x in "ABCDEF":
        data = input("What was the punctuality for bus " + x + " on " + str(y) + ", Week " + str(Week) + "? ")
        Bus = "Bus" + str(x)
        Buses[Bus].append(str(data))
        print()
    Week += 1
</code></pre>
<p>And it works like it is meant to, however I tried putting it in a function:</p>
<pre><code>def InputData():
  for i in range(4):
    for y in Days:
      for x in "ABCDEF":
        data = input("What was the punctuality for bus " + x + " on " + str(y) + ", Week " + str(Week) + "? ")
        Bus = "Bus" + str(x)
        Buses[Bus].append(str(data))
        print()
    Week += 1
</code></pre>
<p>And I am getting errors about the whole Week += 1 part. They say: </p>
<pre><code>[pyflakes] local variable 'Week' (defined in enclosing scope on line 11) 
referenced before assignment
[pyflakes] local variable 'Week' is assigned to but never used
</code></pre>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>Week = 0
</code></pre>
<p>Put this at the beginning of your code.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>Week += 1</code> that doesn't initialize to 0 automatically. Do it manually at start or use <code>global</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You initialized <code>Week</code> somewhere earlier in your first code. There is no initialization of a local variable <code>Week</code> in your function.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ro try <code>Week = Week + 1</code> but that's quite a hack</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This isn't the cause of your issue, but I noticed you're not following the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 8</a> Style Guide. I'd recommend doing so in the future. Specifically, your variable and function names should be in <code>snake_case</code>.</span>
