<p>So basically want to stop a script if an if statement is not met, the statement is this:abbrevationabbrevation</p>
<pre><code>if x &gt; 40 : print ("Please enter a number between 2 and 40")
</code></pre>
<p>If the user enters <code>41</code> for example, I don't want the program to continue running, but at the moment it does. </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>import sys

if (x &gt; 40):
    print ("Invalid input received. Exiting now")
    sys.exit()
else:
    # do the result of your program
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A simple solution could be to raise an exception that will ultimately stop your script from running</p>
<pre><code>if x &gt; 40 or x &lt; 2:
    raise Exception("Please enter a number between 2 and 40")
</code></pre>
<p>you can call <code>sys.exit()</code> which will raise <code>SystemExit</code> exception or raise the same exception to play safe</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As mad_ mentioned, you can just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#exit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">exit</a> from the sys module</p>
<pre><code>import sys
if x &gt; 40:
    sys.exit()
else:
    print('do something')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use a <code>break</code> statement. Simply put <code>break</code> in the if condition or the while loop</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Welcome to SO. Did you know if you copy/paste your post title verbatim into Google, you will have your answer?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Been looking for the last day before asking on here, can't find an answer. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">not using a function or while loop? then only option to exit from script would be <code>sys.exit()</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Tried that, problem is the rest of the script won't work if I do that, so if they enter a completely valid number like 20, it still won't work cause program told it to exit before it got to that point.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@LM <code>sys.exit()</code> should always be inside a condition otherwise rest of the code would automatically become unreachable</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is logically incorrect</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is backwards from what he wants.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My bad, I went straight to the point of the functionality on the title and not the actual requirement but hopefully the idea helps, and just fixed it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the "if not using function or while loop" in the title is because they already know about control flow tools like <code>return</code> and <code>break</code></span>
