<p>I have a few files in the folder and I want to find out the content and match its file name. But when I use re.search to achieve my goal I can only get ‘None’. Anyone could help?</p>
<pre><code>import re
xe = r'D:\ABC\cc123.xml'
re.search('cc*?.xml', xe)
</code></pre>

<p>(Though there is an accepted answer, I don't feel the answer is clear for other people, and there is still room to improve, so I added a new answer here)</p>
<p>The problem is simply OP is using a wrong regex: <code>cc*?.xml</code></p>
<p><code>*</code> means any occurrence of the <em>preceding</em> token (which means <code>c</code> in your case)
<code>*?</code> is a reluctant match any occurrence.
<code>.</code> means any character</p>
<p>Which means what you are trying to do is match a string which is:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <code>c</code></li>
<li>followed by any occurrence of c</li>
<li>followed by any character</li>
<li>followed by <code>xml</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Example of matching strings are <code>c.xml</code> <code>ccccccAxml</code> etc.</p>
<p>What you were trying to do, I believe is </p>
<pre><code>cc.*?\.xml
</code></pre>
<p>which means matching</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cc</code></li>
<li><code>.*?</code> : followed by any occurrence of any character, matching as few as possible</li>
<li><code>\.</code>  : followed by a dot  (note the difference of <code>\.</code> vs <code>.</code>)</li>
<li>followed by <code>xml</code></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>How about something like this with a small tweak?</p>
<pre><code>import re
xe = 'D:\ABC\cc123.xml'
print (re.search('cc.*?.xml', xe).group())
</code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre><code>cc123.xml
</code></pre>
