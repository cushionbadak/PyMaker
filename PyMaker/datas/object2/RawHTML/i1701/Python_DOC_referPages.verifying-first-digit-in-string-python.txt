<p>I am brand new to python and have searched the site on this, but still can't figure it out. It's for a homework assignment, so not looking for the answer, but I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong and getting a syntax error (I'm stuck on the first rule...) </p>
<p>The assignment:
W​e will assume that the credit card number is a string consisting of 14 characters and is in the format ####-####-####, including the dashes, where ‘#’ represents a digit between 0-9, so that there are 12 digits overall.
1. The first digit must be a 4. 
2. The fourth digit must be one greater than the fifth digit; keep in mind that these are separated by a dash since the format is ####-####-####. 
3. The sum of all digits must be evenly divisible by 4. 
4. If you treat the first two digits as a two-digit number, and the seventh and eighth digits as a two-digit number, their sum must be 100. </p>
<p>Here is my code so far. I've read that you can't compare characters to numbers, but nothing I've tried has worked. Any help/guidance would be appreciated!</p>
<pre><code>def verify(number) : 

if input ['0'] == '4'
  return True
if input ['0'] != '4'
  return "violates rule #1"

input = "4000-0000-0000" # change this as you test your function
output = verify(input) # invoke the method using a test input
print(output) # prints the output of the function
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>your code is fine, but there are a couple of issues</p>
<pre><code>def verify(number) : 

   if input [0] == '4':
     return True
   if input [0] != '4':
     return "violates rule #1"

input = "4000-0000-0000" # change this as you test your function
output = verify(input) # invoke the method using a test input
print(output) # prints the output of the function
</code></pre>
<p>first of all, indentation matters in python, everything that belongs in your function definition should be indented.</p>
<p>second, if statements should be followed by <code>:</code>. that is all</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your code is incorrect:</p>
<pre><code>def verify(number): 
# incorrect indent here
if input ['0'] == '4' # missing : and undeclared input variable, index should be int
   return True
if input ['0'] != '4'   # missing : and undeclared input variable, index should be int
  return "violates rule #1"
</code></pre>
<p>Fixed code:</p>
<pre><code>def verify(number):
    if number[0] != '4'
        return "violates rule #1"
    # other checks here
    return True
</code></pre>
<p>Also I recommend to return <code>False</code> from this function instead of error string. If you want to return string with error, consider using tuple like <code>(is_successful, error)</code> or custom object.</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" rel="nofollow noreferrer">string indexing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having
  index 0. There is no separate character type; a character is simply a
  string of size one:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; word = 'Python'
&gt;&gt;&gt; word[0]  # character in position 0 'P'
&gt;&gt;&gt; word[5]  # character in position 5 'n'
</code></pre>
<p>Then read about <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer">if-statements</a> - your code is missing the <code>:</code>, and the second <code>if</code> can be replaced by an <code>else</code> clause.</p>
<p>You may also want to check the argument of the function, not the global variable <code>input</code> (this is a bad name, since it shadows the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input()</code></a> built-in)</p>
<p>Suggested fix:</p>
<pre><code>def verify(number) : 
    if number[0] == '4':
        return True
    else:
        return "violates rule #1"

testinput = "4000-0000-0000" # change this as you test your function
output = verify(testinput) # invoke the method using a test input
print(output) # prints the output of the function
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Your indentation is incorrect. Please fix that and post the full traceback.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>input</code> is a builtin in python. Avoid using that name. Nothing in your function appears to ask for any <code>input</code> from the user</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>if input[0]</code>, not <code>input ['0']</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">To get the first character of a string, use <code>text[0]</code>, not <code>text['0']</code>.</span>
