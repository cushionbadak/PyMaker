<p>I am doing a CLI utility. When adding a docstring to call help for the module with the function <code>-- help</code> in console, I was faced with the fact that all the added text is displayed as a continuous, unbreakable message. How to separate strings from each other? I tried to add <code>\n</code> at the end of the line, but this does not work.</p>
<pre><code>def createParser():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        prog='samplefind',
        description="""
        Script to search for matches by word or lines in a text file and save the found information in a new outfile.txt file.
        From command line run python sfind.py .
        To view all available options: python sfind.py -h .
        """

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#argparse.RawTextHelpFormatter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>formatter_class=argparse.RawTextHelpFormatter</code></a> to retain all spaces in your help string. This is the <code>argparse</code> application help string, not a <code>docstring</code>. Could look a bit ugly though:</p>
<pre><code>parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        prog='samplefind',
        formatter_class=argparse.RawTextHelpFormatter,
        description="""
        Script to search for matches by word or lines in a text file and save the found information in a new outfile.txt file.
        From command line run python sfind.py .
        To view all available options: python sfind.py -h .
        """)
</code></pre>
<p>From terminal:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>py bla.py -h usage: samplefind [-h]</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>    Script to search for matches by word or lines in a text file and save the found information in a new outfile.txt file.
    From command line run python sfind.py .
    To view all available options: python sfind.py -h .
</code></pre>

<p>Do note that this include spaces from the beginning of line, new lines, everything.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That is not a <code>docstring</code> in the usual sense. Please change your title to <code>help</code> string in <code>argparse</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I do not know why but it does not work for me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@lepiloff In what way does it not work? Are you using an IDE? Did you try to <code>print(thefunc.__doc__)</code> and it did not produce newlines? Or use it in <code>help(thefunc)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print(thefunc.__doc__)</code> return None</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@lepiloff you completely changed the question. That is not a <code>docstring</code>. I will edit.</span>
