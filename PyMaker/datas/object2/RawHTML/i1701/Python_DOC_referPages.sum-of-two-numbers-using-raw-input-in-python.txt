<p>I want to perform this:</p>
<p>Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:</p>
<p>The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.</p>
<p>Can someone help me on this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Start slow and break it down</p>
<pre><code># Get your data from the user, use input
num_one = input("Please enter the first number: ")
num_two = input("Please enter the second number: ")

# Create the sum, diff, and product, casting as integer
sum = int(num_one) + int(num_two)
diff = int(num_one) - int(num_two)
product = int(num_one) * int(num_two)

# Print each output casting as a string since we can't concatenate a string to an integer
print("The sum is: "+str(sum))
print("The difference is: "+str(diff))
print("The product is: "+str(product))
</code></pre>
<p>Now you should also do some error checking here incase the user doesn't enter anything:</p>
<pre><code> # Get your data from the user, use input
num_one = input("Please enter the first number: ")
num_two = input("Please enter the second number: ")

if(num_one == "" or num_two == ""):
    print("You did not enter enter two numbers. Exiting...")
    exit
else:
    # Create the sum, diff, and product, casting as integer
    sum = int(num_one) + int(num_two)
    diff = int(num_one) - int(num_two)
    product = int(num_one) * int(num_two)

    # Print each output casting as a string since we can't concatenate a 
    string to an integer
    print("The sum is: "+str(sum))
    print("The difference is: "+str(diff))
    print("The product is: "+str(product))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried so far?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Start slow, break it down, but without spoon feeding them the solution. At least edit out the important parts and ask them to fill it in, or else they don't learn.</span>
