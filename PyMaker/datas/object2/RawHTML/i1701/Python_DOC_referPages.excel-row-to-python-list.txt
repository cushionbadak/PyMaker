<p>Assuming a csv file named test:</p>
<pre><code>with open("test.csv", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>Will print open the file in read-only mode then loop over the lines, storing each of them in the variable "line" and printing them. Read section 7.2 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for more details.</p>
