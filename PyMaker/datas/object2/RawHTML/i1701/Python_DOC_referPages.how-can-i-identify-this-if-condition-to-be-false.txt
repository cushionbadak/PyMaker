<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I need to identify if the string is at least 2 characters or else, they need to input the string again. The code doesn't work, what did I do wrong?</p>
<p>For example, I type "jason@yahoo.c":</p>
<pre><code>email_address = input('Enter your email address: ')

dns_label = email_address.split('.')
local = dns_label[0]
dns = dns_label[1]

if not len(local)&gt;=2 and len(dns)&gt;=2:
    email_address = input('''Your email address is incorrect.\n Please type your email address again: ''')
else:
    print(email_address,'is valid')
</code></pre>
<p>After the dot it only has 1 character, so it will ask the user again for the input.
What did I do wrong?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>not</code> operator has <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">higher precedence</a> over <code>and</code>, therefore you must put the expression into brackets:</p>
<pre><code>if not (len(local) &gt;= 2 and len(dns) &gt;= 2):
</code></pre>
<p>or better, remove the <code>not</code> altogether to make it more readable:</p>
<pre><code>if len(local) &lt; 2 or len(dns) &lt; 2:
</code></pre>
<p>Edit: That being said, an <code>if</code> clause is not sufficient for input validation as it will only check the entry once. What if the user types an incorrect email address the second time too?

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, the code is running after I changed into while loops. Very helpful</span>
