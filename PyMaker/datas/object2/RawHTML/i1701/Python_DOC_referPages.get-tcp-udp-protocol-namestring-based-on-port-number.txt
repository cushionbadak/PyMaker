<p>The question could apply to any <em>web oriented</em> language.</p>
<p>As the title says, I would like string based on the port number:</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>protocol = get_protocol_name(22)
print protocol
</code></pre>
<p>This should print out "ssh". A more verbosed version would make sense:</p>
<pre><code>protocol = get_protocol_name(21, true)
print protocol
</code></pre>
<p>Could return print out "File Transfer Protocol". </p>
<p>The function has no complexity, the purpose of the question <strong>is not</strong> how the code would be, but if there is any implementation already embedded in the languages.</p>

<p>Have a look at python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.getservbyport" rel="nofollow noreferrer">socket module</a></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import socket
&gt;&gt;&gt; socket.getservbyport(23)
'telnet'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">this has nothing to do with javascript and php, I removed the tags and my edit got accepted, so that seems to be the "right" way. why did you re-add them?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Read the first sentence of the question, I just put the examples in python but the question applies to any language.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">by that logic, you'd have to add every language tag there is (you didn't)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Feel free to add them, I am interested if there is a solution in those languages as well. Other option is to spam stackoverflow with the same question for each language...</span>
