<p>Running a simple program that accepts two inputs, an input file, and a word to search for. It then should print out all lines that contain the word. For example, my input file contains 5 sentences as follows:</p>
<pre><code>My cat is named garfield
He is my first Cat
My mom is named cathy
This is a catastrophe
Hello how are you
</code></pre>
<p>The word I want to check for is cat</p>
<p>This is the code I wrote:</p>
<pre><code>input_file = sys.argv[1]
input_file = open(input_file,"r")
wordCheck = sys.argv[2]

for line in input_file:
    if wordCheck in line:
        print line

input1.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Now obviously, this will return lines 1, 3, and 4, because they all contain "cat" at some point. My question is, how would I work it so that only line 1 (the only line with just the word "cat") would be printed?</p>
<p>Second question is, what would be the best way to get all lines that had the word "cat" in them, disregarding case. So in this situation, you would return lines 1 and 2, because they contain "cat" and "Cat" respectively. Thanks in advance. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">regular expressions</a> for that:</p>
<pre><code>import re

# '\b': word boundary, re.I: case insensitive 
pat = re.compile(r'\b{}\b'.format(wordCheck), flags=re.I)

for line in input_file:
    if pat.search(line):
        print line
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here's a short way of doing it, use <code>in</code> on a list of words instead of string directly.</p>
<pre><code>word = 'cat'
for line in lines:
    if word in line.split(' '): # use `in` on a list of all the words of that line.
        print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>Outputs:
<code>My cat is named garfield</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For your first question, you can use <code>break</code> statement to stop the loop after getting the first match</p>
<pre><code>for line in input_file:
    if wordCheck in line.split(' '):
        print line
        break # add break here
</code></pre>
<p>For your second question, you could user <code>lower()</code> function to convert everything into lower case, so that <code>Cat</code> and <code>cat</code> would be detected.</p>
<pre><code>for line in input_file:
    if wordCheck in line.lower().split(' '):
        print line
</code></pre>
