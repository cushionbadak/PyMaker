but i got following errors</p>
<pre><code>with io.open('http:\\localhost:3000\\assets\\i18n\\locale-ru.json', 'w') as outfile:
</code></pre>
<p><code>IOError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument: 'http:\\localhost:3000\\assets\\i18n\\locale-ru.json'</code></p>
<p>Here is a piece of code:</p>
<pre><code> with io.open('http://localhost:3000//assets//i18n//locale-ru.json', 'w') as outfile:
  str_ = json.dumps(data_ru,
                    indent=4, sort_keys=True,
                    separators=(',', ': '), ensure_ascii=False)
  outfile.write(to_unicode(str_))
</code></pre>

<p>According to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doc</a>, the <code>io.open</code> function only reads a local file given a file path. Considering you're trying to read from a http url, I guess a better tools might be <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">requests</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Just a note, you have only one slash after `http:`.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">with io.open('http:/localhost:3000//assets//i18n//locale-ru.json', 'w') as outfile: IOError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument: 'http:/localhost:3000//assets//i18n//locale-ru.json'</span>

<span class="comment-copy">what about urllib.urlopen in Python 2.7</span>
<span class="comment-copy">` with urllib.urlopen('<a href="http://localhost:3000//assets/i18n//locale-kg.json" rel="nofollow noreferrer">localhost:3000//assets/i18n//locale-kg.json</a>', 'w') as outfile:       str_ = json.dumps(data_kg,                         indent=4, sort_keys=True,                         separators=(',', ': '), ensure_ascii=False)       outfile.write(to_unicode(str_))`</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As far as I know, to update a file via HTTP you have to send a POST or a PUT request with a file on your local, just like you upload a file to some website. So if I wanted to update a file via an URL, I would firstly download it to my local, then do changes on it, and finally upload the file back. As for file uploading, you could refer <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/26791188/2191173">stackoverflow.com/a/26791188/2191173</a> for details.</span>
