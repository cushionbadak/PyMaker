<p><code>B</code> is a quadratic matrix of size <code>k</code>.</p>
<p>I tried the following code</p>
<p><code>if [x for x in range(k) if B[x,1] == 1]:</code></p>
<p>to get:</p>
<p>For the first <code>x</code> in <code>range(k-1)</code>, for which <code>B[x,1] == 1</code>, stop the for-loop and return <code>true</code>, such that the if-statement can be executed. If there is no such <code>x</code>, then return <code>false</code> and go on in the following code.</p>

<p>Looks like you want <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>if any(B[x,1] == 1 for x in range(k)):

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53266061">arshajii's answer</a> is probably right, but if you also want to have the value of the first <code>x</code> fulfilling your condition you could do:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    x = next(x for x in range(k) if B[x, 1] == 1)
    # Do something with x
except StopIteration:
    # Do something else
</code></pre>
<hr/>
<p>EDIT: Better yet, thanks @arshajii:</p>
<pre><code>x = next(x for x in range(k) if B[x, 1] == 1, None)
if x is not None:
    # Do something with x
else:
    # Do something else
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What's a <code>quadratic matrix of size k</code>? Can you provide a <b><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a></b>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use list comprehension only if you're interested in creating a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Does the for-loop stop as soon as the condition is fulfilled for the first x?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user4309 Yes <code>any()</code> will do exactly that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can also use <code>x = next((x for x in range(k) if B[x, 1] == 1), None)</code> then check if  <code>x</code> is <code>None</code> instead of catching an exception.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@arshajii I always forget about that one and it's so much better, thanks!</span>
