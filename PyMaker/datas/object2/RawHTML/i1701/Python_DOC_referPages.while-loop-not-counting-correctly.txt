<p>I've been learning programming in python for the last two weeks and it's going great so far. But now I'm stuck and can't seem to find an answer.
I found a really weird behaviour of a while loop, I just can't wrap my head around.</p>
<pre><code>x=0
step_size=0.2

while x&lt;2:
    print x
    x+=step_size
</code></pre>
<p>This code prints:</p>
<pre><code>0
0.2
0.4
...
1.8
2.0
</code></pre>
<p>2.0 should not be printed, right? When x becomes 2.0 the statement "x&lt;2" is false, therefore the loop should exit and never print 2.0.</p>
<p>And now for the really weird part: it works with other numbers. Step_size=0.4 prints up to 1.6, step_size=0.1 up to 1.9.
Using "x&lt;1" as a statement and step_size=0.2 also works.</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>
<p>Best regards,
Leo</p>
<p>Edit: I'm using python 2.7.5 and the default Idle Editior v2.7.5</p>
