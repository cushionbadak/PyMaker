<p>I'm using  python 3.6 math.log() function to get natural logarithm of an array of 4381 records. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WNwWrb_qPSDieODKAT-f7vnpPtiaJ6ac/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here is my complete array</a> </p>
<p>I'm using following code in python to get natural log</p>
<pre><code>math.log(a)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm getting error message as <code>TypeError: must be real number, not GKVariable</code>
For the same number I can able to do natural logarithm in excel.Can you suggest me how to resolve this issue</p>

<p>Check the documentation:
[<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html][1]" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html][1]</a></p>
<p>The <code>math.log()</code> function receive as argument a number, and not a list of numbers.</p>
<p>I don't understand why you are getting a <code>TypeError: must be real number, not GKVariable</code>, I'm getting <code>TypeError: must be real number, not list</code>\</p>
<p>In any case, you can just do:</p>
<pre><code>result = [math.log(i) for i in a]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>math.log</code> takes a float as input. You gave it a list. Numpy's log can handle numpy arrays:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
a=np.array(YOUR_LIST)
loga = np.log(a)
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't want to use numpy, you will have to use list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>loga = [math.log(i) for i in a]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@Prune. I didn't want to put link to an off site.But I could not able to add all the numbers here as it was crossing maximum limit of SO. It's midnight in my time zone. I need to solve this by morning tomorrow. So I wanted to put the complete array here so that experts from SO can able to guide me a solution.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Again, refer to the MCVE description.  You should be able to reproduce the problem for us with a small subset of your list.

<span class="comment-copy">What do you want to with log after? As it says <code>log</code> takes number, not... idk what is GKVariable. You might use <code>logs = [math.log(i) for i in a]</code>.</span>
