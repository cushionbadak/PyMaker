<p>How do I convert a Python memoryview to bytes?</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; convert(memoryview(b"test"))
b"test"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python's memoryview has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#memoryview.tobytes" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tobytes()</code></a> method that allows you to do just that. You're also able to call <code>bytes()</code> on the object.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that converting a memoryview object to bytes copies the data, and you're able to use memoryview in most places either way. I wouldn't suggest you to convert.</p>
