<p>For a project I have a <strong>several lists</strong> of songs and artists and I need to store the lists into a <strong>textfile</strong> before doing anything else.
This is my code:</p>
<pre><code>BTS = ["Idol", "BTS"]
SWIFTY = ["Love Story", "Taylor Swift"]
RUTH = ["Lost Boy", "RuthB"]
ED = ["Perfect", "Ed Sheeran"]
ARIANA = ["No Tears Left To Cry", "Ariana Grande"]
DRAKE = ["In My Feeling", "Drake"]
RICKY = ["La Vida Loca", "Ricky Martin"]
IU = ["BBIBBI", "IU"]
MJACKSON = ["Thriller", "Michael Jackson"]
PSY = ["Gangnam Style", "PSY"]
</code></pre>
<p>How do I <strong>store all of these into one text file?</strong>
Then how do I randomly select one of those lists and <strong>only output</strong> the song or artist <strong>not both</strong> as the user has the guess the other <em>e.g Thriller is output and the user inputs Michael Jackson</em></p>

<p>I prefer using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python dictionary</a> to store your data, then save it as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">json format</a>. Then you can read it back simply as follows:</p>
<pre><code>import json
import random


songs = dict((
         ["Idol", "BTS"],
         ["Love Story", "Taylor Swift"],
         ["Lost Boy", "RuthB"],
         ["Perfect", "Ed Sheeran"],
         ["No Tears Left To Cry", "Ariana Grande"],
         ["In My Feeling", "Drake"],
         ["La Vida Loca", "Ricky Martin"],
         ["BBIBBI", "IU"],       
         ["Thriller", "Michael Jackson"],
         ["Gangnam Style", "PSY"] 
         ))


songs = json.dumps(songs)
f = open("dict.json","w")
f.write(songs)
f.close()

f = open("dict.json","r")
songs = f.read()
f.close()

songs = json.loads(songs)

choice = random.choice(list(songs.keys()))
print(choice)
print(songs[choice])
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>La Vida Loca
Ricky Martin
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">How about store it all in a dictionary instead then save as JSON, select a random key then randomly output either key or value?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what have you tried so far?</span>
