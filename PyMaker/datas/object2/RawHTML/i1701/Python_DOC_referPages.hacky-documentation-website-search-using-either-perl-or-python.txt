<p>I have a test coming up where we have been provided full access to perl5 and python3 documentation. The problem the search feature in these documentations have been disabled as I guess it uses the internet to get results.[Exam environment, the internet is disabled] </p>
<p>I was hoping if I could write a hacky/ make-shift website documentation search to use during the exam.[I will learn and reproduce the code in exam and then use it NOT carry it on a device or something]</p>
<p>All the resources available online either reference external libraries or implement sophisticated ranking searches. Which is not practical for my purpose.</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<ol>
<li>The documentation is hosted on the university domain</li>
<li>I have access to Perl5, Python3.6, python2.7, Vanilla JS</li>
</ol>
<p>Requirement:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search website for the keyword</li>
<li>display links based on the frequency of the said keyword</li>
</ol>
<p>I would appreciate if you could point me to appropriate resources or give advice as to how to approach this. </p>
<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong>
I am on some sort of a private network. So WGET works to pull the website but links pointing to external download sources are disabled, I can only access links that point to locations within the docs.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong>
I ended up using perldocs had a hard time looking for stuff but it was better than alternatives and best available. </p>

<p>Why don't you build the docs yourself with sphinx?</p>
<p>Just take python repo <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Doc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Doc</a> and run the sphinx, then you can also apply any theme you like: python-docs-theme, rtd-theme.</p>

<p>I think the best way for you would be to download the docs for offline use;</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/archives/python-3.6.7-docs-html.zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3.6/archives/python-3.6.7-docs-html.zip</a></p>
<p>You can then search the documentation offline aswell.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Note that you can use perldoc and pydoc from the command line. However, some Perl installations omit the documentation, and pydoc is only a frontend for the <code>help()</code> system â€“ it only shows the docstrings and introspects the structure of modules/classes, but does not show the full documentation.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>perldoc</code> command line tool gives access to Perl docs. Depending on command-line options, it can bring up specific perl doc pages, docs on modules, specific functions or special vars.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I will get the copy on docs during the exam. I cannot take material into the exam.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should also be able to rebuilt the docs from sources because sphinx web contains it's sources in <code>_sources</code> eg: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/_sources/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/_sources</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Download option has been blocked. I can do wget and stuff no internet access and since the link you provided is hosted outside, I don't have access to it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how can you "do wget and stuff " without internet access?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what does "Download option has been blocked" mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you not just download the html docs then just upload the docs to the uni domain?</span>
