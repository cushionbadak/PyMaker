<p>I have a problem with the <code>read()</code> function in Python, it just doesn't read the file:</p>
<pre><code>with open("D:\\Joseph\\pythontest.txt", "w+") as f:
 f.write("Hello World")
 print(f.read())
</code></pre>
<p>It doesn't show anything in the output (not even an error), just finishes the program.</p>

<p>You are writing to the file, but you didn't go back in the file. The "cursor" is located after what you wrote.</p>
<p>Try <code>f.seek(0)</code> to go at the beginning of your file after writing to it.</p>

<p>Your code is trying to write it as you have ”w+” as a second param of open() call. Please use the open without the second parameter.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Files don't work the way you seem to think—their contents can't be randomly written and read the way you're trying to do it.
