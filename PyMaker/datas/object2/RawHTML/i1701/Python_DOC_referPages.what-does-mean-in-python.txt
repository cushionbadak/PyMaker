<p>All,</p>
<p>Can you please tell me what this line means in Python?  I don't know if I'm using it properly.  </p>
<p>def read_places_file(filename) -&gt; List[PlaceInformation]: </p>
<p>We are defining a method that takes a parameter called, 'filename'.  And then what does the rest of the line mean?  What does the '-&gt;' operator mean?  </p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.  </p>

<p>Those are <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">type annotations</a> indicating the format of the function's output.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">They are type hints, they allow IDE's and other tools to better analyze and infer types, and allow for things like autocompletion. See <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 484</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, I think I understand.  So, after the function is run, the 'return' should be a list of 'PlaceInformation" objects?</span>
