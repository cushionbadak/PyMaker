<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I need to separate texts into paragraphs and be able to work with each of them. How can I do that? Between every 2 paragraphs can be at least 1 empty line. Like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Hello world,
  this is an example.

Let´s program something.

</code></pre>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This sould work:</p>
<pre><code>text.split('\n\n')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try</p>
<pre><code>result = list(filter(lambda x : x != '', text.split('\n\n')))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I usually strip before split then filter out the ''. ;)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Assuming the text is in a text file. Read the file line wise and whenever you encounter a blank line, you know that whatever was above that line belonged to a paragraph. Extend this similarly for upcoming text.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is clear for me, but I need a help with syntax, how to write this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kom20 do you know how to open a file and read a line? What difficultly do you have specifically ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I know this, but I need to align all paragraphs for set width of characters and for that I need to separate paragraphs from the text and work with each individually.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.splitlines" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.splitlines()</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, it seems good. But since the end of the text consists of some empty lines, last items in this list are empty (like this): ["something","",""]. Can this make any problem as soon as I get into work with the particular words in these paragraphs?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is for you to say. You can always filter them out with <code>filter(None, ...)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">While this might answer the authors question, it lacks some explaining words and/or links to documentation. Raw code snippets are not very helpful without some phrases around them. You may also find <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-answer">how to write a good answer</a> very helpful.
