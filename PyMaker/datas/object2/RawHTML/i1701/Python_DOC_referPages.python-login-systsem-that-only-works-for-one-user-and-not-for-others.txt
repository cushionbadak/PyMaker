<p>The format in the file looks like this `Username: john password: psw123 '</p>
<p>When I put multiple users in to the file and then try the code it sayes the username and password it correct and incorrect for some reason</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>First, let's analyze a part of your code.  </p>
<p>The condition in your command</p>
<pre><code>if line.strip() == "Username: "+username and "Password: "+password:
</code></pre>
<p>is possible to write with parentheses (by the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="nofollow noreferrer">operator precedence</a>) as</p>
<pre><code>(line.strip() == ("Username: " + username)) and ("Password: " + password)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the right-hand operator of the resulting <code>and</code> operation</p>
<pre><code>("Password: " + password)
</code></pre>
<p>is a <em>nonempty string</em>, and - consequently - evaluated as <code>True</code> (see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Boolean operations</a>), which makes your <code>if</code> statement the same as</p>
<pre><code>if line.strip() == "Username: " + username
</code></pre>
<p>and, consequently, the password is never checked.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Now, to the logic of your program:</p>
<p>In your input file you don't have the words <em>"Username: "</em> and <code>"Password: "</code>, but something as</p>
<pre><code>JohnDoe: pswd123
</code></pre>
<p>so the string literals <code>"Username: "</code> and <code>"Password: "</code> are totally inappropriate in your <code>if</code> statements. You wanted compare the <em>entered</em> username with the username <em>in your file</em>, and the <em>entered</em> password with the password <em>in your file</em>, in our example something like</p>
<pre><code>if (username == "JohnDoe") and (password == "pswd123"):
</code></pre>
<p>or - following the format of lines in your input file - </p>
<pre><code>if (username + ": " + password) == "JohnDoe: pswd123":
</code></pre>
<p>The right-hand part of <code>==</code> is simply <em>the line of your input file</em>, so your <code>if</code> statement may look as</p>
<pre><code>if (username + ": " + password) == line:
</code></pre>
<p>so the (corrected) code of your program becomes</p>
<pre><code>username = input("Enter username: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")

with open("myfile.txt") as username_finder:
    for line in username_finder:
        if (username + ": " + password) == line.strip():
            print("Correct")
            break;            # No need to search other lines   
    else:
        print("Sorry, this username or password does not exist")
</code></pre>
<p>Note the <code>else</code> branch of the <code>for</code> loop - it will perform only in the case when the loop is <em>naturally exhausted</em>, not interrupted by the <code>break</code> statement - see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The for statement</a> in the documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If the file just contains the usernames and passwords, not the words <code>Username:</code> and <code>Password</code>, you should you should not have those strings in your equality check. It should be:</p>
<pre><code>if line.strip() == username + ":" + password:
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you should not print that the name is not found in the <code>else</code> condition. The input will only match one line in the file, you'll print an error message for every other line. You should break out of the loop when you find a match, and print the error message in the <code>else:</code> clase of the <code>for</code> loop. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42913798/searching-array-reports-not-found-even-though-its-found/42913882#42913882">Searching array reports "not found" even though it's found</a></p>
<p>If you want to keep asking for the password until it's correct put everything in a loop.</p>
<pre><code>check_failed = True
while check_failed:
    username = input("Enter username: ")
    password = input("Enter password: ")

    with open("myfile.txt") as username_finder:
        for line in username_finder:
            if (username + ": " + password) == line.strip():
                print("Correct")
                check_failed = False
                break;
        else:
            print("Sorry, this username or password does not exist")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>and "Password: "+password</code> will always succeed, since the truthiness of a non-empty string is always true.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what do u mean?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>for lines in username_finder:</code> should be <code>for line in username_finder:</code> without this typo I get expected behavior, can you show how you get both correct and incorrect output? Can you also show an example <code>Username: Password</code> line in the <code>myfile.txt</code>? The description suggests there are no data labels, but the code suggests there are data labels.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bob786 python if statements don't work like english. The line should be <code>if line.strip() == "Username: "+username and line.strip() == "Password: "+password:</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JoyalMathew How can that be right? How can the line be equal to two different strings?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for solving this for me and i understand what u are saying and now it makes a lot of more sense</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also one more question say that the input in the file is this                         username: JohnDoe password: pswd123                                                                      how would u make the code find the username password this way</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Change the part <code>if (username + ": " + password)</code> to <code>if ("username: " + username + " password: " + password)</code>. Note the space symbol in "username: " and 2 space symbols in " password: ".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how would i loop it if they got the username or password wrong?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure I understand you, but I'll try to answer you anyway. How the program find out that the combination username/password is wrong? Only by exhausting the input file, i. e. the <code>for</code> loop. In which situation the <code>else:</code> branch will take on its role.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">how would i loop it if they got the username or password wrong?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Put the code in a <code>while True:</code> loop. When they get the password correct, use <code>break</code> to get out of the loop.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">could you please actually show me the code with the loop in it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Seriously? I added it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks its just that im new to python</span>
