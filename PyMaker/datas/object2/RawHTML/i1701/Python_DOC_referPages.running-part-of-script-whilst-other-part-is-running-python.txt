<p>How am I able to run my line of code in the background whilst other part is running.I only want to run it from IDLE without the CLI. I want it something like this. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Multiprocessing</a> library to achieve this.</p>
<pre><code>from playsound import playsound
from multiprocessing import Process


process_for_sound = Process(target=playsound, args=('The Music which i want run in the background',))
process_for_sound.start()
process_for_sound.join()

<span class="comment-copy">That is really helpful. How could I do it if I wanted to run something in the background other than playing music.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can call any function of your choice by using this method. Please refer to the docs for much more advanced features.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have tried your solution but only goes to concurrent code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is the solution that I've used for a similar problem of mine. If you could give a better explanation of what is required, I might be able to help you</span>
