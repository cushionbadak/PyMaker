<p>The code that I'm trying to execute:</p>
<pre><code>print "Creating account %s with the password %s" % (username1, password1)

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are using Python 3.  You need parentheses to call the print function:</p>
<pre><code>print("Creating account %s with the password %s" % (username1, password1))
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It seems you are using python 3 ,so please put print() parenthesis if using python 3 in print statement.
Please refer the documentation.
