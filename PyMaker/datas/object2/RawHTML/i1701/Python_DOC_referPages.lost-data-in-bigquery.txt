<p>I made a Python 3 script to process some CSV files, but I have a problem with the data.</p>
<p>I send to the stream with the <a href="https://googleapis.github.io/google-cloud-python/latest/cbigquery/generated/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.html?highlight=insert_rows#google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client.insert_rows" rel="nofollow noreferrer">insert_rows</a> function, if I only import  one file I have the same rows in the CSV and the BigQuery, but when I import more files, BigQuery lost rows respect CSV file, but insert_rows don't  return errors. </p>
<pre><code>errors = connection.client.insert_rows(table_ref, info, selected_fields=schema)  # API request
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks for the help         </p>

<p>Issue was fixed by adding a new unique column into the CSV file, using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this Python Standard Library</a> to generate a new column and add in all rows an unique id.</p>
