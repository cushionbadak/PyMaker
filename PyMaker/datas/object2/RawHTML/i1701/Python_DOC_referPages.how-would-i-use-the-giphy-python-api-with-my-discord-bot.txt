<p>From my understanding I can use this example from the GIPHY docs (<a href="https://gyazo.com/1b6c0094162a54fe49029f665badf8df" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://gyazo.com/1b6c0094162a54fe49029f665badf8df</a>) to open a url but I don't understand it too much. To add onto that, when I run this code I get the error: </p>
<p>discord.ext.commands.errors.CommandInvokeError: Command raised an exception: 
AttributeError: module 'urllib' has no attribute 'urlopen'</p>
<p>My question is how can I randomly import a GIF from certain tags once the user types #giphy in a text channel </p>
<p>Here is my current code: (Code got updated)</p>
<pre><code>@bot.command(pass_context = True)
@commands.cooldown(1, 3, commands.BucketType.user)
async def gif(ctx, *, search):
channel = ctx.message.channel
session = aiohttp.ClientSession()

msg = await bot.send_message(channel, "**searching for " + search + "..**")
randomMessage = await bot.send_message(channel, "**showing a random image due to no images found from your search or you just didn't search anything**")

if search == "":
    randomImage = True
    print("random")
    randomMessage
    response = await session.get("https://api.giphy.com/v1/gif/random?api_keyY=4hnrG09EqYcNnv63Sj2gJvmy9ilDPx5&amp;limit=10")
else:
    msg
    print("searching")
    correct_search = search.replace(" ", "+")
    reponse = await session.get("http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=" + correct_search + "&amp;api_key=Y4hnrG09EqYcNnv63Sj2gJvmy9ilDPx5&amp;limit=10")
data = json.loads(await reponse.text())
await session.close()

embed = discord.Embed(
    description = '**showing result for ' + search + '**',
    colour = discord.Colour.blue()
)

gif_choice = random.randint(0,9)
embed.set_image(url=data["data"][gif_choice]["images"]["original"]["url"])
if randomImage:
    await bot.delete_message(randomMessage)
else:
    await bot.delete_message(msg)

await bot.send_message(channel, embed=embed)
</code></pre>
<p>Thank you</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The response that the API gives is formatted as json. You need to parse through it to find the url you wish to embed. After it has loaded, it will be a dictionary in python.</p>
<p>The below code is an example of how to do this. It will make a call to the giphy API and return the first 10 results and will randomly select a result as a message.</p>
<p>Note that <code>aiohttp</code> is used as it is asynchronous, meaning it will not block your code. I have also modified the command so that you can search for anything. To match your previous request url, you can use <code>!giphy ryan gosling</code>. If the user does not specify a value for search, then the giphy random endpoint will be used instead.</p>
<pre><code>from discord.ext import commands
import discord
import json
import aiohttp
import random

client = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')


@client.command(pass_context=True)
async def giphy(ctx, *, search):
    embed = discord.Embed(colour=discord.Colour.blue())
    session = aiohttp.ClientSession()

    if search == '':
        response = await session.get('https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=API_KEY_GOES_HERE')
        embed.set_image(url=data['data']['images']['original']['url'])
    else:
        search.replace(' ', '+')
        response = await session.get('http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=' + search + '&amp;api_key=API_KEY_GOES_HERE&amp;limit=10')
        gif_choice = random.randint(0, 9)
        embed.set_image(url=data['data'][gif_choice]['images']['original']['url'])

    data = json.loads(await response.text())
    await session.close()

    await client.send_message(embed=embed)

client.run('token')
</code></pre>
<p>Also, it seems that discord natively supports giphy. While I was testing, it already made it's own giphy calls. I've tested this using some different characters (!, ~, ') and space and it seems to always work. See below examples.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you try phrasing your question in the form of a question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oops I completely forgot to ask the question LOL</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do your import look like?  You're probably looking for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.urlopen" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>urllib.request.urlopen</code></a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have updated my code and fixed my import but i still can't seem to get it to work. It outputs:             (file paths) line 96, in giphy     await bot.send_message(channel, embed=embed)   File "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python36_64\lib\site-packages\discord\client.py", line 1152, in send_message     data = yield from self.http.send_message(channel_id, content, guild_id=guild_id, tts=tts, embed=embed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks so much! I didn't know that discord had supported giphy like this and to be honest its pretty cool. Since I couldn't find any way to bypass discord automatically trying to change your text to a giphy url whenever you type giphy at the beginning of the sentence i decided to change the command to #gif and now it works perfectly fine! Just one more thing to ask, how can I randomly search for gifs if the user didnt type anything to search?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry for asking a lot of questions, I'm still learning python and this really helped me a lot, but the more I test the command I notice that the gifs that are shown are always the same gifs. Ex. if i search for "terry" the only gif that pops up, no matter how many times i search for terry, is him shouting "My acrylics!". Another thing I noticed is that I cannot add spaces to my searches. Ex. searching up Terry Crews results in an error, how can I replace the space with a _?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've edited my answer to include a your two scenarios. The random endpoint is used if no search is specified. If it is specified, then 10 results are returned and one is randomly chosen. The command as it is above caters for spaces already. This is done with the * character included in <code>async def giphy(ctx, *, search):</code>. Without it you cannot use spaces or you have have to wrap your arguments in quotes, for example <code>!giphy "Terry Crews"</code>. Documentation here: <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#why-do-my-arguments-require-quotes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks the different results work, there's just one thing, i still cant search for terry crews. I have updated my original post to show what I currently have. The following error is what shows up: raise CommandInvokeError(e) from e discord.ext.commands.errors.CommandInvokeError: Command raised an exception: KeyError: 'data'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The url cannot have spaces in it. All spaces must be replaced with <code>+</code>. You need something like <code>search.replace(' ', '+')</code>. Also, lists start at index 0, not 1. So if you return 10 results, you have index 0 to 9 (which is 10). With <code>random.randint(1,10)</code> as you have it, you will never get the first result (index 0) and your code will error if it chooses 10 (no 10 index)</span>
