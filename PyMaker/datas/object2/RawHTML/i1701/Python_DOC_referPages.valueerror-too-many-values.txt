<p>I am going through a python tutorial.  I typed in exactly what the tutorial has but it won't run.  I think the issue is the tutorial uses Python 2 something  and i am using Python 3.5. For instance the tutorial does not use parenthesis after the print and i have to and it uses raw_input where i use just input. </p>
<p>This is what i am trying to run-</p>
<pre><code>def sumProblem(x, y): 
    print ('The sum of %s and %s is %s.' % (x, y, x+y))


def main(): 
    sumProblem(2, 3) 
    sumProblem(1234567890123, 535790269358) 
    a, b = input("Enter two comma separated numbers: ") 
    sumProblem(a, b)


main()
</code></pre>
<p>This is the error i receive:</p>
<pre><code>ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 2)
</code></pre>
<p>If i put just two numbers with out  a comma it will concatenate them.  I have tried to change to integer but it gives this error: </p>
<pre><code>ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 
</code></pre>
<p>When i searched it on here the answers did not seem to apply to my problem, they were much more involved or i didn't understand. </p>

<p><code>input(..)</code> returns a <em>string</em>. A string is an iterable, so you <em>can</em> unpack this with:</p>
<pre><code>a, b = input("Enter two comma separated numbers: ") 
</code></pre>
<p>but only if the string contains exactly <em>two</em> items. So for a string this means that the string contains exactly two characters.</p>
<p>The code however hints that you want to input two integers. We can use <code>str.split()</code> to split the string into a list of "words".</p>
<p>We then can perform a <code>map</code>ping with <code>int</code> as function:</p>
<pre><code>def sumProblem(x, y): 
    print ('The sum of %s and %s is %s.' % (x, y, x+y))
def main(): 
    sumProblem(2, 3) 
    sumProblem(1234567890123, 535790269358) 
    a, b = <b>map(int, </b>input("Enter two comma separated numbers: ")<b>.split(','))</b>
    sumProblem(a, b)
main()</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your input should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>a, b = map(int, input('text:').split(','))
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>input</code></a> returns a single line of input - a string. Parsing it is left to you.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@chepner: yes, I somehow realized that at the same time, thanks.</span>
