<p>Python mode for Processing <a href="https://py.processing.org/tutorials/python-jython-java/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">is built on Jython, and Jython still hasn't crawled out of the Python 2 era</a> (it only moved to Python 2.7 compatibility, from 2.5, in 2015, half a decade after 2.7 released).</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choices" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.choices</code> was introduced in Python 3.6</a>; even if Python mode for Processing offered full access to all Python features (and I have a hard time determining if it does), Jython's 2.7 compatibility means it has almost no features introduced after Python 3.1, so <code>random.choices</code> is not available without reimplementing it from scratch. Of course, the code for <code>random.choices</code> <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0eaf7b975bd61169a8d78945d2d12f23299f61a8/Lib/random.py#L344" rel="nofollow noreferrer">is open source and posted online</a>, so you could always just backport it to Python 2 yourself (along with <code>itertools.accumulate</code>, which it relies on).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It doesn't look like this is really Python at all. <a href="https://py.processing.org/reference/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The reference on mentions a few trivial randomness related APIs, with minimal Python overlap</a>.</span>
