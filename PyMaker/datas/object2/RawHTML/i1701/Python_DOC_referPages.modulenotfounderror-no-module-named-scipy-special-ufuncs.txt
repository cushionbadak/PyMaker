<p>I already installed scipy on Python3.6:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python3-scipy
pip3 install scipy
</code></pre>
<p>But, it does not work with this error.:</p>
<pre><code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'scipy.special._ufuncs'

<p>How can I do?</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your help.</p>

<p>In general, don't use <code>sudo pip</code>. 
Best use a virtualenv, and install everything into it.
What you see is a sign of a broken install, best reinstall from scratch --- or activate a virtualenv.</p>

<p>The <code>ufuncs</code> (aka <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/ufuncs.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Universal Functions</a>) is part of the <a href="http://www.numpy.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">NumPy</a> framework. When working with SciPy, it is necessary to install NumPy first as it's a dependency. You are getting this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ModuleNotFoundError" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ModuleNotFoundError</a> is likely due to the unavailability of NumPy package.</p>
<p>Before you try anything, list the currently installed packages:</p>
<p><code>pip3 list</code></p>
<p>If NumPy isn't installed then try installing it:</p>
<p><code>pip3 install numpy</code></p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>It seems that you had tried install scipy using ubuntu package installer. That's why your scipy version is 0.17. Sometimes it is possible that some ubuntu packages are outdated. Therefore, it's better to use the official package managers, like <a href="https://pypi.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PyPI</a> in case of Python.</p>
<p>First uninstall the scipy installed by the package manager:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get purge python3-scipy</code></p>
<p>When uninstalled successfully, reinstall it using PyPI:</p>
<p><code>pip3 install scipy</code></p>
<p>This will install the latest version (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/scipy/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">1.1.0</a>) from python package index.</p>
<p>If all goes well, you should be able to run your code without any errors.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I used pip3 list. Numpy 1.15.1 is already installed. And I attempted <code>pip3 install --upgrade scipy</code>  But, this phrase appears.  <b>Collecting scipy   Using cached <a href="https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a8/0b/f163da98d3a01b3e0ef1cab8dd2123c34aee2bafbb1c5bffa354cc8a1730/scipy-1.1.0-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl" rel="nofollow noreferrer">files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a8/0b/â€¦</a> Requirement already satisfied, skipping upgrade: numpy&gt;=1.8.2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages (from scipy) (1.15.1) Installing collected packages: scipy   Found existing installation: scipy 0.17.0</b></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><b>Cannot uninstall 'scipy'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall. You are using pip version 18.0, however version 18.1 is available. You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.</b></span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is probably a pip issue. Try reinstalling scipy instead, using <code>pip3 install --ignore-installed scipy</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also your scipy installation is too old, and I see where it is coming from. I'll edit the answer to incorporate the changes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The comment about ufuncs is wrong, sorry. The message is about a part of scipy.special package, which also ships several ufuncs.</span>
