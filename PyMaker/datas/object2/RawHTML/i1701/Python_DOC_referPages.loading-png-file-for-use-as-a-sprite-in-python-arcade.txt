<p>I am trying to create a Player class in Python Arcade wherein I use a .png image of a rectangle to create a sprite which the user moves in order to hit a ball. However, whenever I run the program, I receive a "FileNotFoundError". The file name is Red_Rectangle.png and it is currently located on my desktop. Below is an excerpt of the code that I am using. The error is triggered in the line containing "Red_Rectangle.png".</p>
<pre><code>def MyGame(arcade.Window):

    def __init__(self, width, height):
        super().__init__(width, height)
        self.player_list = None
        self.player_sprite = None
        self.score = 0

        arcade.set_background_color(arcade.color.BLACK)

    def setup(self):
        self.player_list = arcade.SpriteList()

        self.score = 0
        self.player_sprite = Player("Red_Rectangle.png", SPRITE_SCALING)
        self.player_sprite.center_x = 50
        self.player_sprite.center_y = 50
        self.player_list.append(self.player_sprite)

<p>It is because if you do a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.listdir</code></a> it will not return that the image is there, when Player method would want 'E:/somedir/Red_Rectangle.png' because the file does not exist in the current directory.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.path.join</code></a> to prepend the directory to your filename:</p>
<pre><code>import os
path = r'E:/somedir'

        super().__init__(width, height)

        self.player_sprite = None
        self.score =0
        arcade.set_background_color (arcade.color.BLACK)

    def setup(self):
        self.player_list = arcade.SpriteList()

        self.player_sprite.center_y = 50

<p>Or simply place the image file in the working directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>From information you have given, it seem file is not found, because it is not in working directory. </p>
<p>If you want to load image file from desktop, you need to specify path to desktop:</p>
<pre><code>import os

...

self.player_sprite = Player(os.path.expanduser("~/Desktop/Red_Rectangle.png"), SPRITE_SCALING)
</code></pre>
<p>Or move image file to your working directory.</p>
