<p>I have successfully converted .py file to .exe file using py2exe. 
I can successfully run the .py file,if i run it standalone.However, when iam trying to run the .exe file, it throws an error as seen in attached image.</p>
<p>In my .py file, i have the below import statements:</p>
<pre><code>import xlrd,xlwt,xlutils.copy,re,time,openpyxl,os
from openpyxl.styles import Alignment
from openpyxl import load_workbook
</code></pre>
<p>I have also accordingly tweaked setup.py file to include these packages as below setup.py code shows</p>
<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe

setup(
    console=['vu_t2.py'],
    options = {
        'py2exe': {
            'packages': ['xlrd','xlwt','xlutils','openpyxl','openpyxl.workbook']
        }
    }
)

<pre><code>python setup.py py2exe

<span class="comment-copy">First of all delete all *.pyc and check the line 475 in your vu_t2.py file if there is any error there. Then try to rebuild your .exe file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">vu_t2.py woks successfully without any error.I get error only when running the exe file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well i cannot help you a lot with only those informations. But i recommend you to look again in your setup.py and read this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I did not understand...what do you mean to say?Request you to kindly clarify</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You are trying to package and distribute openpyxl as an executable Windows file. This is not supported.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there an alternative by which i can make my executable work?</span>
