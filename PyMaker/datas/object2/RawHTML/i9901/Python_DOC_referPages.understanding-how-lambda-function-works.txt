<p>Help me understand Lambda functions, I checked a lot of codes but I still can't manage to understand it. Maybe with a simple example, thanks in advance.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Suppose you want to square in value in a list , foo = [1,2,3,4,5]</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(a)):
    a[i] = a[i] * a[i] 
</code></pre>
<p>You could use lambda and write </p>
<pre><code>map(lambda x: x * x, foo)
</code></pre>
<p>if you want only elements divisible by 3, then </p>
<pre><code>filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, foo)
</code></pre>
<p>Basically it save you from writing a for loop or to put it better write it in an efficient way.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you I guess</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Short version: Lambdas are anonymous functions (they don't have a name like normal functions). Often used to create callbacks or to be passed into other function calls</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oh, I see now, by the way, the part "x:" does it mean something like for loop?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BlueMonday That lambda is exactly equivalent to <code>def some_function(x): return x * x</code>. Notice that <code>x</code> is a parameter and <code>x * x</code> is an expression using that parameter. All that happened here is that the code saved a little space by not defining a separate function. Its useful because it moves the interesting part (<code>x * x</code>) nearer to its use (the map).</span>
