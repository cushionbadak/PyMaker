<p>I have three classes that receive input in similar ways, but each class takes a different number of arguments. So, class 1 has 7 arguments in its init function, class 2 has 4, and class 3 has 5, and I'd like to make a function that can initialize any one of them. How should I go about doing this? Normally I would take the list of parameters, p[0], p[1], etc., and feed them in as arguments to the class, but with an uncertain amount of input, I'm not sure how I can do this.</p>

<p>Without judging your design concepts, I reckon a plausible way to achieve this is by writing a function with a variable number of <code>args</code> and checking against their length, i.e:</p>
<pre><code>def initializer(*args):
    num_args = len(args)
    if num_args == 7:
        return Class1(*args)
    elif num_args == 5:
        return Class3(*args)
    elif num_args == 4:
        return Class2(*args)
    else:
        # handle this unsupported scenario
</code></pre>
<p>Handling error cases accordingly. </p>
<p>With some sample classes:</p>
<pre><code>class Class3:
    def __init__(self, a, b, c, d, e):
        print(a, b, c, d, e)

class Class2:
    def __init__(self, a, b, c, d):
        print(a, b, c, d)

class Class1:
    def __init__(self, a, b, c, d, e, f, g):
        print(a, b, c, d, e, f, g)
</code></pre>
<p>you'd get the required effect:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; initializer(1, 2, 3, 4)
1 2 3 4
&lt;__main__.Class2 at 0x7fe8e450ed68&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; initializer(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
1 2 3 4 5
&lt;__main__.Class3 at 0x7fe8e450ee80&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; initializer(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
&lt;__main__.Class1 at 0x7fe8e450e518&gt;
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Any code examples what you have and try to achieve?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The usual way would be to use <code>*args</code>. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Arbitrary Argument Lists</a> in the tutorial. Without seeing some sample code it's hard to be more specific.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Excellent, thank you! I'm still learning and had not heard of *args, this solves my problem perfectly.</span>
