<p>I am trying to use arrayFire python (<a href="https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-python</a>) for multi-GPU programming.  </p>
<p>However, when I try to interface it with the concurrent futures (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html</a>) library, I run into synchronization issues. </p>
<p>Does anyone have inputs on how to use arrayfire-python to parallel process on multiple GPUs ? </p>

<p>ArrayFire allows Mutli-GPU programming but does not distribute the work load automatically. It is up to the user to decide which memory and functions run on which device.</p>
<p>ArrayFire as it stands now is NOT thread safe. Hence running anything on multiple threads can cause issues.</p>
<p>Disclosure: I am a developer for ArrayFire.</p>
