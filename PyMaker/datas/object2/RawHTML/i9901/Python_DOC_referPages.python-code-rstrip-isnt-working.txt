<p>I've searched answers on here and tried implementing them but I think that there is some tiny detail I'm missing. I have a very short python code for a program that is supposed to return the initials with periods of a persons input(for their full name). So for example, input is Atticus Leonard Beasley and output should be </p>
<pre><code>A.L.B.
</code></pre>
<p>but instead I'm getting:</p>
<pre><code>A.
L.
B.
</code></pre>
<p>Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>def main():

    full_name = input("Enter your first, middle, and last name: ")

    for ch in full_name:
        if ch.isupper():
            ch = ch.rstrip('\n')
            print (ch,'.', sep='')

main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>FYI, you can do this using <code>split</code> and <code>join</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def main():

    full_name = input("Enter your first, middle, and last name: ")
    initials = []

    for name in full_name.split():
        initials.append(name[0])

    print('.'.join(initials) + '.')

main()
</code></pre>
<p>Or using list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>def main():

    full_name = input("Enter your first, middle, and last name: ")
    print('.'.join(name[0] for name in full_name.split())+'.')

main()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think you can do that in a easier and "more pythonic" way.</p>
<pre><code>full_name = input("Enter your first, middle, and last name: ")

print(''.join([ch[0].upper() + '.' for ch in full_name.split()]))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EXPLANATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Instead of doing a <code>for</code> loop over each letters of the name, you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">split()</a> function to be sure to took care of every words without the extra spaces.</p>
<pre><code>sentence = "hello world"

for ch in sentence.split():
    print(ch) # hello
    break
</code></pre>
<p>Now, you try to verify if the first letter is an <code>uppercase</code>, but if the user enter his name without <code>uppercase</code>, your function does not work. An easier solution will be to extract the first letter of the word <code>ch[0]</code> and automatically add an <code>uppercase</code>: <code>ch[0].upper()</code></p>
<p>Maybe the one-liner solution is confusing, but most of the python developers use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list comprehension</code></a>  over <code>for</code> loops when the solution is easily readable.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>One more thing, even if you are writing a simple function such as print the initials of a name, you should <em>always</em> write tests accordingly.</p>
<p>A good way to start is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/doctest.html#module-doctest" rel="nofollow noreferrer">doctests</a> because it forces you to describe what your function does. Even if you think it's a waste of times, it helps to overcome many problems when your program is getting bigger. I'd be please to help you if you want to try to write your first <code>doctest</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">If <code>ch</code> is <code>'A'</code>, what are you expecting <code>'A'.strip('\n')</code> to be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>for ch in full_name</code> should never have a <code>\n</code> as <code>ch</code> as the <code>input</code> takes all input up to the newline</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think you're over-complicating things. These are the steps you need: split the input using <code>split</code>, use indexing to get the first character of each word, use <code>'.'.join</code> to join these together</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <code>end=''</code> in your <code>print</code> call.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you Mark Dickinson, that worked exactly how I needed it to!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You forgot to add <code>.split()</code> function to full_name in the list comprehension example.</span>
