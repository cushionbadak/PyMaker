<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a csv file of service price list where column a = name of service and column b = has price.</p>
<p>I need to make a function like def pricelist("servicepricelist.csv", "servicename") -- the first part states the file, the second part is asking to pull an element in the row of the file like "washing".</p>
<p>I need to somehow, make the washing or whatever service is entered match the csv file column a and then print the value from column b</p>
<p>the output has to be like: </p>
<p>49.95 </p>
<p>Please help</p>

<p>Although I have not tested it, the following script should accomplish what you're looking for: </p>
<pre><code>import csv


def price_list(path: str, service: str) -&gt; str:
    value = None
    with open(path, newline='') as file:
        for name, price in csv.reader(file):
            if name == service:
                value = price
                break
    return value


if __name__ == '__main__':
    path = input('Path to csv: ')
    service = input('Service name: ')
    print(price_list(path, service))
</code></pre>
<p>All it does is import the standard library's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code></a> module, open the file, iterate over its contents until it finds the service, and print out the corresponding price.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is not a code-writing service.  You should do your own homework.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What are the delimiter and quote characters?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also, this has <i>nothing to do with the Spyder IDE</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@juanpa.arrivillaga this is an extra class I am taking. Not really homework. Kind of an exercise. The teacher is hasn't responded since last Wednesday.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Tankobot I don't know what that is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much!</span>
