<p>I'm trying to use the etsy API and I was finally able to get it running from the source.  I gave it my key, and it returned the following when printed out.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;etsy._v2.EtsyV2 object at 0xb7284ccc&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>However I have no idea what to do with it. The <a href="https://github.com/fulfilio/etsy-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github-repo</a> doesn't have much documentation, and the command that is suppose to follow doesn't work. I read the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation/getting_started/api_basics" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Etsy API</a> and didn't find the mentioned command <code>getFrontFeaturedListings</code> like the github listed.</p>
<p>I've had this issue before with an HTTP response object and I was told to use response.content to check out more info on the object. It didn't work for this object so I'm wondering if there was a simple way to test any generic object, or at least see what this object contains? </p>

<p>When in doubt you can always use the dir built-in method on an arbitrary python object. This will show you methods and fields attached to the object. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir</a></p>
<p>Anyway, sorry to hear about the poor documentation of the library. Last time I used Etsy's API I just created a little class that used requests. It wasn't much work since Etsy lays out all of the URIs + documentation nicely on their developer site. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation/reference/favoritelisting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation/reference/favoritelisting</a></p>
