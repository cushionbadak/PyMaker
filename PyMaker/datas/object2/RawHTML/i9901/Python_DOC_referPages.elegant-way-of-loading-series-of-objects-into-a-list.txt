<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a need to iterate over bunch of objects(30+ Objects are for 30+ buttons). Therefore I have a list looks like this,</p>
<pre><code>myObjList = [my.obj.obj1, my.obj.obj2, my.obj.obj3, ....... ]
</code></pre>
<p>What would be the most elegant way to load a list with these objects? </p>
</div>

<p>Since you're looking for flexible dot access, you're probably best off with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#getattr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>getattr</code></a> in a list comprehension:</p>
<pre><code>myObjList = [getattr(my.obj, 'obj'+str(i)) for i in range(n)]
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>n</code> is the number of <code>obj&lt;i&gt;</code> you need to get from <code>my.obj</code>.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Why doesn't <code>my.obj</code> have a list attribute, instead of loads of numbered attributes? How do you even create this to begin with?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't create these objects, they are presented to me. I'm in automated testing. I just want to exercise 30+ buttons using these objects....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then I'd suggest to whoever <i>does</i> write the code that there is a way that could do that better <i>and</i> make your life easier.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't create these objects, they are presented to me. I'm in automated testing. I just want to exercise 30+ buttons using these objects. I hope that clears up the comment about the design. Nevertheless, thank you very much for help!</span>
