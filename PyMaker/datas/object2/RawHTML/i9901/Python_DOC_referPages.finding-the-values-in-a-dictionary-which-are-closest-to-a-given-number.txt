<p>New to python 3 and trying to play about with some dictionaries.</p>
<p>What I'm going for is I have a dictionary with a lot of keys e.g. <code>{Dog : 2, Cat : 5, Fish : 3}</code> but its really big. Now I'm given a value e.g. <code>2</code> and I want it to return ten dictionary elements have have the value closest to <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>Any ideas if it is possible to do this, and if so can some one point me on the right path?</p>
<p>Sorry I have just realised that actually all I want to be returned is the key.</p>

<p>Yes.  With Python, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html#heapq.nsmallest" rel="nofollow noreferrer">heapq.nsmallest</a></p>
<pre><code>import heapq
d = &lt;iterable of many key-value pairs&gt;

def f(pair): return abs(pair[1]-2)

least10 = heapq(10, d, key=f)
</code></pre>
<p>For more general answers, search web for 'n smallest'.  There are related answers already on SO.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Closest as in 2 and 3 or some more scientific approach like <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">nearest neighbors</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is the value always a number?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so if in my dictionary there were <code>5</code> elements with value <code>2</code>, <code>1</code> element with value <code>3</code>, <code>4</code> with value <code>1</code>, <code>6</code> with value <code>0</code>, <code>9</code> with value <code>4</code>. Then it would return the elements with values <code>2</code>,<code>1</code> and <code>3</code>. The value is always a number in this dictionary</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I always like it when I see a core-dev come around and answer. :-) This is better than iterating but it might not be as intuitive for the OP (As a beginner).</span>
