<p>Is there a way I be able to put <code>daemon_thread</code> to sleep for example for 3 seconds from outside of <code>do_something()</code>? I mean something hypothetical like <code>daemon_thread.sleep(3)</code>?</p>

<p>Create a counter for half seconds and then make the sleep function increment that counter:</p>
<pre><code>lock = Lock()
counter = 0


def do_something():
    global counter
    while True:
        time.sleep(0.5)
        with lock:
            if counter == 0:
                print('I am alive')
            else:
                counter -= 1


def increment(seconds):
    global counter
    with lock:
        counter += 2*seconds


# after starting thread

increment(3)  # make the thread wait three seconds before continuing

<span class="comment-copy">@LutzHorn Maybe it's early morning effect, but I remember you once had a different SO account.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see. Yes, I had other accounts before. But the very low quality of questions and the wast of time SO is made me delete them ;) Let's see how long I can stand the ignorance of people trying to program this time.</span>
