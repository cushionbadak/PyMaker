<p>I am trying to figure out how to use a barely documented feature of a poorly documented API. I have distilled the chunk of code that is giving me trouble down to this for simplicity:</p>
<pre><code>def build_custom_args(args):
    custom_args = {}
        for key in args:
            custom_args.update(key.get())
        print(custom_args)
</code></pre>
<p>I can tell from the function that constructs <code>args</code> that it is a list. Problem is, a list of <em>what?</em> No matter what I put in the list, key.get() raises one exception of another.</p>
<p>For example, if I execute that code like so: <code>build_custom_args(['foo'])</code> then I get an understandable error message: <code>AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'</code>.</p>
<p>Or, try a dictionary: <code>build_custom_args([{'foo': 'bar'}])</code>, but the error is raised: <code>TypeError: get expected at least 1 arguments, got 0</code>.</p>
<p>As best I can tell <code>args</code> is a list of some standard python objects - there is no indication that these are special objects with a custom <code>get()</code> method.</p>
<p>Am I missing something obvious? Is there some standard python object that has a <code>get()</code> method which takes no positional arguments? Is this a syntax of some older version of Python? Or have I found a bug in the API?</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>
The accepted answer shows that I was mistaken believing that <code>args</code> had to be a python built-in.</p>
<p>Jack's answer is worth a look because it actually does solve the problem "what Python built-in could <code>args</code> be that would cause this function to not throw an error?"</p>

<p>Well... I found this in the github link you have provided </p>
<pre><code>class Email(object):
    # code... 

    def get(self):
</code></pre>
<p>Matter of fact, a lot of those classes have get methods. </p>
<p>Since Python is duck typed, there isn't really a way to determine what object is correct, but you're just building a dictionary, so shouldn't matter too much </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>AFAIK the only class with a <code>get</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html?highlight=get#queue.Queue.get" rel="nofollow noreferrer">method that can take zero arguments</a> is a <code>Queue</code>.</p>
<p>Which in your example is probably a <code>Queue</code> of <code>dict</code>s</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Python is duck typed, so there could be more than one type that implements a <code>.get</code>, talk less custom classes. You could start by telling what exactly the function is supposed to do, with the args</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are there any standard python types that have a <code>.get</code> method which takes no positional arguments?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is this a Tkinter-based application, by any chance?  StringVar, IntVar, etc. have a zero-arg <code>get()</code> method.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suppose there is no need for me to be cryptic about the API I'm looking at, I just wanted the answer to be more generally applicable than very specific. The API I am looking at is <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python</a>. To answer your question specifically, no searching the repo for tkinter I don't see anything. The specific file I'm working on is <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/blob/master/sendgrid/helpers/mail/mail.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/blob/master/sendgrid/â€¦</a> at about line 70</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You have a <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/blob/master/sendgrid/helpers/mail/mail.py#L213" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Header</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-python/blob/master/sendgrid/helpers/mail/mail.py#L267" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>CustomArg</code></a> instance.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And I found this: class <code>CustomArg(object): ... return custom_arg</code>. I got so caught up thinking the custom_arg was a standard python type that when searches for custom_arg didn't turn anything up, I got completely side tracked going down this rabbit hole. Thanks, this clearly lead me to the right answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">However, <code>Queue</code> is not a built-in, so OP should check the imports to see if <code>queue</code> module is imported.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>Queue</code> is part of Python, but you only need to import if you're creating a new <code>Queue</code>. The way the method is in the question would NOT require it to be imported in that file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That said, I agree doing a grep for <code>queue</code> or <code>Queue</code> in the full project would almost certainly lead to if this is the correct answer or not...although if the method just <i>expects</i> a <code>Queue</code> it would not require an import anywhere else.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, I did not mean "the imports of the file", but "the imports in the whole project".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Jack is certainly right, and +1 for actually answering the question that I asked and not digging into github to answer the question that I needed answering.</span>
