<p>After trying many different methods for this problem, such as nested <code>for</code> loops (which iterate over the first list as many times as the length of the second iteration), and I've tried <code>.join</code> which I couldn't get to do what I wanted.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Here is the problem...</strong> </p>
<p>I am using two <code>for</code> loops to append the same list. </p>
<p>The first <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>for friend in individual_friends:
    friends.append(friend.text)
</code></pre>
<p>Which gives me:</p>
<pre><code>['Jody Ann Elizabeth Lill\n98 mutual friends\nFriends',
 ...., 
'Jayde Woods\n56 mutual friends\n4 new posts\nFriends']
</code></pre>
<p>the second <code>for</code> loop:</p>
<pre><code>for link in individual_friends_links:
    links = link.get_attribute("href")
    friends.append(links)
</code></pre>
<p>Which gives me:</p>
<pre><code>['Jody Ann Elizabeth Lill\n98 mutual friends\nFriends', 
..., '
Jayde Woods\n56 mutual friends\n4 new posts\nFriends', 
'https://m.facebook.com/jodyannelizabeth.lill?ref=bookmarks', 
..., 
'https://m.facebook.com/jayde.woods?ref=bookmarks']
</code></pre>
<p>What I actually want is:</p>
<pre><code>['Jody Ann Elizabeth Lill\n98 mutual friends\nFriends\nhttps://m.facebook.com/jodyannelizabeth.lill?ref=bookmarks', 
..., 
'Jayde Woods\n56 mutual friends\n4 new posts\nFriends\nhttps://m.facebook.com/jayde.woods?ref=bookmarks']
</code></pre>

<h1>The Error</h1>
<p>The mistake you are making is that, by calling <code>append</code>, you are always adding to the <em>end</em> of <code>friends</code>. </p>
<p>But for your links, you don't want to add to the end of <code>friends</code>, you want to change the value of an element already in <code>friends</code>.</p>
<h1>The Solution</h1>
<p>You need something more like this:</p>
<pre><code># create your list of friends
for friend in individual_friends:
    friends.append(friend.text)

# for every *i*th link, look up the *i*th friend in `friends`,
# and modify that value, instead of adding to the end of `friends`.
for link_index, link in enumerate(individual_friend_links):
    friends[link_index] = friends[link_index] + '\n' + link.get_attribute("href")
</code></pre>
<h1>The Better Solution</h1>
<p>But this is verbose. There is no need to do two explicit <code>for</code>-loops. You need the power of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zip</code></a>, which will merge your two separate lists into a single list of 2-tuples and do exactly the same as the above. </p>
<pre><code>for friend, link in zip(individual_friends, individual_friends_links):
    friends.append(friend.text + '\n' + link.get_attribute("href")) 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hey Akshat thank you, your answer is soooo close but I had to fix a couple of things, maybe you were not to foresee one of them, firstly <code>friend</code> is a WebElement which we cannot concatenate with a string, so we needed to add the <code>.text</code> to <code>friend</code> when appending. Secondly you missed out adding the <code>\n</code> in the concatenation, please edit your answer for me to mark as the correct answer...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I added the newline character, and added the <code>.text</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">great edit to your answer Akshat, you have made it very clear, I still feel you should include the <code>.text</code> part and the <code>\n</code> part as others may have a similar problem and without basic knowledge of the mechanics. But anyway great answer and thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JackHerer I just did.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Cool, I  thought Iwould maybe do  aproper suggested edit instead, I will mark as answered as this is working great, thanks again.</span>
