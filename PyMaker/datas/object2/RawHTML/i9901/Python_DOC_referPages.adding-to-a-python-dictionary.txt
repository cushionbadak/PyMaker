<p>I'm trying to count the frequency of occurrences of a particular symbol in a given string and create a dictionary out of this. For some reason, the function just returns an empty dictionary. I think the problem arises with adding a new value to the dictionary, but not sure how to troubleshoot it/fix it.  </p>
<pre><code>input: countFrequency('MISSISSIPPI')
output: {}
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Do this:</p>
<pre><code>def countFrequency(L):
    fdict = {}
    for x in range(0, len(L)):
        if str(L[x]) in fdict.keys():
           fdict[str(L[x])] = fdict[str(L[x])] + 1
        else:
           fdict[str(L[x])] = 1
    return fdict         
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The code in the inner loop:</p>
<pre><code>        if L[x] == fdict[str(x)]:
            value = value + 1
        else:
            fdict[L[x]] = 1
</code></pre>
<p>is unreachable, because the dictionary is empty initally, and hence you will never add any value to <code>fdict</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can do it likes this:</p>
<pre><code>def countFrequency(L):
    fdict = {}
    for symbol in L: #gets each letter in l
        if symbol in fdict: #check if dhe dictionary already has an value for the symbol
            fdict[symbol] += 1
        else:
            fdict[symbol] = 1
    return fdic
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Another issue is that the value <code>value</code> is never assigned to anything or used, so even if we were to go through the loop we would never increment a value in the dictionary.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>for key, value in fdict:</code> your dict is empty. Also why do you think you need a for loop to add elements to a dict?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm checking to see if that letter is already in the dictionary, and if so, I would just add one to the value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you're not writing this for homework, I'd strongly recommend using <code>collections.Counter</code> rather than writing your own code to do the same thing. Python comes with batteries included! Your whole function body could be <code>return collections.Counter(L)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, but that doesn't explain the <code>for</code> loop. You aren't even using <code>key</code> (and the way you are trying to use <code>value</code> is wrong logically)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could avoid all this by using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>collections.Counter()</code> class</a>.</span>
