<p>We all know that if we want to find the last number of  1182973981273983 which is 3 we simply do this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(1182973981273983 % 10)
3
</code></pre>
<p>But if I want to get the last number of 2387123.23 I was thinking of doing this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2387123.23 % 10 ** (-1 * 2)
0.009999999931681564
</code></pre>
<p>But it doesn't work. What is the mathematical way of getting the last number a decimal number.</p>
<p>p.s. String solutions are invalid. We are programmers we need to know how math works.</p>

<p>As people have already pointed out in the comments, this is not possible for floating point numbers; the concept of 'last decimal' simply doesn't apply. See links in comments for more details.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this would work if you were using fixed point arithmetic (i.e. the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Decimal</code></a> type). Then a solution might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import decimal
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = decimal.Decimal('3.14')
&gt;&gt;&gt; d.as_tuple().digits[-1]
4
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">To do rounding you use strings or BigDecimals floats will worek as you see they are well defined but not useful for rounding see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/588004/is-floating-point-math-broken" title="is floating point math broken">stackoverflow.com/questions/588004/â€¦</a> and for your last comment [What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic](What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>3</code> isn't the last decimal, it's just formatted to look that way.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">String solutions are valid because string formatting understands maths. If you mean you want to understand precision errors in floating point representations then that's something different.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want the nth decimal place, it's probably easiest to multiply the number by <code>10 ** n</code> and use <code>% 10</code> again. If you want a purely numerical solution, that's not really a programming question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not all floats can be represented in machine based form (binary) without losing precision. So, the question, "Give me the last decimal digit of a given number" becomes ill-formed while using built-in types in Python (unless you work with strings). To work with arbitrary precision, you can use 3rd party libraries.</span>
