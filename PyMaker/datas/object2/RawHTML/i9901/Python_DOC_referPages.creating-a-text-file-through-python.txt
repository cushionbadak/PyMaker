<p>I am trying to make my program locate a flower within a text file. The file tells the user how many flowers of that type are in stock. I can make it do this by printing the information, but is there any way the computer can put the information into a new text file first and then print the text file?</p>
<p>Here is the text file which contains the flowers and their stock level (and some other numbers to do with how many need to be in stock)</p>
<pre><code>cacti,  7,  10,  5
roses,  15,  20,  20
tulips,  4,  10,  5
lilies,  9,  15,  7
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the program I have so far, which only prints what i need to find instead of making a new text file:</p>
<pre><code>stockfile=open("stockfile.txt", "r")

print("Flower Shop") 
print("cacti, roses, tulips, or lilies?") 
flower=input("Which type of flower do you need to know the stock level of?")    
line=stockfile.readline() 
data=line.split(",") 
if flower == "cacti":
    print("Cacti" , data[0])
    print("Cacti in stock: ", data[1])
    print("Target stock level", data[2])
    print("Reorder level", data[3])
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A quick comment to get you started: .write() is the method for writing to file. And when opening a file, do it in a context to keep everything clean. example:</p>
<pre><code>with open("outfile.txt","w") as fout:
    #do your stuff and write it out
    fout.write(&lt;data&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>For your case you can to everything in a loop, of course. For instance:</p>
<pre><code>with open("stockfile.txt","r") as fin:
    with open("outfile.txt","w") as fout:
        for line in fin:
            #do your stuff and write it out
            fout.write(&lt;data&gt;)
</code></pre>
<p>Best of luck.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can open a new file object as follows</p>
<pre><code>fileObject = open('newfile.txt', 'w')
</code></pre>
<p>Write the required result in to the file and print from there as you do for the first file.</p>
<pre><code>fileObject.write("Cacti : {}, In stock: {}, Target stock level: {}, Reorder level".format(data[0], data[1], data[2], data[3]))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Because you wrote it to <code>print</code> instead of writing to a text file. Why would you be surprised that that's what it does?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't <code>stockfile.write()</code> any where in your code - Hence why it isn't writing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Take a look, help yourself: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have wrote it to print but i just don't know how i would write it to a text file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Then have you considered doing some research on that? <i>"python write to file"</i> gets about 11.5 million hits on Google, have you tried reading a few of those?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>"a+"</code> means it appends to a file if it exists, and also opens for read as well. None of which is necessary for populating a new file from scratch (which should be mode <code>"w"</code>).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right. I added append mode in case the file had to be edited during next runs. Thank you.</span>
