<p>The magic command <code>%time</code> produces the time it takes to execute a given code segment (statement) to the output cell in Jupyter Notebook. I would like this to be appended on to a specified file instead.</p>
<p>My objective is to find the runtime of an algorithm in different settings. I am able to automate the parameters of the algorithm, although not able to store the output of the <code>%time</code> (and <code>%timeit</code>) magic command in a file for further processing.</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>

<p><code>%timeit</code> (but not <code>%time</code>) has a <code>-o</code> option which makes it return an object, so you can do:</p>
<pre><code>res = %timeit -o foo()
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can get the numbers from res and write them to a file however you wish.</p>
<p>For more flexibility, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">timeit module</a> in the standard library. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">@ThomasK That's nice. I'd be happier if you could post this comment as an answer.</span>
