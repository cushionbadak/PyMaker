<p>I have a list (original_List) that is made up of multiple strings with space in each element as below. How do I create a separate list of the last string (or only file name excluding everything else) of each element from the original list?</p>
<pre><code>Original_List = ['-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root   134801 Nov  2 14:27 aa_base-13.txt', 
'-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root 58630 Nov  2 14:27 aaa_base-extras.txt', 
'-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root   300664 Nov  2 14:27 aaa_base-extras.txt']
Expected output for th new list should be as below:
</code></pre>
<p>Extracted_list </p>
<pre><code>['aa_base-13.txt', 'aaa_base-extras.txt', 'aaa_base-extras.txt']
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That's how:</p>
<pre><code>new_list = [x.split()[-1] for x in Original_List]
</code></pre>
<p>Please include your attempts in the future when asking questions.</p>
<p>There is no argument passed to <code>split</code> as you can see and that means it takes the default which is the space. Then, the newly created sublists are <em>sliced</em> and just the last item is taken (that's what the <code>[-1]</code> is for). Try removing it to see what it produces.</p>
<p>Of course as most of the times in programming (if not always) there are many ways to do a task. Another for example would be this:</p>
<pre><code>new_list = [y for item in [x.split() for x in Original_List] for y in item if '.' in y]
</code></pre>
<p>With this second one you are looking for substrings that contain dots <code>'.'</code>. You could also replace that with <code>'.txt'</code>. That's a more solid way to look for filenames or filenames of a specific extension since they are bound to contain at least one dot.</p>
<p>What the two approaches have in common is that they are <strong>list comprehensions</strong>. This is a core concept in python and i would suggest looking at it if you are serious about this.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is tricky to do correctly if you need to handle file names that contain spaces. However, parsing the output of <code>ls</code> is generally discouraged. Can't you use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>listdir</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>scandir</code></a> instead?</span>
