<p>I've gotten use to using print in my python code to show contents of variable and checking the shell output.
But i have now migrated all my work onto a online server. Pythonanywhere </p>
<p>I don't have the foggiest idea how to do the same now?
Can someone point me in the right direction?
Print to web console? To a file? Or even to the shell session?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>On production server your print statements will output log to your webserver log files
In case of pythonanywhere there are three log files</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Access log:yourusername.pythonanywhere.com.access.log<br/>
  Error log:yourusername.pythonanywhere.com.error.log<br/>
  Server log:yourusername.pythonanywhere.com.server.log</p>
</blockquote>
<p>those logs are accessible in your web tab page.</p>
<p>The logs you are looking for will be in server.log</p>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40560572/296460">Serjik's answer</a> you can see the output of the console via the server log link on PythonAnywhere.</p>
<p>However the much better way to approach this is to use the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">logging module.</a>. Using this module will solve many of these problems for you and solve many issues you may not have thought about (like thread safety). This lets you do things like filter log messages by severity and a whole bunch of other things.</p>
<p>To get started with that I would recommend having a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial" rel="nofollow noreferrer">basic logging tutorial</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">print statement will output to the web server out log, on pythonanywhere access to web tag, there are three logs there Access log:username.pythonanywhere.com.access.log Error log:username.pythonanywhere.com.error.log Server log:username.pythonanywhere.com.server.log</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Serjik please write a real answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">also if you print to sys.stderr then it will show up in the error log (which may be less cluttered vs printing to stdout to the server log)</span>
