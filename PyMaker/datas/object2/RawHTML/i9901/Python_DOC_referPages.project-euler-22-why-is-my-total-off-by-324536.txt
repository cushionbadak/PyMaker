<p>I'm trying to do problem #22 in python and my answer is off. I've gone through the list and tried certain names and they've been calculated correctly (I think). </p>
<p>Can anyone help??</p>
<h1>Problem:</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text
  file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it
  into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for
  each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the
  list to obtain a name score.</p>
<p>For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
  which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the
  list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the total of all the name scores in the file?</p>
<pre><code>def letter_sum(word):
    total = 0
    for letter in word:
        total += ord(letter) - ord('A') + 1
    return total

def namescore(name, count):
    name_sum = letter_sum(name)
    return count * name_sum

def main():
    names = []
    f = open('p022_names.txt', 'r')
    string = f.read()
    f.close()

    total = 0
    names = sorted(string.replace('"', '').split(','))
    for i in range(len(names)):
        total += namescore(names[i], i)

    print total
</code></pre>

<p>Your indexing is off by one. <code>'COLIN'</code> is at index <code>937</code> on <code>0</code> based indexing but the assignment uses <code>1</code> based indexing. You could fix the issue by changing your code a bit:</p>
<pre><code>total += namescore(names[i], i + 1)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's off-by-one error. In the code:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(len(names)):
    total += namescore(names[i], i)
</code></pre>
<p><code>i</code> starts from <code>0</code>, while the name should start counting from <code>1</code>, use <code>namescore(names[i], i + 1)</code> instead.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Mind briefly telling us again what #22 is about without each of us having to go look it up individually?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">edited - thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're multiplying by <code>i</code> when calling <code>namescore</code>, which starts from 0. I think that is the issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In your list of sorted names, after the split(","), "COLIN" in your list is in 939th place, not in 938th. The Euler challenge says it should be at position 938.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As an aside, you might find <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>enumerate</code></a> useful for looping through lists like this: <code>for i, name in enumerate(names, start=1): total += namescore(name, i)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oops. had a different mistake before where 'COLIN' was at 938 and i must've not checked after i corrected it.   thank you!!</span>
