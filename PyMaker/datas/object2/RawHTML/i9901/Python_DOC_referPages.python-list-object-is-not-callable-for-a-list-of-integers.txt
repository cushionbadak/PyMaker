<p>I always get the Error: 'List' object not callable... I looked around in Google and tried every given solution, but it's still the same.
I cannot get my code to work. I have a list of integers, and I need to give every element to different variables. </p>
<pre><code>dmy = input('What is your date? Please put in like this: 2.11.2016')
dmy.strip(".")
dmy = [int(x) for x in dmy.split('.')]
list(dmy)
print(dmy)

dd = dmy(0)
mm = dmy(1)
yy = dmy(2)
</code></pre>
<p>The first part of the code is working. I get the error while trying to give the list element to another variable so this dmy(0) does not work. But it is in all the books I have this way? </p>
<p>I use python 3.5.2</p>

<p>I see what you are trying to do. An element in the list is obtained by <code>list[index]</code> format. While you are trying to call as <code>list(index)</code> which python is interpreting as function call and hence throwing you error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: 'list' object is not callable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Corrected code:</p>
<pre><code>dmy = input('What is your date? Please put in like this: 2.11.2016')
dmy.strip(".")
dmy = [int(x) for x in dmy.split('.')]
list(dmy)
print(dmy)

dd = dmy[0]
mm = dmy[1]
yy = dmy[2]
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dd = dmy[0]
&gt;&gt;&gt; mm = dmy[1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; yy = dmy[2]

<span class="comment-copy">Are you aware of difference between <code>something(1)</code> and <code>something[1]</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">a) Your <code>list(dmy)</code> is not doing anything because it always creates a new object, and you haven't assigned that new object anywhere - so Python will always discard it. And b) you want to do <code>dmy[0], dmy[1],...</code>, not <code>dmy(0), dmy(1)...</code>. The first is a function call, the latter is how you actually do list lookup. <code>dmy</code> is not a function so you should never have expected <code>dmy(0)</code> to work.
