<p>I'm learning python 3 and am trying to learn classes. This code is giving me trouble. It's supposed to be for an very basic virtual pet:</p>
<pre><code>class Critter(object):
def __init__(self, name):
    print("I am born")
    self.name = name
def talk (self, speech):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>This is the start of the code, and seems to be error free. Then I have:</p>
<pre><code>crit1 = Critter(input("Choose a name for me "))
crit2 = Critter(input("Choose a name for me "))
crit1.talk(speech = input("Hello. I am ", self.name, ". What shall I say? ")
        print("\n", speech))
crit2.talk(speech = input("Hello. I am ", self.name, ". What shall I say? ")
        print("\n", speech,))
</code></pre>
<p>This gives an error:</p>
<pre><code>line 13
print("\n", speech))
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In addition to the other answer, also, your intendation seems to be faulty.
Try changing</p>
<pre><code>class Critter(object):
def __init__(self, name):
    print("I am born")
    self.name = name
def talk (self, speech):
    pass
</code></pre>
<p>into </p>
<pre><code>class Critter(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        print("I am born")
        self.name = name
    def talk (self, speech):
        pass
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you call <code>talk</code> here:</p>
<pre><code>crit1.talk(speech = input("Hello. I am ", self.name, ". What shall I say? ")
        print("\n", speech))
</code></pre>
<p>You open another parentheses with <code>input</code> as well. Because of this, Python thinks you're still trying to pass arguments to <code>talk</code>. When passing arguments, you can't just have a line break and then something else without closing it, thus the syntax error on that line.</p>
<p>I would recommend that you close your call like so:</p>
<pre><code>crit1.talk(speech = input("Hello. I am ", self.name, ". What shall I say? "))
</code></pre>
<p>And then have your print statement, without the extra parenthesis:</p>
<pre><code>print("\n", speech)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I think your intendation may be faulty. Remember intendation is very important in python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Also you need to count your parentheses in and out...</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here are the docs</a>. They'll be infinitely more helpful than we will be. Specifically, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-and-instance-variables" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this part</a> will be very helpful to you for usage.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think that, with the way that their code is set up, the parenthesis to close the <code>talk</code> method call, is actually that one that you're proposing they remove. They just need to move it to before the <code>print</code> statement. EDIT: ah nvm you got it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ElliotRoberts Oh, right. Correct you are.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Mind if I make an answer, or you wanna steal the glory? :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ElliotRoberts haha, go ahead. I will remove mine</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Haven't done much python, but <code>print("\n", speech,)</code> is that really a thing? I am thinking of the two commas <code>,</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nvm, seems to be a way of doing concatenations. Never seen comma <code>,</code> instead of plus <code>+</code> before</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Aidin <code>print</code> takes a variable number of positional arguments, think <code>*args</code> if you've seen it. It prints a new line followed by speech with a default separation of <code>' '</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">right you are, it doesn't break anything, the comma, but I've removed it 'cause it doesn't do anything</span>
