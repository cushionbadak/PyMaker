<p>The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>I have a .txt file with results of several nslookups.</p>
<p>I want to loop tru the file and everytime it hits the string "Non-authoritative answer:" the scripts has to print the following 8 lines <em>from</em> that position. If it works I shoud get all the positive results in my screen :).</p>
<p>First I had the following code:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/usr/python

file = open('/tmp/results_nslookup.txt', 'r')
f = file.readlines()

for positives in f:
        if 'Authoritative answers can be found from:' in positives:
                print positives
file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>But that only printed "Authoritative answers can be found from:" the times it was in the .txt.</p>
<p>The code what I have now:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/usr/python

file = open('/tmp/results_nslookup.txt', 'r')
lines = file.readlines()

i = lines.index('Non-authoritative answer:\n')

for line in lines[i-0:i+9]:
        print line,

file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>But when I run it, it prints the first result nicely to my screen but does not print the other positve results.</p>
<p>p.s. I am aware of socket.gethostbyname("foobar.baz") but first I want to solve this basic problem.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>You can use the file as an iterator, then print the next 8 lines every time you find your sentence:</p>
<pre><code>with open('/tmp/results_nslookup.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        if line == 'Non-authoritative answer:\n':
            for i in range(8):
                print(next(lines).strip())
</code></pre>
<p>Each time you use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#next" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>next()</code> function</a> on the file object (or loop over it in a <code>for</code> loop), it'll return the next line in that file, until you've read the last line.</p>
<p>Instead of the <code>range(8)</code> for loop, I'd actually use <code>itertools.islice</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import islice

with open('/tmp/results_nslookup.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        if line == 'Non-authoritative answer:\n':
            print(''.join(islice(f, 8)))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>file = open('/tmp/results_nslookup.txt', 'r')
for line in file:
    if line=='Non-authoritative answer:\n':
        for _ in range(8):
            print file.next()
</code></pre>
<p>By the way: don't ever use the name <code>file</code> for a variable because it is the name of a built-in function.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">This is what <code>grep</code> was made for, in particular the <code>-A</code> option: <code>grep -A8 'Non-authoritative answer:' /tmp/results_nslookup.txt</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or a simple <code>awk</code> one-liner: <code>awk 'count--&gt;0;/Non-authoritative answer:/{count=8;print}' /tmp/results_nslookup.txt</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kevin I think you should have made that an answer.  Of course, I have this rebellious streak for lateral answers...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the quick solution!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is there a Python 3 version to this solution?  Instead of printing I'm trying to get the results in 8 dataframe columns.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ArthurD.Howland: I've made the answer compatible with Python 2 and 3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for the tip!</span>
