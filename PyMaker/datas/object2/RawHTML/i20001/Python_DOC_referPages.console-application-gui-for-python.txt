<p>We have console application option in C#, but how do I can make a console GUI in python?
I should note I want to compile and use my program in windows.
Also I want to select Items in Python GUI by Enter button.</p>

<p>If you're using Windows you will ultimately need to integrate with the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681913(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="noreferrer">win32 console API</a> to create a console GUI (aka. a Text UI or TUI).  Your options are basically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write your TUI using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html" rel="noreferrer">curses</a> or the packages that sit on top of it, like urwid or npyscreen.  To do this you either need to install cygwin or PDcurses to make it work.</li>
<li>Write to the win32 API directly using something like pywin32.</li>
<li>Use a package that simplifies the win32 API like effbot's console package.</li>
</ol>
<p>I found all the above unsatisfactory as I didn't want all the hassle of installing 3rd party binaries for Windows and wanted an API that I could use anywhere (after a simple <code>pip</code> install), so I wrote a cross-platform package (<a href="https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics" rel="noreferrer">asciimatics</a>) to fix it.  This package takes all the hassle away and provides a clean, documented API with <a href="http://asciimatics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/widgets.html" rel="noreferrer">a set of widgets</a> for TUI applications.</p>
<p>For example the following is a screenshot of the contacts list sample code referenced in the previous docs link, showing some of the basic text and button widgets.</p>

<p>Take a look at Python's curses library:</p>

<p>If you'd like a Python shell, then you might want to look at something like PyFlakes / PyShell or similar.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Try a console UI library: <a href="http://excess.org/urwid/examples.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">excess.org/urwid/examples.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would suggest a screenshot of what asciimatics programs looks like. Not necessarily in your answer, but at least on your documentation page. It sounds cool but I would have like to have seen an example somewhere. (unless there is and I didn't find it?)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks.  I've yet to create a video for the <a href="https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics/wiki" rel="nofollow noreferrer">gallery</a> so have added a screenshot here for now instead...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, it's way cooler then I was picturing. Good job! It puts my terminal screensavers to shame.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I should note that I need console application GUI for user interface not for development. I am working on simple accounting program for a small business so I need a simple (similar to Dos) GUI for users.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Urwid (on <a href="http://excess.org/urwid/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">excess.org/urwid</a>) is a sample. But I don't know how use it on windows 7.</span>
