<p>I apologise for another simple question but I truly am stuck...I'm trying to add a .lower() method to convert any user input whether it be upper case, lower case or combo, into lower case. </p>
<p>I just can't figure out exactly where to add the .lower()?</p>
<p>This is the main function of the game:</p>
<pre><code>def main():

for turn in range(20, 0, -1):
    print("")
    describe()
    cmd = input("Enter your command " + str(turn) + "&gt; ")
    if cmd == "quit":
        print("You gave in so easily :-(")
        break
    elif cmd.startswith("go "):
        where = cmd[3:]
        move_cmd(where)
        if state == "dead":
            print("you are dead")
        elif state == "outside":
            print("You jimmy the door open with the crowbar and escape to your freedom!")
            break
    elif cmd.startswith("take "):
        obj_name = cmd[5:]
        take_cmd(obj_name)
    else:
        print("I do not understand '" + cmd + "'.  Try go/take/quit")
print("Game over")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre>
<p>So I think this is the line of code to add it too...but it doesn't work...</p>
<pre><code>cmd = input("Enter your command " + str(turn) + "&gt; ").lower() 
</code></pre>
<p>this doesn't work...do I need to add another loop or change the line of code somehow? </p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Any string is an instance of the str class. So you can use .lower(), .upper(), etc on any string. The type returned by input() is a str. So you want this, right above your if statements that begin by checking if the command is quit:
    cmd = cmd.lower()</p>
<p>You might want to check out python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">tutorial</a> or <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">standard library reference</a> so you can look at examples and see what the standard library and types (like str!) have to offer.</p>

<p>Solution: Instead of using <strong>"cmd = input("Enter your command " + str(turn) + "&gt; ")"</strong>, use below one:</p>
<pre><code>cmd = raw_input("Enter your command " + str(turn) + "&gt; ")
cmd = cmd.lower()
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong> of using <strong>raw_input() instead of input()</strong>:</p>
<p>1) input() is equivalent to eval(raw_input()), so it parses and evaluates your input as a valid Python expression.</p>
<p>2) eval() interprets a string as code. And if you write any command which it fails to parse, it gives error.   </p>

<p>You are trying to set the input lowercase.
You need to set the var "cmd" lowercase</p>
<pre><code>cmd = input("Enter your command " + str(turn) + "&gt; ")
cmd.lower()
...
if ...
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The line you added should have worked. Are you sure it doesn't? try printing <code>cmd</code> immediately after</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://repl.it/H5kC/1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">repl.it/H5kC/1</a> - it works fine. This is why the guides for how to ask a question on stackoverflow include saying what behaviour you expect it to do, and what behaviour it actually does - including any errors. When you say it "doesn't work", are you getting syntax errors, or uppercase text coming back, or what?</span>
