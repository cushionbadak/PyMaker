<p>I'm trying to dynamically add some data to a dictionary in python which I then convert to a json formatted string.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "Module": "lights",
  {
    "id": 1,
    "power": 50
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "power": 0
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "power": 25
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>the id and power need to be added dynamically how would I achieve this with python? How would I read the same json format as well?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>that's an invalid construct in both JSON and Python
it should be something like</p>
<pre><code>{
  "Module": "lights",
  "Values":[
      {
        "id": 1,
        "power": 50
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "power": 0
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "power": 25
      }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>grouping all the dicts {_id: ..., power: ...} in a list</p>
<p>taken care of that, converting from JSON to dict and vice-versa one could use the <code>load/loads</code> and <code>dump/dumps</code> methods from the <code>json</code> or <code>simplejson</code> packages</p>
