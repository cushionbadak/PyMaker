<p>How do you kill PDB and the program it's running, similar to LLDB's <code>proc kill; exit</code> or <code>exit (y)</code> commands?</p>
<p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> isn't working and all the questions I see on here are how to exit while keeping the program running. However, I'm sitting in a PDB session and I found a bug that is causing an endless loop, and while there are indeed other things I can do to kill the program I figured I'd ask what the PDB command is to do it.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The pdb command to kill the program is <code>q</code>, or <code>quit</code>. Quoting the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#pdbcommand-quit" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>q(uit)</strong><br/>
  Quit from the debugger. The program being executed is aborted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When <code>q</code> is not enough to stop the loop (perhaps you have a misbehaving <code>except</code> block), you may need to use <code>os._exit()</code>, a low-level command which terminates the process immediately. (<code>q</code> and <code>sys.exit</code> work by throwing exceptions - <code>bdb.BdbQuit</code> for <code>q</code> and <code>SystemExit</code> for <code>sys.exit</code>.) <code>os._exit</code> will prevent any <code>finally</code> blocks or <code>__exit__</code> methods from running, so you may have to deal with data corruption or data loss.</p>
<p>Ex: <code>import os; os._exit(0)</code></p>

<span class="comment-copy">been a while ... "q" isn't it? Google pdb cheat sheet</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have no idea why the existing <code>q</code> answer was deleted. It's the documented tool for the job.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's been a year since I asked, but I didn't know about this function and I would imagine it would have worked in that situation. Thanks :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>q</code> is what you're normally supposed to do, though. <code>os._exit</code> will prevent things like <code>finally</code> blocks and <code>__exit__</code> methods from firing.</span>
