<p>I keep getting this error when using numpy:</p>
<pre><code>Warning (from warnings module):
  File "somepath.py", line 249
    return 1 / ( 1 + np.exp( -x))
RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in exp
</code></pre>
<p>However this doesn't tell me anything, as I still have no idea how it got to this error. Usually when I get an error it traces back through the functions it went through to get to the error, but not with exp overflow. </p>
<p>How do I get an error in which it does show me this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can ask Python to turn the warning into an error:</p>
<pre><code>import warnings    
warnings.filterwarnings("error", category=RuntimeWarning)
</code></pre>
