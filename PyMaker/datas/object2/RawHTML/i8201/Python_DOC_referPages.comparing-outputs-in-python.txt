<p>Below is simplified example of a larger program i'm working on that is meant to create a single number from some inputs and then compare the two numbers, by saying which one is bigger. In this case is a computer and all its parts have a number and all those numbers added together form an overall number that I want to used to compare computers. Can someone suggest what would be the best method to do this?</p>
<pre><code>class compcomputer:

    def __init__(self,cpu,ram,graph):
        self.cpu = cpu
        self.ram = ram
        self.graph = graph

    def __int__(self, other):
        number = (int(0.4*self.cpu) + 0.2*int(self.ram) + 0.2*int(self.graph))
        return number

computer1 = compcomputer(2,3,1)
computer2 = compcomputer(7,3,3)
</code></pre>
<p>I am looking for a way to compare the resulting numbers of computer1 and computer2 to tell which is bigger.Sorry for the noob question as I'm sure there is a simple solution i'm overlooking. Thank you in advance for your guidance.</p>

<p>I recommend adding a <strong>gt</strong> and <strong>lt</strong> method to your class that operates on an instance variable that you generate. Like this:</p>
<pre><code>class CompComputer:

    def __init__(self,cpu,ram,graph):
        self.cpu = cpu
        self.ram = ram
        self.graph = graph
        self.score = self.generate_score()

    def generate_score(self):
        number = (int(0.4  *self.cpu) + 0.2 * int(self.ram) + 0.2 * int(self.graph))
        return number

    def __gt__(self, other):
        return self.score &gt; other.score

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.score &lt; other.score

computer1 = CompComputer(2,3,1)
computer2 = CompComputer(7,3,3)

print(computer1 &gt; computer2)
print(computer1 &lt; computer2)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean about comparing? Why not using c1 &gt; c2?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I am trying to ding a way to so "computer2  is larger than computer1" by running their input through the equation in def__int__ to get a resulting number for each.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You cannot compare a two instances of a class, inside of the class definition itself. You will need to do a simple comparison outside of the <code>__init__</code> method, as proposed by @mohammad.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so do you mean something along the lines of............                                          if (computer1 &gt; computer2):     print("computer1 is greater") else:     print("computer2 is greater")</span>
