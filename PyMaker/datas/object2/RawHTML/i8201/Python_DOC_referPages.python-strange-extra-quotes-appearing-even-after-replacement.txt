<p>So basically I'm working on File/IO practice with some dictionary shenanigans and whenever I have a string inside my returning tuple value in my dictionary entry it has extra quotes even if I use .replace. It gets a little weird in the middle because in the file has a bunch of Pokemon and "stats" separated by commas and sometimes the names have a comma so I made it operate by how long the list was after the split by comma</p>

<pre><code>def read_info_file(filename):
d={}
with open(filename,'r') as f:
    next(f)
    for line in f:
        h=line.split(',')
        if len(h)==7:
            h[1]=str(h[1]+','+h[2])
            h[2]=h[3]
            h[3]=h[4]
            h[4]=int(h[5])
            h[5]=h[6] 

            h[1].replace("\"","")
            h[2].replace("\"","")
            h[3].replace("\"","")
            h[5].replace("\"","")
            #if there are more than 5 items due to a naming convention
            #concatanate the name parts and reorder the list properly
        d[h[1]]=int(h[0]),h[2],h[3],int(h[4]),h[5]
        #final assignment

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Python <code>str</code> is immutable; <code>str.replace</code> returns a new string, it doesn't change the existing string. Replaced, then threw away the result.</p>
<p>You need to assign the result for the quotes to be stripped, e.g. replacing:</p>
<pre><code>h[1].replace("\"","")  # Does replace and throws away result
</code></pre>
<p>with:</p>
<pre><code>h[1] = h[1].replace("\"","")  # Does replace and replaces original object with new object
</code></pre>
<p>Note: If you're just trying to strip leading and trailing quotes, I'd suggest <code>h[1] = h[1].strip('"')</code> which is specialized for removing characters from the ends (without checking the middle).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure what you're asking. Do you mean the extra single-quotes around 'Bulbasaur'? That's just to indicate it's a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It looks like you're parsing CSV. Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>csv</code> module</a>, and it will handle quoted fields for you. Don't waste time reinventing CSV parsing, badly.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The first element in the <code>h</code> list is <code>h[0]</code> which you are not replacing... Is that what you mean by your strange extra qutotes?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Those don't look like standard quotes to me. These are standard: <code>' "</code> These are not: <code>‘’ “”</code></span>
