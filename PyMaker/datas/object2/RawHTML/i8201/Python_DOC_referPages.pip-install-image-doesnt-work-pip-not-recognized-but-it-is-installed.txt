<p>I have python 36. The path is already declared, yet when I enter</p>
<pre><code>python pip install image
</code></pre>
<p>nothing happens, and I am told that pip does not exist. I have install openpyxl before via pip, so I know I have it....but I can't remember how I got it to work.</p>
<p>I recall it being an alternative way of typing it into the CMD that finally made it work.</p>
<p>Typing in a path to the python36 or python .exe file instead of python, the CMD still does not recognize pip</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to pass <code>-m</code> so that Python will execute the <code>pip</code> module, like this:</p>
<pre><code>python -m pip install image
</code></pre>
<p>On Windows, especially if you have multiple versions of Python installed, use the <code>py</code> launcher, like this:</p>
<pre><code>py -3 -m pip install image
</code></pre>
