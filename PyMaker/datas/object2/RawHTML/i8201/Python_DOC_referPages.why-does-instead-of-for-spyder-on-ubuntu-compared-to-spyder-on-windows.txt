<p>I wrote a python script, where I need to read and write a file. I first wrote it on Windows, and the when I tried to execute the same code on Ubuntu(Linux), using the same Python Shell (Spyder), I got this message error "No such file or directory:"data.csv". I had many attempts to fix this trouble, at the end, I found out that I need to change all '\' by '//' inside my code. So, everything is working well right now, but WHY!?</p>

<p>Because Windows uses backslashes as directory separators, and POSIX systems (including Linux) use <em>forward</em> slashes. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.sep" rel="noreferrer"><code>os.sep</code> constant</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The character used by the operating system to separate pathname components. This is <code>'/'</code> for POSIX and <code>'\\'</code> for Windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always use the <code>os.path</code> module to construct paths; it'll take care of platform differences.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@Mack That's a completely different use for backslash.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>pathlib</code> is another option for handling paths in cross-platform code -- especially in 3.6+ in which there's better support for it in the standard library.</span>
