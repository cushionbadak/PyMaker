<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have this IF, OR statement:</p>
<pre><code>a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4

if a == 5 or b == 5 or c == 5 or d == 5:
    # do something
else:
    # do something different
</code></pre>
<p>I was wondering if this is the best way to write it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could just use the <code>element in list</code> syntax. Also, there's no need to use an <code>if else</code> statement if you only want to print <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. You could just print the boolean directly:</p>
<pre><code>print(5 in [a, b, c, d])
# False
</code></pre>
<p>If you want a lowercase string:</p>
<pre><code>print(str(5 in [a, b, c, d]).lower())
# "false"
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, if you often need this test, you could pack the values into a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#set" rel="nofollow noreferrer">set</a>:</p>
<pre><code>a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4
all_values = set([a, b, c, d])
</code></pre>
<p>You'll invest some time to create the set, but the query <code>5 in all_values</code> should become faster, especially if there are many variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This would be preferable in my eyes.</p>
<pre><code>if any(x==5 for x in (a, b, c, d)):
   ...
</code></pre>
<p>You can take a look at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a></p>
<p>Similarly if you want to do multiple <code>and</code> checks you can use <code>all()</code> with the same syntax.</p>
<p>Finally, for your special case, and since the only thing you want to do is a membership test I would go with the answer posted by @Eric. My approach is more generic.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <code>if 5 in [a, b, c,d]:</code></p>
<p>In case if you want to check equality of variables with different number <code>any()</code> is a safe bet</p>
<p><code>if any([a == 1, b == 2, c == 3, d == 4]):</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Perhaps by just using <code>in</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if 5 in (a,b,c,d):
    print('true')
else:
    print('false')
</code></pre>
<p>or just</p>
<pre><code>print(5 in (a,b,c,d))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">For premature optimization, use a <code>set</code> instead of <code>list</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Chris_Rands: Just in case it wasn't 100% sarcasm, I added a note about sets.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Whats the advantage of using a <code>set</code> over a <code>list</code>, is it just faster?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Lewis909 With many variables (let's say 1000), it should be much faster, yes. Otherwise, as mentioned by Chris_Rands, it would be premature optimization.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I prefer this one for readability over <code>5 in [...</code> solutions. It also generalizes nicely for any logical-valued expression using <code>x</code>, not just equality.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I appreciate the answer, as someone learning Python its useful to see the different solutions to a problem.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was using <code>print</code> as an example of the if statement doing something, I have edited the question to reflect this.</span>
