<p>I am trying to make a chat app where one pc connects directly to another. I have encountered an issue with not being able to connect to my laptop from an external network despite forwarding the right port on the router.</p>
<p>I have tried Flask and was able to connect to my laptop from an external network. I guess it does some port forwarding magic.</p>
<p>How can I use Flask to send raw data from client to server and server to client? Is there a code sample for this? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Flask is only useful to develop an application which runs inside a web server. The underlying protocole is HTTP.</p>
<p>What you want is an application which use it own protocol (homemade protocol? or have you found any standard? XMPP?) and can work as <strong>client</strong> and <strong>server</strong>. You need a bidirectional protocol. For that, you can use XML-RPC. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xmlrpc.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">xmlrpc</a> package in the Python documentation.</p>
<p>If your PCs don't connect, it may be a firewall configuration problem. Have you opened the right port number? See this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/3452161">question for XMPP</a>.</p>
