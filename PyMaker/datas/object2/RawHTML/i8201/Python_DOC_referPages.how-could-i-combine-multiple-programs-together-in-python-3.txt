<p>I have a few different programs I want to combine into one big program, but I'm not sure how to do that. My programs are: </p>
<pre><code>import random
Level = int(input('What level is the chest?'))
GP = (random.randint(0, 10))
SP = (random.randint(10, 50))
CP = (random.randint(0, 100))

print ((GP * Level),'GP')
print ((SP * Level),'SP')
print ((CP * Level),'CP')
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>Number = int(input('How many dice would you like to roll?'))
Sides =  int(input('How many sides?'))
import random
for Number in range(Number):
  print (random.randint(1, Sides))
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>import random
classes = ["Dwarf","Elf","Halfling","Human","Dragonborn","Gnome","Half-
Elf","Half-Orc","Tiefling"]
r = random.randint(1, 9)
print("Your class is {}".format(classes[r - 1]))
</code></pre>
<p>I would also like to know how to add new programs to this. (Yes this is D&amp;D)</p>

<p>If you'd like to run any of these blocks during the course of play, you  could use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">functions</a> and a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-while-statement" rel="nofollow noreferrer">while</a> loop to choose which block to run. Maybe something like this:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">just paste them into one file in the order you need them to run. Remove duplicate imports. Whats the issue?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do you want the big program to behave?  Do you want it to do the functions exactly in the order shown -- chest, then dice, then class?  If so, then you can just paste the code together into one big file and run it.</span>
