<p>So I am trying to run this command <code>if r"\" in text:</code> and it doesn't work. It thinks the whole line is a string. How do I fix this?</p>

<p>Raw literals aren't <em>completely</em> raw.  The relevant paragraph of documentation is at the very bottom of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals" rel="noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals</a>, just before the next section ("String literal concatenation") begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even in a raw literal, quotes can be escaped with a backslash, but the backslash remains in the result; for example, <code>r"\""</code> is a valid string literal consisting of two characters: a backslash and a double quote; <code>r"\"</code> is not a valid string literal (even a raw string cannot end in an odd number of backslashes). Specifically, <em>a raw literal cannot end in a single backslash</em> (since the backslash would escape the following quote character). Note also that a single backslash followed by a newline is interpreted as those two characters as part of the literal, not as a line continuation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis in original.)</p>
<p>So, you can write <code>r"\\"</code> and get a string containing <em>two</em> backslashes, and you can write <code>r"\""</code> and get a string containing one backslash and one double-quote character, but if you want a string containing <em>just one backslash</em>, you can't do it with a raw literal.  You need to write <code>"\\"</code> instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use this:</p>
<pre><code>"\\"
</code></pre>
<p>That is, an escaped backslash, rather than an escaped quote.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are struggling with the escaping characters.</p>
<p>Because <code>\</code> is an escaping character you have to escape it to mean "<em>this character</em>" and not "<em>what following will be escaped</em>".</p>
<pre><code>if '\\' in 'foo\\':
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>if "\\" in text
</code></pre>
<p>This should work, you just need to escape it</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>if r"\\" in text</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Special characters need escaping.</span>
