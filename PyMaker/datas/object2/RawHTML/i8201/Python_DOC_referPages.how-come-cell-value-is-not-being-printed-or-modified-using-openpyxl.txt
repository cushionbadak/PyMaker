<p>Here is my code. path2 is the path of the new file that is created and being modified.  There are indeed cells inside the .xlsx file that contain "4/1/2017"</p>
<pre><code>wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(path2, read_only=False)
ws = wb.active
for row in ws.iter_rows():
    for cell in row:
        if cell.internal_value == "4/1/2017":
            print(cell.value)
            cell.internal_value = endDate          
wb.save(path2)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are comparing the cell value against the string <code>"4/1/2017"</code>, but it is likely that the cell actually contains a date value that is formatted by Excel to look like <code>4/1/2017' in the spreadsheet. If the cell actually contains a date, then</code>openpyxl<code>will read it as a</code>datetime` object and you need to test the cell value against a datetime with the correct value.</p>
<pre><code>import datetime

if cell.value == datetime.datetime(2017, 4, 1):
    print(cell.value)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>cell.internal_value</code> for a date is a <code>float</code> value, which is the way that Excel stores dates. If you want to test this, you'll need to compare it against the float representation of the date.</p>
<p>If you have a string specifying a date and you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.datetime.strptime()</code></a> to convert the string into a datetime object for comparing with the cell contents.</p>
<pre><code>date = datetime.datetime.strptime("4/1/2017", "%m/%d/%Y")
if cell.value == date:
    print(cell.value)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">thanks so much! I managed to figure that part out also on my own!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is great, but how about if i would also like to mody cells that contain a date range such as 4/1/17-4/31/17, and not only the 4/1/17 cells?  How does one compare to an actual string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Alex I'm not sure what you are asking. Please edit your question with a clear example of the cell contents you are trying to parse.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What I mean is, is there a way to directly test a value in a cell against a string?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Alex If the cell contains a string, then test it against a string. If it contains a date, then test it against a date. If you want to use a string like <code>"4/1/2017"</code> to specify a date, then use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.datetime.strptime()</code></a> to convert the string into a datetime object.</span>
