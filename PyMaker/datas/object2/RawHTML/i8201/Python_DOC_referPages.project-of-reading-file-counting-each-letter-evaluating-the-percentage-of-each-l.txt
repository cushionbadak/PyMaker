<p>I tried these codes but they are \ not working properly.It is showing the file in vertical lines and not showing the percentages properly what do I have to do for it?I just did what our teacher asked us but its not working.</p>

<p>So here's how I would actually write this program:</p>
<pre><code># Allows us to get a list of a-z.
import string
# Allows us to use an OrderedDict.
import collections

# Creates an OrderedDict (like a normal dict but maintains key order),
# with the keys a-z and the starting values of 0.
total_counts = collections.OrderedDict().fromkeys(list(string.ascii_lowercase),0)
# Counter for totally number of characters.
total_chars = 0

# Opens the file "file.txt" from the same directory as the script.
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    # Processes it line by line.
    for line in f:
        # Removes captialization.
        line = line.lower()
        # Processes each character in line.
        for c in line:
            # Checks if c is in a-z (and not say a space or puncutation).
            if c in total_counts:
                # Adds count to the specific character and the overall number.
                total_counts[c] += 1
                total_chars += 1

# Iterates the OrderdDict and prints the percentage.
for character, count in total_counts.iteritems():
    print("Count of the letter " + character + " is " + str(count) + "\t" + str(float(count)/total_chars*100))
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, I'm not writing <code>if</code> and <code>print</code> statements for every letter, but rather using loops to minimize the code required.</p>
<p>Most lines are commented, but if you have any questions let me know. </p>
<p>Also I wrote this in Python3 and converted it back to Python2.* (which I believe is what you're using), so their might be slight errors. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">As a general rule of thumb: if you are repeating yourself very often in your code, then you should try another way. Let the program handle similar cases, not the programmer. In your case, have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Counter</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">+ What other comments can I add to these codes?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">First of all, please read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a>. In your case, specify what "not working properly" means. What output does your code produce, what should it produce? If it gives you an error message and a traceback, add this to your question. A first look shows that your function body should be indented one level deeper than <code>def CharCount(): #Defines function</code>.</span>
