<p>As a new python programmer. I try to create and solve problems myself. I use Python 3.</p>
<p>Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code>def next():
    print ("how_much="),
    if input = 50:
        print("Nice, you're not greedy, you win"),
    else:
        print("You greedy bastard!")
</code></pre>
<p>I want to convert the value to integer and print "Nice, you're not greedy, you win" if the number is 50. otherwise print "Nice, you're not greedy, you win".</p>
<p>I inspired to create above code based on this code:</p>
<pre><code>def is_int(x):
    print round(x),
    if x == round(x):
        print 'True',
    else:
        print 'False'

is_int(7.0)   # True
is_int(7.5)   # False
is_int(-1)    # True
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You just need add <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int" rel="nofollow noreferrer">int()</a> to convert to integer, and change '=' (assignment) to '=='(comparing)</p>
<pre><code>def next_int(x)
    input = int(x) # convert string to integer
    if input == 50:
        print("Nice, you're not greedy, you win")
    else:
        print("You greedy bastard!")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>if you want to find out if a variable is a an int you can just do this:
(works on python 2.7, check on 3..)</p>
<pre><code>def is_int(x):
     return type(x) == int 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">1. Use <code>==</code> for comparison, <code>=</code> for assignment 2. you are shadowing the function <code>next</code> 3. you have an unnecessary trailing comma after <code>True</code>. But most importantly it isn't clear what your question is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm a bit confused. You need to use <code>input</code> (or <code>raw_input</code> for Python 2.7) to get users to be able to interact with your program (<code>print</code> doesn't allow them to respond). You also have <code>if how_much = 50:</code> which will fail, because you need to use <code>==</code> for comparisons. Your code for <code>is_int()</code> seems to do what you want. What exactly are you asking as there's no question, just a statement?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There is no actual question in the original post, and I'm not sure what this addresses. Also, this code has multiple errors (<code>print ("how much:" + x)</code> does nothing useful because it doesn't elicit a response from a user).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yeah, the original post is quite vague. But based on the code the OP used, it doesn't look like he needs to get input from user - mentioned function also doesn't take any input from user. But i get your point.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">guys all I try to do is,                                                                                                         if next_int(50) it will print "Nice, you're not greedy, you win"                                            otherwise it will print "You greedy bastard!"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't copy and paste. I created an original code from inspiring other code which I found here on stack overflow</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PravinNath i edited my answer, it should do what you want now. Please also edit the initial question so it isn't vague.</span>
