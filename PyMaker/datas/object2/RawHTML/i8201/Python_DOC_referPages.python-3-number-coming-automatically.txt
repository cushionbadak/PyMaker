<p>Hi, </p>
<p>i have written this code below, every time i run it it gives some number like 16, 23 see attached jpeg image it has number 13, can someone explain?</p>
<pre><code>from sys import argv
script, filename = argv

print ("I will show you magic")
print (open(filename).read())

target = open(filename, "w")
target.truncate()

# now i will show you more magic

print("lets do this")

line1 = input("what do you want to print type it in, ok?, ")
line2 = input("i dont understand this, ")
line3 = input("type again please, ")
print (target.write(f"{line1} \n{line2} \n{line3}"))
target = open(filename)
print (target.read())
</code></pre>

<p>You are printing the return value of <code>target.write()</code>. That method returns the number of characters written. From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.write" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>TextIOBase.write()</code> documenatation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write the string <em>s</em> to the stream and return the number of characters written.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 13 indicates you wrote 13 characters to a file. If you se 26, then you wrote twice as much information to the file. If you didn't want to print that, simply remove the <code>print()</code> call, and only call <code>target.write()</code>.</p>
