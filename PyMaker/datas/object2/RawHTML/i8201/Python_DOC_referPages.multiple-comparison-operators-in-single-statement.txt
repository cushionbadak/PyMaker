<p>Does this do what I think it does?</p>
<pre><code>assert 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3
</code></pre>
<p>I couldn't find any reference to this in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a> but I saw it in a high rep <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/16424639/4653485">answer</a>.</p>
<p>It seems to work but it could be luck, like the leftmost resolves to <code>True</code>, then <code>True</code> is used in the other.</p>
<p>I did a few tests and it always work as expected, but I'd like to find a source (a doc) stating explicitly that it is intended.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1&lt;2&lt;3&lt;4&lt;5
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1&lt;2&lt;7&lt;4&lt;5
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1&lt;2&lt;3&gt;2&lt;5
True
</code></pre>
<p>This rules out the "leftmost first" hypothesis:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 1&lt;3&lt;2
False
&gt;&gt;&gt; (1&lt;3)&lt;2
True
</code></pre>

<p>This is documented in detail in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/expressions.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Expressions</a> chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily, e.g., <code>x &lt; y &lt;= z</code> is equivalent
  to <code>x &lt; y</code> and <code>y &lt;= z</code>, except that <code>y</code> is evaluated only once (but in both
  cases <code>z</code> is not evaluated at all when <code>x &lt; y</code> is found to be false).</p>
<p>Formally, if <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, ..., <em>y</em>, <em>z</em> are expressions and <em>op1</em>, <em>op2</em>, ..., <em>opN</em>
  are comparison operators, then <code>a op1 b op2 c ... y opN z</code> is equivalent
  to <code>a op1 b and b op2 c and ... y opN z</code>, except that each expression is
  evaluated at most once.</p>
<p>Note that <code>a op1 b op2 c</code> doesnâ€™t imply any kind of comparison between <em>a</em>
  and <em>c</em>, so that, e.g., <code>x &lt; y &gt; z</code> is perfectly legal (though perhaps not
  pretty).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@PeterWood. You're right. I somehow missed it. Should I delete this question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks. "Chaining" is the search keyword I was missing. I couldn't find anything relevant searching for "multiple".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's exactly the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#comparisons" rel="nofollow noreferrer">same text</a> (albeit a different part of the documentation) that the OP linked.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Peter: only the 1st paragraph ;)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@eugeney yes you updated with more text, cheeky.</span>
