<p>Friends, I'm doing some simple experiments using python socket, where I've a HOSTNAME which resolves with two IP addresses but when I use, <br/> <br/> <code>socket.gethostbyname('demo.sample.com')</code> <br/> <br/> I'm getting only one IP address. why it's showing that way? is there any other way I can get multiple IP addresses? Please guide me.</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance!</p>
<p><strong>EDIT - 1</strong></p>
<p>I Got it guys, Instead of <code>gethostbyname('demo.sample.com')</code> <br/>I tried <code>gethostbyname_ex('demo.sample.com')</code> <br/> It gives the result as i expected.</p>
<p>Thanks to All</p>

<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.gethostbyname" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the documentation</a> it is visible that:</p>
<ul>
<li>gethostbyname returns only a single IPv4 address. And to cite:<br/> <em>See gethostbyname_ex() for a more complete interface.</em></li>
<li>gethostbyname_ex will return multiple IPv4 address, but check out the usage. And to cite:<br/> <em>gethostbyname_ex() does not support IPv6 name resolution, and getaddrinfo() should be used instead for IPv4/v6 dual stack support.</em></li>
<li>getaddrinfo will return all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, but check out the usage.</li>
</ul>

<span class="comment-copy">Normally DNS resolves a single host to a single IP address. Why do you expect more than one?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is just a wrapper around the C library <code>gethostbyname</code>, which gives you just one answer if any.  If you want to dig into DNS details, you need a DNS module such as <code>pydns</code> or <a href="http://www.dnspython.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dnspython</code></a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Alexander O'Mara It is possible to assign multiple IP to a single hostname, I want to know what are the ip addresses assigned for the hostname I give, Simply to say, I just want the results of <code>nslookup</code> command in linux</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AlexanderO'Mara if you are calling gethostbyname on a device that is on your LAN, your query doesn't make it to the DNS. Any of your devices can have multiple interfaces, each with their own IP. I have about 6 different interfaces/IPs on my laptop (some of them are VirtualBox adapters).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I get it, Thanks a lot</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I just get it a while ago, from the docs anyway Thanks a lot</span>
