<p>I have written some simple Linux shell script. Now I am trying to figure out is that can I have a GUI developed with python and trigger my shell scripts from the GUI. 
Is this possible. How can I do this. Any ideas or examples please.<br/>

<p><strong>Just make sure the python executable is in your PATH environment variable then add in your script</strong></p>
<p>python path/to/the/python_script.py
Details:</p>
<p><strong>In the file job.sh, put this</strong></p>
<h1>!/bin/sh</h1>
<p>python python_script.py</p>
<p><strong>Execute this command to make the script runnable for you : chmod u+x job.sh
Run it : ./job.sh</strong></p>

<span class="comment-copy">1) google "python gui" 2) open first answer, that is <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python wiki</a>. 3) choose framework 4) go to that framework's tutorials. <b>///</b> Worth a read as well, python's official <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/gui.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GUI FAQ</a>.</span>
