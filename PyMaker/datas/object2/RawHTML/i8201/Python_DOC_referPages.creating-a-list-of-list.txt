<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You appear to have tab-delimited columns, use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code> module</a> to read that format:</p>
<pre><code>import csv

with open("myfile.txt") as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter='\t')
    user = list(reader)
</code></pre>
<p>If the lines are not tab-separated but simply are space separated, you want to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>str.split()</code></a> on each line (which splits on <em>runs of whitespace</em>):</p>
<pre><code>with open("myfile.txt") as f:
    user = [line.split() for line in f]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this'll get you separate words even if the tab-delimited format would perhaps have given you word groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You might have meant to use <code>[i.split() for i in res]</code>. While <code>strip</code> removes leading and trailing whitespace from a string, <code>split</code> separates it into separate tokens based on whitespace.</p>
<p>Still, a better option is to use something from either the <code>csv</code> library or from Pandas.</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_table("myfile.txt")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>split()</code></p>
<pre><code>with open("myfile.txt") as f:
    print([i.split() for i in f])

<span class="comment-copy">Are those <i>tab</i>-sparated lines perhaps? Use the <code>csv</code> module to read that into a list of lists.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's hard to say excactly without knowning if that are tabs, but try <code>[ i.split() for i in res.split('\n') ]</code> on your data.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And are you sure you want <i>each word</i> as a separate element? I strongly suspect that some of those entries are word <i>groups</i>, only separated by a single space, while each column is separated by a tab.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Adrija: also, you say you edited the post but that edit appears to have been lost when my edit was applied. Can you please verify that the information you meant to add is there?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters Yes that was confusing to me as well. But then I reloaded, and your edits are visible now. Thanks again for your help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your help. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MartijnPieters edited, please check, need you suggestions over this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why readlines? you can just iterate over <code>f</code> directly. No need to waste memory on a list of lines you then replace with a list of lists.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sir @MartijnPieters, let me try</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you want to keep it, that's your choice. You may want to explain why it works perhaps?</span>
