<p>I need to load around 200 images in pygame to be blitted at various points in my game. I tried writing a function for this but kept coming back with <code>NameError: name 'tomato' is not defined</code>.</p>
<p>All of the image names are what the variable of the loaded image is stored under: <code>tomato = pygame.image.load("tomato.png")</code></p>
<p>Would using an array be better, if so how would I do that?</p>
<p>The code:</p>
<pre><code>def load(image):
    imagename = image
    imagetitle = str(imagename)+".png"
    image = pygame.image.load(imagetitle)
    return image

load("tomato")

def blit_f(fruit):
    gamedisplay.blit(fruit,(0,0))
    pygame.display.update()

fruitlist = []        

running = False
while not running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = True

        if event.type == pygame.MOUSEMOTION:
            mouse = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
            color = screen.get_at(mouse)

            if color == (209,0,0,255):
                blit_f(tomato)
                fruitlist.insert(0,"tomato")

        if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:

            if fruitlist[0] == "tomato":
                gamedisplay.blit(tomato,(0,0))
                pygame.display.update()
</code></pre>
<p>The NameError occurs only when the condition leading to the blitting of <code>tomato.png</code> is met: when I hover over the tomato image i.e. color red</p>
<p>If I write <code>load(tomato)</code> instead of with <code>""</code>, NameError comes up as soon as I run the code, and highlights <code>load(tomato)</code> instead of <code>gamedisplay.blit(tomato)</code> as for with <code>load("tomato")</code>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You do load the image by calling <code>load("tomato")</code>, but you ignore the return value. Try</p>
<pre><code>tomato = load("tomato")
</code></pre>
<p>instead.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to load so many images, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.listdir</code></a> and put all the images in the directory into a dictionary. Also, use <code>convert</code> or <code>convert_alpha</code> after loading the images to improve the performance.</p>
<pre><code>def load_images(path_to_directory):
    """Load images and return them as a dict."""

            key = filename[:-4]
            image_dict[key] = pygame.image.load(path).convert()
    return image_dict
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to load all images from subdirectories as well, use <code>os.walk</code>:</p>

                img = pygame.image.load(os.path.join(dirpath, name)).convert()
                images[key] = img

<span class="comment-copy">where is your code showing that you try to use tomato before defining it?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">check order of operations in your code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Edit your original question with the code you're using to cause this error @I.Kaur</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The function had parameter load(image) and load(tomato) came after the function. The error highlighted a later line: gamedisplay.blit(tomato)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Show <i>all</i> of your code, the problem is <code>tomato</code> isn't defined at the time of you calling <code>load(tomato)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I kept the function as is and used this line, and it worked - doing this for 199 more images is a little less tedious than before, thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How can I load many images from 7 sub files that are in a file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do you mean you want to load all images in 7 subdirectories? Then you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.walk</code></a> or use the function that I showed you above several times (then you would get 7 different dictionaries).</span>
