<p>I am trying to name and access variables using an index in a loop.
It's a bit hard to express in code what I want to achieve, but the output is the important thing:</p>
<pre><code>i = 0
while i &lt; len(myAr): #myAr is an array that has different length each run
   var_i = i*5       
   print (var_i)
   i = i+1

   #So, say, len(myAr) = 3, my output will be:
   var_0 = 0
   var_1 = 5
   var_2 = 10
</code></pre>
<p>I have tried using a list as  suggested in previous posts, however, this is not what I am looking for as in the 'list' solution I cannot really access the variable but only its location in a list. 
Or, in other words, I cannot call that variable directly, but only its location in the list.</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import count

variables = {}

myAr = 'adf'
counter = count()
i = counter.next()

while i &lt; len(myAr): #myAr is an array that has different length each run
    var_name = 'var_{}'.format(i)
    variables[var_name] = i*5
    print variables[var_name]
    i = counter.next()

locals().update(variables)
print var_0, var_1, var_2
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>myAr = [1,2,3]

for i in range(len(myAr)):
    val = i * 5
    print val
</code></pre>
<p>The length of <code>myAr</code> is 3, and this is the output:</p>
<pre><code>0
5
10
</code></pre>
<p>If you want the output to be EXACTLY like the output you provided in the question, you would change the print line to this: <code>print 'var_{} = {}'.format(i, val)</code> which for this example would output:</p>
<pre><code>var_0 = 0
var_1 = 5
var_2 = 10
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>i=0;
while i&lt;3:
    var_i=i*5
    print(var_i)
    i=i+1

<p>This is the output, you can manipulate it as you want.  </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Do you want to multiply the index of the element by 5 or the element itself by 5? I don't really understand what you want here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Would a dictionary work for you? I.e. <code>myvars['var_0'] = 0</code> then accessed as <code>myvars['var_0']</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Would a dictionary be more appropriate?  What do you mean by accessing a variable?  In python a variable is a name referencing an object, nothing more.  Do you mean using an array as in the array module, or something else?  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/array.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would like to name a series of variables using an index, and then later - print those variables (who`s name differ only by an index number)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Please refer to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/5036700/6194391">stackoverflow.com/q/5036700/6194391</a>. Question seems to be a duplicate though.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>locals()</code> doesn't do what you think it does here... it shouldn't be mutated...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NinjaPuppy thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That should work, but, is there a way to access these variables using a loop too? i.e:      'while counter&lt;len(myAr):         print(var_counter)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Gimmie a second.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Yair now it's done.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The idea is that the variable will be named: var_0, var_1 etc... not only the printout.</span>
