<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I've created a class called <code>Earthquake</code> which stores relevant earthquake data (its magnitude, time it hit, etc.) in class variables. I want to ask the user which data they'd like to see, then print out that data for them like so:</p>
<pre><code>earthquake1 = Earthquake()

answer = input("What data would you like to see?")
print(earthquake1.answer)
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, if the user answers <code>magnitude</code>, I want to print out the class variable <code>earthquake1.magnitude</code>.</p>
<p>Is there some way of doing this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just use <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/python-getattr.htm" rel="nofollow"><code>getattr</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>earthquake1 = Earthquake()

answer = input("What data would you like to see?")
print(getattr(earthquake1, answer))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <code>getattr</code> which is equivalent to <code>earthquake.attr_name</code>. The difference is that <code>getattr</code> allows you to use a variable to access the name and supply a default value if that is not found.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<pre><code> print(getattr(earthquake1, answer))
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you need to use a default value instead of raising a <code>KeyError</code>:</p>
<pre><code>print(getattr(earthquake1, answer, "Instance variable {} not found".format(answer)))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Probably <code>getattr</code>... also easily done with <code>eval</code> but <code>eval</code> is evil</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@dfasoro I'd rather not use if statements because I've got over 20 attributes</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ok, @A.J. 's answer below should suffice, I will suggest you sanitize/filter the input in case you have some attributes (asides the 20) in the earthquake object you don't necessarily want the user to see.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do <code>Earthquake</code> instances know about what earthquake they're about?</span>
