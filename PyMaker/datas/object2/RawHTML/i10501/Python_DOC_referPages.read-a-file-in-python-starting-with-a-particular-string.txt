<p>I have a file in the following path:</p>
<pre><code>/home/[user]/foo_01-01-2016.txt
</code></pre>
<p>I need to read it using the wild card (*) character:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("/home/[user]/foo_*.txt")
</code></pre>
<p>But its giving a file not found error.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow"><code>glob</code></a>, but output is list, so select first item by <code>[0]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import glob

path =r'/home/[user]'
filename = glob.glob(path + "/foo_*.txt")
print (filename[0])

df = pd.read_csv(filename[0])
print (df)

<span class="comment-copy">I don't think in that case <a href="https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Path_name_expansion" rel="nofollow noreferrer">path expansion</a> is supported. I would use this: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>*</code> is used by a shell.  If you use it from any other language you have to translate it yourself, one way is to use <code>glob</code> from the Python standard library (filename expansion is known as <i>globbing</i>).<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice! Thanks man</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If my answer was helpful, don't forget <a href="http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/5235/295067">accept</a> it. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is that 'r' before the file path?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah, it is working both ways.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It means raw string, not regex. It prevents backslash escape translation. <code>r'\x41'</code> is 4 bytes. Without <code>r</code> it is one byte.</span>
