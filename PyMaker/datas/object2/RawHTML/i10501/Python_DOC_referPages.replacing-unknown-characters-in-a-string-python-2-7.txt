<p>How can I define characters(in a LIST or a STRING), and have any other characters replaced with.. lets say a '?'</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>strinput = "abcdefg#~"
legal = '.,/?~abcdefg' #legal characters
while i not in legal:
    #Turn i into '?'
print output
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Put the legal characters in a set then use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html?highlight=membership#membership-test-operations" rel="nofollow"><code>in</code></a> to test each character of the string.  Construct the new string using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join" rel="nofollow"><code>str.join()</code></a> method and a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#conditional-expressions" rel="nofollow">conditional expression</a>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "test.,/?~abcdefgh"
&gt;&gt;&gt; legal = set('.,/?~abcdefg')
&gt;&gt;&gt; s = ''.join(char if char in legal else '?' for char in s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; s
'?e??.,/?~abcdefg?'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If this is a large file, read in chunks, and apply <code>re.sub(..)</code> as below. <code>^</code> within a class (square brackets) stands for negation (similar to saying "anything other than")</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; char = '.,/?~abcdefg'
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(r'[^' + char +']', '?', "test.,/?~abcdefgh")
'?e??.,/?~abcdefg?'
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Will any of the characters you care to keep be non-ASCII?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"My question is, how can I define characters(in a LIST or a STRING), and have any other characters replaced with.. lets say a '?'" Why would you use a list or string? Seems like a great job for a dict, if you were going to take such a simple approach. Undefined? Catch a <code>KeyError</code> and deal with it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How can i use a dictionary if i do not know the characters that i cannot use? @Two-BitAlchemist</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I thought you were saying you defined your own encoding of sorts, meaning you're mapping "legal" input characters to defined output characters. That sounds like a perfect job for a dict to me, and thus an illegal character would be the case where you looked in the dict but it was not there (<code>try ... except KeyError: print('this character is not defined')</code>)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">For now, the only characters I will be keeping are "a-zA-Z0-9 and ~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+|-=\{}[]:";'&lt;&gt;?,./" but I would prefer to be able to edit that list quickly in case I need to allow more characters, or remove characters. For example, i CAN NOT allow the usage of ' ` ' in my code because of the way i generate my binary/hex.  @mark-ransom</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, i forgot to mention that i will not be editing the file directly, and instead have the contents saved to a string. I edited my question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Almost all answers here on StackOverflow are generic. I am sure you can take the idea of <code>re.sub(..)</code> further..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AustinSmith - this accomplishes what you need.</span>
