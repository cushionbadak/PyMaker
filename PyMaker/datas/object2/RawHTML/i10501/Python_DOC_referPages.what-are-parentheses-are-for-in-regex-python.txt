<p>I searched in all the internet and didnt get a good answer on this thing.
What parentheses in python are stand for? its very wierd..
For example, if i do:</p>
<pre><code>re.split(r'(/s*)', "ho from there")
</code></pre>
<p>its will give me a list of separate words with the spaces between that... how does its happening?</p>

<p>This isn't specific to python, but in regex those denote a capture group. </p>
<p>Further information on how these are handled in re.split can be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.split" rel="nofollow">seen here</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Rather than 'search in all the internet', try reading the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>. Or basic regex tutorials. Parentheses are an <i>extremely basic building block</i> when building regexes, no decent tutorial will leave those out. And the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.split" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>re.split()</code> documentation</a> states: <i>If <b>capturing parentheses</b> are used in pattern, then the text of all groups in the pattern are also returned as part of the resulting list.</i>.</span>
