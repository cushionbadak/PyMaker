<p>I want to know is there a way in python to make sure that the output is the same length , by adding white space or something like that.</p>
<pre><code>78364721 apple 3 3 9

<p>I want :</p>
<pre><code>78364721  apple     3 3 9
35619833  orange    4 2 8
46389121  chicken 1 10 10
total price of order £ 27

<p>Current Code :</p>
<pre><code>All_list=[items,product_list,items2,indprice_list,newprice_list]
for a in zip(*All_list):
    print(*a)

print("total price of order","£",total_price)


46389121   chicken     2 10 20
total price of order £ 40
46389121   chicken     2 10 20

<p>Here's a simple example using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow">format string syntax</a>:</p>
<pre><code># -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
dataframe = [
    [78364721, "apple", 3, 3, 9],
    [35619833, "orange", 4, 2, 8],
    [46389121, "chicken", 1, 10, 10]
]

for row in dataframe:
    print('{:8d}  {:10s}{:3d}{:3d}{:3d}'.format(
        row[0], row[1], row[2], row[3], row[4]))

print('total price of order \u00a3 {0}'.format(
    sum([row[4] for row in dataframe])))
</code></pre>
<p>If you want anything fancier than this I'd recommend you start using <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/" rel="nofollow">pandas</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yes there is a way. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Format String Syntax</a>, including the Format Specification Mini-Language, and the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-examples" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Format examples</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">How would I include that in my current code ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Most people would use an editor and type the desired code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">what do you mean ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is why i only include the python 3 tag.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JEE Oh, I hadn't seen the 3.x tag, I've edited my answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I hate people who come here just to edit my tags , like I have only included one for a reason.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JEE I added the tag for the visibility effect it has on questions, with it way more users actually see your question. I left the <code>python-3.x</code> tag specifically in order to let others know about the version you're using. It was BPL's slight mistake for not noticing it here, but he fixed that. :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JEE All Python questions should have the generic <code>python</code> tag, they may also have a version-specific tag, when relevant. Leaving out the generic tag means that people who are watching the <code>python</code> tag page will not see your question, and it also prevents people who get points answering your question from getting those points credited towards the <code>python</code> tag badges.</span>
