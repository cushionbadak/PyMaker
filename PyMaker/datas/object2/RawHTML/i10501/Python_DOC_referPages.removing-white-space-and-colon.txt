<p>I have a file with a bunch of numbers that have white spaces and colons and I am trying to remove them. As I have seen on this forum the function <code>line.strip.split()</code> works well to achieve this. Is there a way of removing the white space and colon all in one go? Using the method posted by Lorenzo I have this:</p>
<pre><code>train = []
with open('C:/Users/Morgan Weiss/Desktop/STA5635/DataSets/dexter/dexter_train.data') as train_data:
    train.append(train_data.read().replace(' ','').replace(':',''))
size_of_train = np.shape(train)
for i in range(size_of_train[0]):
    for j in range(size_of_train[1]):
        train[i][j] = int(train[i][j])
print(train)
</code></pre>
<p>Although I get this error:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>File "C:/Users/Morgan Weiss/Desktop/STA5635/Homework/Homework_1/HW1_Dexter.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
    for j in range(size_of_train[1]):
IndexError: tuple index out of range
</code></pre>

<p>I think the above syntax is not correct, but anyways as per your question, you can use replace function present in python.</p>
<p>When reading each line as a string from that file you can do something like, </p>
<pre><code>train = []
with open('/Users/sushant.moon/Downloads/dexter_train.data') as f:
    list = f.read().split()
    for x in list:
        data = x.split(':')
        train.append([int(data[0]),int(data[1])])

# this part becomes redundant as i have already converted str to int before i append data to train
size_of_train = np.shape(train) 
for i in range(size_of_train[0]): 
    for j in range(size_of_train[1]): 
        train[i][j] = int(train[i][j])
</code></pre>
<p>Here I am using replace function to replace space with blank string, and similar with colon.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You did not provide an example of what your input file looks like so we can only speculate what solution you need. I'm going to suppose that you need to extract integers from your input text file and print their values.</p>
<p>Here's how I would do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of trying to eliminate whitespace characters and colons, I will be searching for digits using a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">regular expression</a></li>
<li>Consecutive digits would constitute a number</li>
<li>I would convert this number to an integer form.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here's how it would look like:</p>
<pre><code>import re

input_filename = "/home/evens/Temporaire/Stack Exchange/StackOverflow/Input_file-39359816.txt"

matcher = re.compile(r"\d+")

with open(input_filename) as input_file:
    for line in input_file:
        for digits_found in matcher.finditer(line):
            number_in_string_form = digits_found.group()
            number = int(number_in_string_form)
            print(number)
</code></pre>
<p>But before you run away with this code, you should continue to learn Python because you don't seem to grasp its basic elements yet.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Well... you are not using valid python syntax! Grab some python tutorial and learn the loop-syntax. And <b>after</b> you did this, look at list-comprehensions.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is not valid syntax! Look into list comprehension.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok, I will do that thank you should I delete this question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure about deleting. But do your research and see if it helps. If not, edit your question with added information. If resolved, you should delete it, if there is no answer (maybe).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@sascha Ok, I read this: <a href="http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/list_comprehensions.hawk" rel="nofollow noreferrer">secnetix.de/olli/Python/list_comprehensions.hawk</a>. But this does not seem to help any recommendations?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried your method but I get this error:   train.append(train_data.replace(' ','').replace(':',''))  AttributeError: '_io.TextIOWrapper' object has no attribute 'replace'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you see my edited question?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, I have edited my answer, please give it a try.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried it please see my edited post. Perhaps my syntax is incorrect? If you would be so kind as to see what I need to do to fix it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it seems train is 1 dimensional numpy array, please try printing train before you do np.shape(train) to check if everything is according to what you require.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How does one learn Python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could start with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">official tutorial</a> for example.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok, is that necessary I used Matlab first and then went over to C++. I thought python was suppose to be rather easy</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I can send you my code and assignment I have done the assignment successfully on a different data set but this one is giving me problems. I will compensate you for the time?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It is easy but it's different from Matlab or C++. (If it wasn't why bother ?) You still have to put minimal efforts to learn it. If you don't, you'll never be able to use it to its full potential. Trust us, this is not wasted time.</span>
