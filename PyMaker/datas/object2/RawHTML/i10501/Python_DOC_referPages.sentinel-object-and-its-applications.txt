<p>I know in python the builtin <code>object()</code> returns a sentinel object. I'm curious to what it is, but mainly its applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>object</code> is the base class that all other classes inherit from in python 3. There's not a whole lot you can do with a plain old object. However an object's  <em>identity</em> could be useful. For example the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">iter</a> function takes a <code>sentinel</code> argument that signals when to stop termination. We could supply an object() to that.</p>
<pre><code>sentinel = object()

def step():
    inp = input('enter something: ')
    if inp == 'stop' or inp == 'exit' or inp == 'done':
        return sentinel
    return inp

for inp in iter(step, sentinel):
    print('you entered', inp)
</code></pre>
<p>This will ask for input until the user types stop, exit, or done. I'm not exactly sure when <code>iter</code> with a sentinel is more useful than a generator, but I guess it's interesting anyway.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this answers your question. To be clear, this is just a possible application of <code>object</code>. Fundamentally its existence in the python language has nothing to do with it being usable as a sentinel value (to my knowledge).</p>

<p>This is a source code example from the Python standard library for <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/dataclasses.py#L306" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dataclasses</a> on using sentinel values</p>
<pre><code># A sentinel object to detect if a parameter is supplied or not.  Use
# a class to give it a better repr.
class _MISSING_TYPE:
    pass
MISSING = _MISSING_TYPE()
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html</a> it makes stuff a lot easier for instance if you are taking user input you can use .lower() and even if they type caps its saved as all lower case letters. So it makes conditionals easier to deal with user input.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could I have an example of this?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">I’ve seen it used as a default value for parameters, as a replacement for None for parameters that may receive None as their value without the usual meaning of ‘this parameter has not been set by the caller’. e.g. <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/testing.html#aiohttp.test_utils.make_mocked_request" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/…</a></span>
