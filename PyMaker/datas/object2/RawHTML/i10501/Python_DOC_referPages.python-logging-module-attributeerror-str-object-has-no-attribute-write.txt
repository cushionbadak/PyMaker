<p>I am using Tornado, and in my app I import <code>logging</code> so I can log some information about the server.</p>
<p>I put this:</p>
<pre><code>logging.config.dictConfig(web_LOGGING)
</code></pre>
<p>right before:</p>
<pre><code>tornado.options.parse_command_line()
</code></pre>
<p>but when I run the server and click any link I get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/logging/__init__.py", line 874, in emit
    stream.write(fs % msg)
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'write'
Logged from file web.py, line 1946
</code></pre>
<p>What is causing this?</p>
<p>I've already changed to another directory to steer clear of namespace conflicts.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Psychic debugging says <code>web_LOGGING</code> has a key named <code>stream</code> with a <code>str</code> value (probably a file path); <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.basicConfig" rel="nofollow"><code>stream</code> is only for already opened files, if you want to pass a file path, it's passed as <code>filename</code></a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the definition of <code>web_LOGGING</code>? My answer is a likely problem, but you need to provide enough information to reproduce; knowing you used <code>dictConfig</code> is not super helpful when we don't know the configuration passed.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">in handlers i put "stream":"ext"#sys.stdout,i intend to put any info to sys.stdout.while for warning,i want to log into a file,like 'filename': './web_log/rotated.log'..so something wrong with stream here?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>"stream":  "ext"</code> would definitely be wrong, while <code>"stream": sys.stdout</code> should be fine. Not sure what you mean by "stream":"ext"#sys.stdout</span>
