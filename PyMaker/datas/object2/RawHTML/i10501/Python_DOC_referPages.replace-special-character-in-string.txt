<p>I have tried with something that looks like this. I thought I could just read from the file, save it's content in my own string and then use the <code>replace</code> function to alter the string.
But when I try to do the last print, noting has happened with the <code>saveData</code> string. What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>The text-file just looks like this, all is on one line:</p>
<pre><code>Today it's the ; and the time is (. I'm feeling ) and : is todays lucky number. The unlucky number of today is #

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.replace" rel="nofollow"><code>str.replace</code></a> doesn't alter the string in place, no string operations do because <em>strings are immutable</em>. It returns a copy of the replaced string which you need to assign to another name:</p>
<pre><code>replacedData = savedData.replace(";", date)
</code></pre>
<p>now your replaced string will be saved to the new name you specified in the assignment.</p>
