<p>I use Spyder, with Python 2.7, on a windows 10. I was able to install the PyPDF2 package with a conda command from my prompt. I said installation complete. Yet, If I try to run a simple import command:</p>
<p><code>import PyPDF2
</code></p>
<p>I get the error:</p>
<p><code>ImportError: No module named PyPDF2
</code></p>
<p>How can I fix this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you use python3 maybe</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install python3-pypdf2
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In my case, I was trying to import 'pyPdf2' instead of 'PyPDF2'. Observe the case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>import PyPDF2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is correct.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I had this problem too when I tried to import PyPDF2 like this:</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install python-pypdf2</code></p>
<p>When running some simple script with <code>import PyPDF2</code>, I would get an error like this:</p>
<p><code>ImportError: No module named PyPDF2</code></p>
<p>The solution was to also install pdfmerge, like this:</p>
<p><code>pip install pdfmerge</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I faced the same problem. But, In my case,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I previously installed <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python3</a> separately from official website and was using without any issues</p></li>
<li><p>Then later I installed <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Anaconda</a> package distribution software which itself has another Python3 installed in corresponding directory.  </p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, when I installed PyPDF2, it installed normally and while importing throws an error, because the base path of python3 was changed to be used with Anaconda.</p>
<p>Then I opened Anaconda prompt and installed PyPDF2 there and tried to import. <strong>It worked!!</strong></p>
<p>Then I can use it from any command prompt in my Windows PC. Or else you can delete Anaconda and everything works normally. Its just a conflict of two pythons in my pc.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Try any overlapping softwares in your PC(in my case Anaconda prompt) and try their CMD to install packages and import. If I wanted to install any package I have to go to Anaconda prompt and install it and importing that modules works anywhere without any error. So from now on wards I'm only using Anaconda prompt as my default installation prompt.</p>

<p>This is the case which I followed for python3. For python2 try with pip: </p>
<pre><code>pip install PyPDF2
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have multiple versions of Python installed on my Windows 8.1 machine (Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.7). This created problems (confusion, I should say). <strong>You must therefore be very explicit when installing packages.</strong> Ex:</p>
<pre><code>py -3.7 -m pip install PyPDF2
</code></pre>
<p>INSTEAD OF:</p>
<p><code>pip install PyPDF2</code> or <code>pip3 install PyPDF2</code></p>
<p>And <strong>to upgrade pip</strong>, use:</p>
<pre><code>py -3.7 -m pip install --upgrade pip
</code></pre>
<p>INSTEAD OF:</p>
<p><code>py -3 -m pip install --upgrade pip</code></p>
<p>Now, I can <strong>run python 3.7</strong> with <code>py -3.7</code>, and since I did <code>py -3.7 -m pip install PyPDF2</code> the <code>import PyPDF2</code> command works! Previously, since I had only done <code>pip3 install PyPDF2</code>, the <code>import PyPDF2</code> command only worked if I ran <code>py -3.5</code>, oddly enough. I think it has something to do with the fact that I installed Python 3.5 for all users, but Python 3.7 for only my user account, so the different <code>pip install</code> commands were placing the installed packages into different locations.</p>

<p>Ex:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Windows, use the py Python launcher in combination with the -m switch:</p>
<pre><code>py -2   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 2
py -2.7 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 2.7
py -3   -m pip install SomePackage  # default Python 3
py -3.4 -m pip install SomePackage  # specifically Python 3.4
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">have you tried with pip ? Like  <code>pip install PyPDF2</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">That worked. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes. python 3 matters for pypdf2.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Funny enough this simple fix worked for me.  I was importing pyPDF2 and the upper case mattered.</span>
