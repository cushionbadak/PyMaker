<p>I was trying to have a program using Python to create a "pyramid" based on a number, n, out of o's and came up with this: ( I would print nn, that would be the lines.)</p>
<pre><code>import time

n = 0
while True:
    n += 2 #just another way to show n=n+2
    nn = n, "o" #nn would be an amount of o's, based on what #n was
    time.sleep(1)
    print (nn, str.center(40, " "))
</code></pre>
<p>Not sure how to make nn the o's and not sure what line 6 does either. Does anyone know the answer to either question? ( I'm not in a class just programming for fun.)</p>
</div>

<p>You can also use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow">built-in formatting options</a> offered by python. Take a look at this:</p>
<pre><code>def pyramid_builder(height, symbol='o', padding=' '):
    for n in range(0, height, 2):  # wonkiness-correction by @mhawke
        print('{0:{1}^{2}}'.format(symbol*n, padding, height * 2))

pyramid_builder(20, 'o')
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>^</code> symbol says that you want your print <strong>centered</strong>. Before it (<code>{1}</code>) comes the padding symbol and after it (<code>{2}</code>) the total width.</p>
<p>This is fully customisable and fun to play with.</p>

<pre><code>import time

n = 0
while True:
    n += 2 #just another way to show n=n+2
    nn = "o" * n #nn would be an amount of o's, based on what #n was
    time.sleep(1)
    print (nn.center(40," "))
</code></pre>
<p>As someone has mentioned in the comments "o" * n will give a a string containing n "o"s.
I've fixed the print line to use the correct method a calling the center method.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can try this:</p>
<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
import time

for n in range(0, 40, 2):
    nn = n * "o" #nn would be an amount of o's, based on what #n was
    time.sleep(1)
    print(nn.center(40, " "))
</code></pre>

<p>This will be the answer to your question</p>
<pre><code>import time

n = 0
while True:
    n += 2
    nn = n * "o"
    time.sleep(1)
    print (nn.center(40, " "))
    if n &gt; 30:
        break
</code></pre>
<p>The reason why they have put <code>time.sleep(1)</code> is to make it look like an animation. <code>print (nn, str.center(40, " "))</code> this must be changed to <code>nn.center(40, " ")</code> as <code>.center</code> is a method of string. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Line 6 creates a tuple. Maybe you wanted <code>"o" * n</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And after you've corrected that - don't forget to put a <i>break</i> in... you've got an infinite loop right now...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matthias I almost provided OP a link to <code>sleep</code>s docs because I started counting from 0. Oh well..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matthias Ya I think that might work thanks!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It will not work because you have other strange code. What do you think <code>str.center(40, " ")</code> does?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You need to increment <code>n</code> by 2 on each iteration otherwise you'll get a wonky pyramid. e.g. <code>for n in range(2, height, 2):</code>, or if you want to start with a single <code>o</code> at the tip <code>for n in range(1, height, 2):</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks that also looks like it would work. I haven't heard about that before.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do u edit the height of each pyramid?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Cman88 by passing different arguments to the function when you call it. If it helps you understand, you can write <code>pyramid_builder(height=20, symbol='o', padding=' ')</code> instead of the last line of code above and start tweaking the values to see what you get.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, lol I just realized that str.center would b 4 strings. Thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Cman88 Welcome</span>
