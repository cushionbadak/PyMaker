<p>Just typing <code>print</code> only gives newline in python.  Typing <code>print</code> without the brackets in 3.x will also gives a newline. Why?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print">the documentation</a> says so</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)</code></p>
<p>Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end. sep, end and file, if present, must be given as keyword arguments.</p>
<p>All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end. Both sep and end must be strings; they can also be None, which means to use the default values. <strong>If no objects are given, <code>print()</code> will just write <code>end</code>.</strong></p>
<p>The file argument must be an object with a write(string) method; if it is not present or None, sys.stdout will be used. Since printed arguments are converted to text strings, print() cannot be used with binary mode file objects. For these, use file.write(...) instead.</p>
<p>Whether output is buffered is usually determined by file, but if the flush keyword argument is true, the stream is forcibly flushed.</p>
<p>Changed in version 3.3: Added the flush keyword argument.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that <code>end</code> is defaulted to <code>'\n'</code> which is a new line.</p>

<p>In Python 3, print is now a function. It will print a new line character at the end of your statement. </p>
<p>If you don't specify an "end" it will by default use a new line character. </p>
<p>You can prevent this by doing something such as:</p>
<pre><code>print("hello world", end="")
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Because the default parameter in print is \n for the end, 
though if you pass parameter for print end variable as \t or space , then you can see the same ! </p>
<p>But it works 2.7 and above!</p>

<p>It is interesting how languages differ in this.  </p>
<p><code>print</code> in the Korn shell (ksh) has the same behaviour as <code>python</code>, i.e. it adds a newline.  Bash does not have a <code>print</code>, relying on <code>echo</code> instead, which also adds a newline (which, like python, can be suppressed).</p>
<p><code>print</code> in Perl does not, and caused so much inconvenience that another version, called <code>say</code>, was added which does add a newline.  </p>
<p>Ruby and PHP are like Perl in that <code>print</code> also does not add a newline.  This of course is less of an issue when embedded in HTML.</p>
<p>If you look at other languages, for example <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HelloWorldInManyProgrammingLanguages" rel="nofollow">here</a> you will find opinion divided as to whether a newline should be added or not.  The removal of the newline in Python is discussed in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0259/" rel="nofollow">PEP259</a>.</p>
