<p>I'm having problems installing an extention on python3.5 on Windows.</p>
<p>Traced it to a <code>IF UNAME_SYSNAME == u"Windows":</code> not being triggered.
According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35887318/cannot-install-pylearn2-to-winpython-64bit-3-4-4-1/35970202#35970202">Cannot install pylearn2 to WinPython-64bit-3.4.4.1</a> adding the <code>u</code> should solve this but doesn't.</p>
<p>What is the expected output of <code>UNAME_SYSNAME</code> on Windows10 / Python 3.5?</p>
<p>sys.version = '3.5.2 |Anaconda 4.0.0 (64-bit)| (default, Jul  5 2016, 11:41:13) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]'</p>

<p>Looks like Cython doesn't really support python3.</p>
<p>If it adds support feel free to replace this answer</p>

<span class="comment-copy">If you really want that conditional to pass, can't you just replace it with <code>if True:</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kevin - yes I did, but I would like it to work for the rest of the internet !</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ah, gotcha :-) Perhaps you could find someone with Windows10 / Python 3.5 and ask them what appears when they do <code>print(UNAME_SYSNAME)</code> on the line right before the conditional.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">scripts should be changed to refer to <code>if sys.platform[:3] == 'win'</code>, instead of os.uname().sysname. BTW, it's a recommendation of python's docs: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.name" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.name</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kevin, unfortunately it's executed by Pyrex. A 'c' preprocessor which doesn't have any i/o and I can't work out how to attach a debugger</span>
