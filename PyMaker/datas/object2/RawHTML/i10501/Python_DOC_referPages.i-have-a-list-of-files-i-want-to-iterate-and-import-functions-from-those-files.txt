<p>I have a list of files, using command in python <code>from filename import *</code> , works for a single file as I am giving the exact name of the file, but if I want to use it as <code>from list[i] import *</code> to iterate over a list and importing function from files one after the another to  work on it, it doesn't work? what changes should I make so as to use it for a list of files, so that I can easily iterate?</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module" rel="nofollow">importlib</a> for that:</p>
<pre><code>from importlib import import_module

module_list = [import_module("test.mod{}".format(i)) for i in range(20)]

# OR

module_list = []
for i in range(20):
    module_list.append(import_module("test.mod{}".format(i)))

<p>As stated by the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#__import__" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>, <strong>do not use internal things such as <code>__import__</code></strong>.</p>

<p>If you're looking for dynamic imports, you're looking for the <code>__import__</code> function.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@NickA If you are going to try to justify using <code>eval</code>, then you should really think over your design approach. Also, there is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval" rel="nofollow noreferrer">literal_eval</a>. There should really never be an opportunity to justify <code>eval</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@NickA if you haven't used a language feature before, you might want to hold off on recommending it to someone until you are aware of its advantages and disadvantages. It's uninformed spouting off like this that perpetuates bad practices like the use of <code>eval</code></span>
