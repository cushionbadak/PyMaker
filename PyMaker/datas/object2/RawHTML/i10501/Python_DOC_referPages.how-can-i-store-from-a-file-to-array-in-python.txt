<p>This is one way to achieve that:</p>
<pre><code>with open('filename') as file:
  lines = [i.strip() for i in file]
</code></pre>
<p>If you want your list to contain the numbers (<strong>int</strong>) instead of strings the following code will achieve this:</p>
<pre><code>with open('seq.txt') as f:
  numbers = [int(i) for i in f]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you try this yourself at all? This is something that can be very easily found in almost any Python tutorial.

<span class="comment-copy">And searching for your question on stackoverflow leads to a lot of answers. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3277503/how-to-read-a-file-line-by-line-into-a-list-with-python">Here</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks...I was looking for it, but I was lost somehow.. I think it's beacuse of my English.. thanks for your help!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your answer is good, however, I would add this line <code>lines = [x.strip('\n') for x in lines]</code> at the end because otherwise each line in lines will contain a new line character.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks I'll update the answer to include that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No. Do not use <code>eval</code>. That is <i>very</i> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1832940/is-using-eval-in-python-a-bad-practice">bad</a> advice to give as a solution. Here is <a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">another</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay, I have change the code to use int( )</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jonas <code>f.readlines()</code> returns a list - just iterate directly over <code>file</code> instead...</span>
