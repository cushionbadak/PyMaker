<p>If the current default windows application for <code>.py</code> files is currently <code>python2</code> (i.e. <code>C:\python27\python.exe</code>) and not the new <code>py.exe</code> launcher, you can just change the default windows application for the file type.  Right-click on file -&gt; properties -&gt; click the change button for default application and change it to the python3 executable.</p>
<p>If the default application for the file is the <code>py.exe</code> windows launcher, you can add a shebang line in your scripts to force the python executable and the launcher should respect it.  Add this as the first line of your file</p>
<pre><code>#!C:\python3\python.exe
</code></pre>
<p>If you're python3 installation path is different, make sure to use that instead.</p>

<p>On <code>cmd</code> you can do <code>py -3</code> for python 3 and <code>py -2</code> for 2 but for click-starting the simplest way is to include a line <code>#! python2</code> or <code>#! python3</code>as first line in file.</p>
<p>You were on the right trach - it is mentioned in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/" rel="nofollow">PEP 397</a> in section "Shebang line parsing" </p>

<p>Assuming you have python3 installed, you can us <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/scripts.html" rel="nofollow">virtual environment mechanisms</a> built into python3 to prevent errors just like this. </p>
<p>I saw in the comments you are using Windows, so the following steps to ensure that you are using the intended version of Python every time.</p>
<p>first navigate to your projects directory and run the command:
<code>c:\Temp&gt;c:\Python35\python -m venv myenv</code>. This will create a directory <code>myenv</code> with scripts to create your virtual enviroment.</p>
<p>Next activate your virtual enviroment with the command:
<code>C:\&gt; .\myenv\Scripts\activate.bat</code>. This will change your environment to what is set in the virtual environment.   </p>
<p>Now run the command <code>python</code> to see that python 3.5 is being run.</p>
<p>to exit the virtual environment just run <code>deactivate.bat</code> </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Which OS are you using?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Windows   10. 64bit</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On cmd try: <code>python3</code> instead of <code>python</code>. The <code>-V</code> option would print the version directly like <code>python -V</code> should give <code>2.7.11</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Can you not right-click - open with python 3?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think It has something common with Python launcher for Windows:<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 397</a> @BrendanAbel</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank much. easy!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The launcher is a bit more magical than you give it credit for; the canonical Linux style shebang <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3</code> should work, or <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3.5</code> to specify a minor as well. See <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEP 397, section Shebang line parsing</a>. Using the canonical shebang line means a portable script (no OS specific features used) runs on both Windows and Linux unmodified.</span>
