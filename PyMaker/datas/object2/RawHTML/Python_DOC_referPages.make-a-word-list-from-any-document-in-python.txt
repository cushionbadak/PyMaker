<p>I am wanting to output a simple word list from any text document. I want every word listed but no duplicates. This is what I have but it doesn't do anything. I am fairly new to python. Thanks!</p>
<pre><code>def MakeWordList():
    with open('text.txt','r') as f:
        data = f.read()
    return set([word for wordd])
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>for word in data</code> loop basically iterates over <code>data</code>, which is string, so your <code>word</code> loop variable gets a single character in each iteration. You would want to use something like <code>data.split()</code> to loop over the list of words.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can't iterate over the data you read like this, because they are a string so as a result you get consecutive characters, however you can split the string on spaces, which will give you a list of words</p>
<pre><code>def MakeWordList():
    with open('possible.rtf','r') as f:
        data = f.read()
    return set([word for word in data.split(' ') if len(word) &gt;= 5 and word.islower() and not 'xx' in word])
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Hello! Welcome to StackOverflow. Seeing you're trying to read from an <code>rtf</code> file, maybe you could start by having a look at all the words that are returned, without any filtering at first; what do you get? Also, instead of <code>islower()</code>, maybe you should use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str#str.isalpha" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>isalpha()</code></a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I edited it to what I am looking for. The code I posted was an example code I was using.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But now your sample code is nonsense :-/ Please provide what you have tried so far; here it doesn't even run.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is this also applicable to <code>rtf</code> files? End of lines do not seem to be as simple as <code>\n</code> characters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@JoÃ«l I would say yes. "If the separator is not specified, any whitespace (space, newline etc.) string is a separator." <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string/split" rel="nofollow noreferrer">programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string/split</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>data.split(' ')</code> doesn't split on newline characters. You get some strange results like 'name\nand' where '\n' is the newline character.  It would seem @taras recommendation of <code>data.split()</code> would solve that issue.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It still doesn't print anything.  def MakeWordList():     with open('test.txt','r') as f:         data = f.read()     return set([word for word in data.split()])      print ()</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>print()</code> does indeed not print anything. Try <code>print(MakeWordList())</code>.</span>
