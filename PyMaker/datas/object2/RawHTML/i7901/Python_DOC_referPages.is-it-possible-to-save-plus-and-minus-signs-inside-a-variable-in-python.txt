<p>This is just a general question as I am curious. When I run the following code I get a syntax error which is understandable. However would there be a way to save the + sign in an variable so I get an answer of 4?</p>
<pre><code>SIGN = +
UNIT = 1
UNIT2 = 3
print(UNIT SIGN UNIT2)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can make a function for the <code>+</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code>def add(a, b):
    return a + b
</code></pre>
<p>and store it:</p>
<pre><code>operation = add
unit = 1
unit2 = 3

print(operation(unit, unit2))
</code></pre>
<p>Functions for operators are even <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">built into Python</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from operator import add
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You generally can't, as <code>+</code> is part of the language and not an object. You can however play around with strings and use a library like <code>sympy</code> to evaluate.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can not store arithmetic operator in the variable, however as a workaround you may store the operator as string and achieve the desired result following the answers in the linked questions</span>
<span class="comment-copy">if it is a home-work exercise, one may also use <code>eval</code> here. For example: <code>eval('1 + 3')</code></span>
