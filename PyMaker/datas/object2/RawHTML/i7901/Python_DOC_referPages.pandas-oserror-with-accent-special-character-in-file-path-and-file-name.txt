<p>I am trying to use <code>pandas.read_csv</code> to get data from some .csv files. This works fine as long as there is no accent (e.g. ä,é,ü) in the file name or file path. As soon as I use a file name such as <code>düm1.csv</code>I get the following error: <code>OSError: Initializing from file failed</code>. My code is:</p>
<p><code>dum1 = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\MyName\Desktop\dumm12\düm1.csv", sep = ";", decimal = ",", encoding = "utf-8")</code></p>
<p>I am using pandas 0.20.1 and python 3.6.0. I have found that this has been an issue in previous versions but I thought it had been resolved. Any ideas on how to fix this? I also found this:

<p>I had a similar problem. It's look like the problem occurs with pandas.read_csv with Python 3.6 in a Windows system.</p>
<p>Python 3.6 change Windows filesystem encoding from "mbcs" to "UTF-8". See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-529-change-windows-filesystem-encoding-to-utf-8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python PEP 529</a>. You can use the command <code>sys.getfilesystemencoding()</code> to get the current file system encoding</p>
<p>I get two solutions around this:</p>
<p>1.- Use this code to change all the app to works with the prior Python &lt;= 3.5 encoding ("mbcs")</p>
<pre><code>import sys
sys._enablelegacywindowsfsencoding()
</code></pre>
<p>2.- Pass a file pointer to the pandas.read_csv</p>
<pre><code>with open("C:\Users\MyName\Desktop\dumm12\düm1.csv", 'r') as fp:
        dum1 = pd.read_csv(fp, sep = ";", decimal = ",", encoding = "utf-8")
</code></pre>
<p>You can see this post: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46140297/pandas-read-csv-cant-import-file-with-accent-mark-in-path">pandas.read_csv can't import file with accent mark in path</a></p>

<p>I tested the name in creating a fake file 'düm1.csv'. </p>
<p>when I run : </p>
<pre><code>df = pd.read_csv('düm1.csv',sep=';')

<p>I haven't an OSError and the file is open in my Ipython. </p>

<p>Have you tried without encoding ? Without accent ? </p>
<p>C. </p>

<p>The  <a href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15086" rel="nofollow noreferrer">issue</a> hasn't been resolved till now. Wait till a PR. Or try it with Python 2.7 I guess that might work</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I can reproduce this error with Python 3.6.1, Pandas 0.20.1; however I did not have it until yesterday while working with Python 3.4.4 and Pandas 0.18.1.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is weird. Might it be a bug in new versions and I should downgrade?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, it is weird that it works for you. I have tried without encoding but it does not work either. However, it works without accents. Any other ideas? Thank you for testing, this way I know it is not a general issue but rather related to my code, machine or package version.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welcome. I'm using python 3.6.1 and ipython 5.3.0. You can try with encoding='ISO-8859-1'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried with the encoding ISO-8859-1 but it did not work either. I will update python and ipython and hope it does help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried with update python and ipython. It does not work with accents. It seems I have to live with the status quo.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Maybe it's depending of the language of your computer. I don't know, but if it you change the name and it's work finally you can use your data, the problem don't arise from your data or pandas. Good luck !</span>
