<p>My program is to iterate through coordinates(list) and check to see if 3 coordinates come out True from the ocoords(list) and return or possibly get that False value(coordinate)</p>
<p>I'm trying to find an efficient way of finding similar values in two lists that are structured differently but have the same coordinates.</p>
<pre><code>coordinates = [[(2,2),(3,2)],[(2,2),(2,3)],[(4,2),(5,2)],[(5,2),(6,2)]]


#iterating through coordinates...
&gt;&gt;&gt;
[(2, 2), (3, 2)]
[(2, 2), (2 ,3)]
[(4, 2), (5, 2)]
[(5, 2), (6, 2)]
</code></pre>
<p>Then my next list is structured like this (with specified coordinates that should go together...</p>
<pre><code>ocoords = [[[(2,2),(3,2)],[(2,2),(2,3)],[(4,2),(5,2)],[(3,3),(3,2)]], &lt;-- last value is not identical
 [[(3,2),(4,2)],[(3,2),(3,3)],[(3,3),(4,3)],[(4,3),(4,2)]]] &lt;-- structure of list
</code></pre>
<p>So how would you go about this? I'm novice to this, so sorry for the question. I thought of using Boolean, but then I need to get that value that is False.</p>
<p>I want to see if any of the coordinates are in ocoords [0] and if they are, but one isn't give me that value.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.dropwhile" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>itertools.dropwhile</code></a> with a <em>predicate</em> that checks for items in <code>coordinates</code> that are also contained in <code>ocoords[0]</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import dropwhile

val = next(dropwhile(lambda x: x in ocoords[0], coordinates))
print(val)
# [(5, 2), (6, 2)]
</code></pre>
<p>If the items are aligned, you can go faster with <code>zip</code> and not having to check for the containment of each item, rather check until there is a pair-wise mismatch:</p>
<pre><code>val = next(dropwhile(lambda x: x[0]==x[1], zip(coordinates, ocoords[0])))
print(val[0])  
# [(5, 2), (6, 2)]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It isn't very clear what the returned value would be. And the description of <code>ocoords</code>' structure is also not clear.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I want to see if any of the coordinates are in ocoords [0] and if they are, but one isn't give me that value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should add that as part of the question. BTW, Is the order of the items always aligned as in your example or it could be arbitrary?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could easily <code>zip</code> the items and compare pair-wise until the condition fails if the items were aligned. If they are not, it will be a different approach altogether.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you I will give this a try</span>
