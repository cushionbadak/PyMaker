<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was trying to understand what does this module threading I have seen this code and I didn't know what this line <code>t = threading.Thread(target=worker)</code> is supposed to mean. Please any one can help me?</p>
<p>How can this threading help?</p>
<pre><code>import threading

def worker():        
    print 'Worker'
    return

threads = []
for i in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>That means the threading target is 'worker' function.</p>
<p>Here is another example.</p>
<pre><code>import threading

def example(argv_0):
    print argv_0


th = threading.Thread(target=example, args=('hi',))
th.start()
th.join()
</code></pre>
<p>This means that the thread target is example with an argument 'hi'.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">thank you sir but i need to know if there is a way to avoid using this module on a script like this</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Creates a <code>Thread</code> object referred to by the name <code>t</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can't we just call the function on the for loop with out using the threading because i have the same resulte when i call the Worker() func on the for loop</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You ask if you can avoid using <code>threading</code>:  this is such a trivial example that there is very little point in using it.   Where does the code come from, why are you using it, and why don't you want to use <code>threading</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you sir for your answer i think i have to read more about this module</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should have done that before asking here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">sorry sir you are right next this mistake will not being repeated</span>
