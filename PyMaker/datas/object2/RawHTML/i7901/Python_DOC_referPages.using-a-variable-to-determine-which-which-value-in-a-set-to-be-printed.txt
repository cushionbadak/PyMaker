<p>I'm looking for a bit of help on a piece of python code I've been writing for fun, the troublesome piece of code is thus:</p>
<pre><code>v = randint(1,7)
if v != 7:
    d = randint(1,5)
    if d == 1:
        print(vdset[v], file=text_file)
</code></pre>
<p>My aim is to use randint to select a random value from my set, however, when running I get the error that <code>'set' object does not support indexing</code>. I suppose then that I need to replace my use of <code>set</code> with something else, but I am unsure as to what would work.</p>

<p>The problem is that a set is an unordered collections of unique element. You should have a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">data structure</a> for Python : </p>
<p>You can try :</p>
<pre><code>v = randint(1,7)
    if v != 7:
        d = randint(1,5)
        if d == 1:
            print(list(vdset)[v], file=text_file)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>random.choice</code></a>. This has the same problem where a set doesn't support indexing but you can simply convert the set to a list (which does support indexing).</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from random import choice
&gt;&gt;&gt; my_set = {1, 3, 2, 7, 5, 4}
&gt;&gt;&gt; choice(my_set)
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing
&gt;&gt;&gt; choice(list(my_set))

<span class="comment-copy">sets are not ordered, so they can't be indexed. You can use a list instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Picking a random element from a sequence is best done using <code>random.choice()</code>, by the way. You'd still need a list or tuple however.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You could <code>list(vdset)[v]</code> if you're really wed to `vdset``</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@ShawnMehan: at which point the order is going to greatly depend on the insertion and deletion history. But for random selection that may not be too bad.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using list(vdset)[v] or just changing my original set to list gives me a new error; "I/O operation on a closed file."</span>
