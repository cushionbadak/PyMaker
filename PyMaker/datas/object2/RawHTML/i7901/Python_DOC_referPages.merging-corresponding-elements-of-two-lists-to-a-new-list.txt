<p>I have two lists as shown below,car_xy and car_id. I have wrote a sample code to merge the corresponding elements of both lists, but am not getting the desired output.</p>
<pre><code>car_xy =[(650,700),(568,231),(789,123),(968,369)]
car_id =[284,12,466,89]
#required_details merges the two lists
required_details = list(set(car_xy+car_id))
#now if i do print required_details the ouput will be a list like;
required_details = [284,12,(650,700),89,(568,231),466,(968,369),(789,123)] 
#the required details adds the information in list randomly. What if i want  the first elements of both the list together, like
required_details = [[284,(650,700)],[12,(568,231),[466,(789,123)],[89,(968,369)]]
</code></pre>
<p>Any suggestions will be great.</p>

<p>Actually you need <code>[list(pair) for pair in zip(car_id, car_xy)]</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Assuming that the arrays are same length, you loop through them and combine them like this:</p>
<pre><code>required_details = []
for i in range(len(car_xy)):
    required_details.append([car_id[i], car_xy[i]])
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>you are searching for the <code>zip</code> function. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip</a></p>
<pre><code>car_xy =[(650,700),(568,231),(789,123),(968,369)]
car_id =[284,12,466,89]
required_details = zip(car_id,car_xy)
</code></pre>
<p>Edit:
adding the following makes it a list, in case there is a need for mutation.</p>
<pre><code>req_details_list = [list(pair) for pair in required_details]
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'push'</code> (py2.7)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AyushShanker ah yeah it's actually .append() in python fixed the answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Quartal its giving a Type error:can only concatenate tuple (not '''int') to tuple</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the corresponding elements are not listed together in this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">added list creation in case this is really needed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you for the comments.</span>
