<p>First and foremost, you could have found this info in any tutorial, book, or question searched on here. Anyways....</p>
<p>Input takes the text which will be displayed to the user when prompted in the console.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; input("Enter a number: ")
Enter a number:
</code></pre>
<p>Then, I could type in the number I wanted and hit enter. (Reverting to previous line)</p>
<pre><code>Enter a number: 4
</code></pre>
<p>Then, the value you assigned input to would have "4". Note that this is a string.</p>
<p>Hence, <code>int(input(1))</code> isn't doing what you think it is. Your program is still "running" because it's waiting for user input.</p>
<pre><code>x=int(input("Enter first number: "))
y=int(input("Enter second number: "))

if x==y:
    print('x and y are equal')
else:
    print('x and y are not equal')
print('thanks')
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Enter first number: 1
Enter second number: 1
x and y are equal
thanks
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It keeps running because x and y are inputs. Inputs ask you to type in something to give them a value. Remove the input(...). Also, int() is unnecessary because 1 and 2 are already integers.</p>
<pre><code>x = 1
y = 2
if x == y:
    print("x and y are equal")
else:
    print("x and y are not equal")
print("thanks")

<p><strong>Hello Mr. Nitesh,</strong> </p>
<p>Your program is not wrong when you execute your program also get output but programming or standard way is not valid your program.  </p>
<p>If you ar beginner in python first read the basic programming in deep and read programming standard. I give below website for python... 
1) <a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/contributing/python.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/contributing/python.html</a> (Python Programming Standard)<br/>

3) <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/</a> (Python Learning)  </p>
<p><strong>I give your question of answer is below,</strong> </p>
<pre><code>x = int(input("Enter the value of x: "))
y = int(input("Enter the value of Y: "))

print "Now check both are equal or not..."

if x != y:
   print('x and y are not equal.')
elif x == y :`enter code here`
   print('x and y are equal')

print('Thank you.')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Looks like the error doesn't come from program itself, there is nothing wrong with it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">do you really want to use the numbers <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> as your input prompts? otherwise the program seems to work</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nice. i am new in python i learn all website give by you.</span>
