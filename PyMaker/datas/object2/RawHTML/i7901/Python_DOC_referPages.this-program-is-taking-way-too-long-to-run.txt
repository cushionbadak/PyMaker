<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This code is taking a really long time to run.</p>
<p>It is meant to find the most common word in a text file.</p>
<p>It is in Python 3.5.1.</p>
<p>The Code:</p>
<pre><code>cTR = []
cTRC = []


file = open("fileToCompress3.txt","r")
analysis = file.read().split(' ')
file.close()


##### Most Common Word #####
print(1)

for i in range(len(analysis)):

    if analysis[i] not in cTR:
        cTR.extend([analysis[i]])
        cTRC.extend([1])

    elif analysis[i] in cTR:

        for j in range(len(cTR)):

            if cTR[j] == analysis[i]:

                use = j
                break

        cTRC[use] = cTRC[use] + 1

<p>Thank You and I really appreciate any help!</p>

<p>Yep, that’s a really inefficient way to do that – ϴ(n²) time. Python has <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a built-in counter type</a> that does ϴ(n) comparisons:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

with open("fileToCompress3.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    words = f.read().split()

word_counts = Counter(words)

print(word_counts.most_common(1))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank You for your answer, but how can you separate the word from the count as right now it prints like     &gt;&gt;&gt; [('the', 46), ('of', 33), ('\\', 33), ('and', 31), ('to', 25)]</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can use <code>zip()</code> to split them: <code>cTR, cTRC = zip(*word_counts.most_common())</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TheEngineer: What do you want the result to look like? They’re tuples, so the single most common word would be <code>word_counts.most_common(1)[0][0]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Counter performs n log n comparisons. Look ar the source: <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/collections/__init__.py" rel="nofollow noreferrer">github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/collections/…</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@enedil: Which part of the source?</span>
