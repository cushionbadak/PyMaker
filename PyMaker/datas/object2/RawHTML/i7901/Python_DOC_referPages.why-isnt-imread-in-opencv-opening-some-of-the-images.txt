<p>The relevant code is this:</p>
<pre><code>import cv2
import numpy as np

img = cv2.imread('C:\Users\harit\Desktop\images\12.jpg')

cv2.imshow('img',img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Try changing</p>
<pre><code>img = cv2.imread('C:\Users\harit\Desktop\images\12.jpg')
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>img = cv2.imread(r'C:\Users\harit\Desktop\images\12.jpg')
</code></pre>
<p>Backslash is an escape character, and the r before the quotes tells python to "ignore" them.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'C:\Users\harit\Desktop\images\12.jpg'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print s
C:\Users\harit\Desktop\images
.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>This is the wrong path!... with an 'r' in front of the string:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = r'C:\Users\harit\Desktop\images\12.jpg'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print s
C:\Users\harit\Desktop\images\12.jpg
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Check those images. Are they well-formed images? It seems a full dimension is missing or, and that depends on opencv, some error like this appears when there is a problem opening a file? You probably should check img before imshow.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do i exactly check those images (sorry i am new to openCV and python). I am downloading those images from google. Some of the pictures do open while some of them don't. I have tried opening both the extensions (.png &amp; .jpg).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just open them in some image-viewer. And check img before imshow. It might be even wise to check if a file is existing before opening, throwing something useful if not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The images do exist and they are opening just fine.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Existing (i see them in my folder) and existing/loadable from python's perspective are two different things. And yet, you did not check img before imshow. Take your time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much! adding 'r' in front of the string really worked! It works even when double backlash is added instead of adding 'r' in front of the string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No problem! If this worked for you would you mind marking my answer as accepted? Thanks!</span>
