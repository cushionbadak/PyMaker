<p>I'm <em>somewhat</em> new to Python, but I have enough under my belt to know what I'm doing. What I'm trying to do is write a few lines for a .txt file (as well as a variable), and then print 5 of those characters.</p>
<pre><code>import os
username = "Chad_Wigglybutt"
file = open("testfile.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello .txt file, ")
file.write("This is a test, ")
file.write("Can this write variables? ")
file.write("Lets see: ")
file.write(username)
file.close()
</code></pre>
<p>It then creates the file without issue, but when I add </p>
<pre><code>print file.read(5)
</code></pre>
<p>to the code, it gives me a syntax error for file.read, and I have no clue why. I've been on the internet for a few hours now and I can't find anything. Either I'm extremely bad at google searching and I'm an idiot, or something's broken, or both. Any tips/ideas? :/</p>

<p>You're writing Python 3 code. In Python 3, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print</code> is a function</a>, not a special statement. You need parentheses for function calls:</p>
<pre><code>print(file.read(5))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">@StephenRauch: Perhaps, but the <code>SyntaxError</code> wouldn't come from failing to open the file. I'm assuming there is omitted code, which I'm not going to attempt to psychically debug.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">python3 is usually good about producing a "you needed parens to call print" error, but if there are other parentheses in the line it gives up and gives a blank <code>SyntaxError:</code> (such as this case).</span>
