<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am a just starting with coding and I am trying to solve a challenge. The challenge is to write a function that when given an key value pair with a title and url, the function will print a linked title.</p>
<p>If the title is longer than 50 characters, truncate the title to 50 characters followed by 3 ellipses.</p>
<p>I am trying to do this in Python. Below is what I have so far. I realize the last part is just floating there. I wasn't sure where to put it though.</p>
<p>I was trying to create a class that I could add the key-value pair to as i will have to add more in the next challenge.</p>
<pre><code>class Webpage(object):
    def __init__(self, title, link):
        self.title = title
        self.link = link
    ex1 = ('really, really, really long title that will be chopped off', 'example.com')
        print Webpage.ex1

title = (title[:50] + '..' if len(title) &gt; 50 else title)
</code></pre>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>
</div>

<p>My intuition is that all you want is something simple, like this.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class Webpage(object):
...     def __init__(self, title, link):
...         self.title = title
...         self.link = link
...     def print_title(self):
...         print (self.title[:50] + '..' if len(self.title)&gt;50 else self.title)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; webpage_1 = Webpage('little title', 'http://www.somewhere.org')
&gt;&gt;&gt; webpage_1.print_title()
little title
&gt;&gt;&gt; webpage_2 = Webpage('big title' + 50*'-', 'http://www.somewhere.org')
&gt;&gt;&gt; webpage_2.print_title()
big title-----------------------------------------..
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You might want to create a different variable for the displayed truncated title and then use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>@property</code></a> to return the property attribute. </p>
<pre><code>class Webpage(object):
    def __init__(self, title, link):
        self.title = title
        self.link = link
        self._truncated_title = (self.title[:50] + '..' if len(self.title) &gt; 50 else self.title)
    @property
    def print_title(self):
        """returns the truncated title"""
        return self._truncated_title
example = Webpage('really, really, really long title that will be chopped off', 'example.com')
print(example.print_title)
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The code you've written should work, you just need to put it into a class method. Then it should use <code>self.title</code> to get the title from the class.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">so is your question how to retrieve the webpage?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Matti Lyra The output should be the link and the truncated title. But when I run it I get a "command not found" error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Barmar How would I put it in a class method?</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>def print_title(self):</code> followed by the code to print the title. Any tutorial on writing classes in Python should explain this.</span>
