<p>I want to strip the substring <code>'_pf'</code> from a list of strings. It is working for most of them, but not where there is a <code>p</code> in the part of the string I want to remain.  e.g. </p>
<pre><code>In: x = 'tcp_pf'
In: x.strip('_pf')
Out: 
'tc'
</code></pre>
<p>I would expect the sequence above to give an output of <code>'tcp'</code></p>
<p>Why doesn't it? Have i misunderstood the <code>strip</code> function?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can use:</p>
<pre><code>x = 'tcp_ip'
x.split('_ip')[0]
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>'tcp'
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can also use spilt function like below,</p>
<p>x.split('_pf')[0]</p>
<p>It will give you tcp.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Carefully read the manual for the <code>strip</code> method: "If given and not None, chars must be a string; the characters in the string will be stripped from the both ends of the string this method is called on"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you tried consulting the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs</a>? "The chars argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">OK, I thought it would only strip the whole substring passed to it, rather than any of the characters within it. Is there an alternative function that does what I am trtying to do?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're right @Peter  it's a duplicate. I should have looked harder. Should I delete it?</span>
