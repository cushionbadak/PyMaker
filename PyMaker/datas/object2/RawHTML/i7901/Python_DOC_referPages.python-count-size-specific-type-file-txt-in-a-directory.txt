<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In my folder, there are two types of files: <code>html</code> and <code>txt</code>. 
I want to know the total size of the <code>txt</code> files.</p>
<p>I found this code, but how do I apply it for my needs?</p>
<pre><code>import os
from os.path import join, getsize
size = 0
count = 0
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
    size += sum(getsize(join(root, name)) for name in files)
    count += len(files)
print count, size
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can qualify which files by adding an <code>if</code> to the comprehensions like:</p>
<pre><code>for root, dirs, files in os.walk(path):
    size += sum(getsize(join(root, name)) for name in files if name.endswith('.txt'))
    count += sum(1 for name in files if name.endswith('.txt'))
print count, size
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>better use glob (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html</a>) instead of os to find your files. that makes it imho more readable.</p>
<pre><code>import glob
import os

path = '/tmp'
files = glob.glob(path + "/**/*.txt")
total_size = 0
for file in files:
    total_size += os.path.getsize(os.path.join(path, file))
print len(files), total_size
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">For name in files if name in '.txt' - add this at the end. But os path also has a native command, ehich I cannot recall. I can have a look when I'm at computer .)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">.endswith is what you need :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">works for the size, but your third line shows red line on "name": unresolved reference name. NameError: global name 'name' is not defined. Do I need to make name='' ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok, it was 1 for _ in files. I replaced _ as name. Then works, thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This also works</span>
