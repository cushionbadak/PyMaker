<p>I am developing a small project using Python 3.6 version. Implementing the unit test with unittest I have an error executing <code>python3 -m unittest</code> and I have not an error executing <code>python -m unittest</code>.</p>
<p>The error shows import error like:</p>
<pre><code>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'genome'
</code></pre>
<p>Is there any import problem using unittest in Python 3.6?</p>
</div>

<p>You probably call two different versions of Python, that do not have the same packages installed.</p>
<p>It seems that <code>genome</code> is not installed with <code>python3</code>. If <code>genome</code> is an Internet installed package, you can fix this with</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m pip install genome
</code></pre>

<p>It's difficult to answer without you showing your code, but to add to Guillaume's answer, the syntax for relative imports is different between python2 and python3</p>
<p>In python3, The only acceptable syntax for relative imports is <code>from .[module] import name</code>. All import forms not starting with . are interpreted as absolute imports.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">(PEP 0328)</a> for more information</p>

<span class="comment-copy">How this gonna solve the error mentionned previously?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I read that links previously, and others, like saul comment. I do not understand the problem. As I posted yesterday <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44315077/import-error-running-unittest-in-python3">here</a>, from .module import * must work, but It does not work. I guess it's a subtle mistake.</span>
