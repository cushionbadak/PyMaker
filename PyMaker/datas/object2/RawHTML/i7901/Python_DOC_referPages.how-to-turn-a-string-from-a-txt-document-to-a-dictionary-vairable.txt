<p>It looks like you have a typo at the beginning of your dict definition. 
The correct syntax should be: <code>h = '{"1":{"Name":"Teddies","Amount":6,"PPU":int(6),"CPU":int(4)},2:{"Name":"WoodenToys","Amount":0,"PPU":int(15) * int(1),"CPU": int(10)}}'</code></p>
<p>You can use the <code>eval()</code> function for this, but beware cause it's not safe and hence not recommended. </p>
<p>Check out the <code>literal_eval()</code> function from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ast</a> module instead. </p>
<p>You will have to lose the <code>int()</code> parsing or do it somehow before...</p>

<span class="comment-copy">That's not valid JSON, so obviously <code>json.loads</code> isn't going to work. It's not valid python either, so something like <code>eval</code> isn't going to work either. Does your string really look like that?</span>
