<p>I am using concurrent.futures to multithread an app I am writing.</p>
<p>I start the app by importing IPAddress from netaddr:</p>
<pre><code>from netaddr import IPNetwork, IPAddress
</code></pre>
<p>Next, I take some input files and I pass them all into my function being multithreaded:</p>
<pre><code>with open(options.filename) as f:
    contents = f.readlines()
    executor = concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(threads)
    futures = [executor.submit(ip_compare, ip, scope_list) for ip in contents]
</code></pre>
<p>Then I wait get the results as completed and append them to an output var:</p>
<pre><code>for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
    output.append(future.results()
</code></pre>
<p>The issue I have is that I keep getting the excetion from future:</p>
<pre><code>global name 'IPAddress' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the ip_compare function:</p>
<pre><code>def ip_compare(ip_addr, scope_list):
    ip_addr = ip_addr.rstrip()
    if not is_ipv4(ip_addr):
        try:
            ip = socket.gethostbyname(ip_addr)
        except:
            return "error," + ip_addr + ",,," + str(sys.exc_info()[0]).replace(',',';') + "\r\n"
    else:
        ip = ip_addr
    for scope in scope_list:
        if IPAddress(ip) in IPNetwork(scope):
            return "in," + ip_addr + "," + ip + "," + scope + ",\r\n"
    return "out," + ip_addr + "," + ip + "," + ",,\r\n"
</code></pre>
<p>Any idea why futures is not recognizing the loaded module?</p>
<p>When my IDE stops the execution of the script because of the error, I can clearly see that IPAddress is defined in the memory:</p>
<pre><code>IPAddress = {type} &lt;class 'netaddr.ip.IPAddress'&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Ok so the issue was that I was importing netaddr from within main:</p>
<pre><code>if __name__=="__main__":
try:
    from netaddr import IPNetwork, IPAddress
except ImportError as error:
    print "Please install netaddr.\r\npip install netaddr\r\n\r\nIf pip is not installed, install pip\r\nhttps://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html"
</code></pre>
<p>I moved this to the top of the script and everything worked fine. I am curious as to why this worked though, if anyone can answer that.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Per <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#processpoolexecutor" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>, <i>"The <code>__main__</code> module must be importable by worker subprocesses. This means that ProcessPoolExecutor will not work in the interactive interpreter."</i> This implies each worker subprocess imports the <code>__main__</code> module. Thus globals outside <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code> get defined. Those inside the <code>if-statement</code> are not executed.</span>
