<p>I am learning python and going through their tutorials. I understand list comprehensions and nested lists comprehensions. With the following code, though, I am trying to understand the order of events.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; matrix = [
...[1, 2, 3, 4],
...[5, 6, 7, 8],
...[9, 10, 11, 12],
... ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(4)]
[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4,8,12]]
</code></pre>
<p>According to the nested list comprehension, is the first "i" and the second "i" the same variable and do they both increase at the same time? I guess I don't understand how the resulting big list goes from the first sublist [1, 5, 9] to the second sublist [2, 6, 10]</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>[[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(4)]
</code></pre>
<p>is equivalent to</p>
<pre><code>my_list = []
for i in range(4):
    my_list_2 = []
    for row in matrix:
        my_list_2.append(row[i])
    my_list.append(my_list_2)
</code></pre>
<p><br/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>is the first "i" and the second "i" the same variable and do they both increase at the same time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, it is. If it was not the same <code>i</code>, the code would throw an error because one of the two would not be defined.</p>
