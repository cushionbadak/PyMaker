<p>I have some python script name abc.py, but when I execute it, I want to run with some different name, say "def".</p>
<p>Is it possible in python without installing any additional module (procname)?</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why cannot you just rename the file and run? A more detailed requirement would be required :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Using procname is the correct answer. Why don't you want to use this module?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Kay: This module doesn't come with default python package. This module has to be additionally installed on machine, which cant be done due to some permission reasons.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I had a look at the source for the module. It's using system calls in c - which I'm guessing is the only way to get the behaviour you want.</span>
