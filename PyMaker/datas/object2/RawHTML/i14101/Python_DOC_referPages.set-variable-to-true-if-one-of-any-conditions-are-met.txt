<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am checking for a long list of conditions, where each one looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>s = "string"
match = False

if "x" in s:
   variable = "something"
if "y" in s:
   variable = "something else"
if "z" in s:
   variable = "something something"
</code></pre>
<p>If any one of these are met, I want to set <code>match = True</code>.
Otherwise keep it at <code>match = False</code>.</p>
<p>I don't want to include <code>match = True</code> in each <code>if</code> statement because that would clutter up the code.</p>
<p>Is there a way to simply group all of these together, and if any condition is fulfilled, set <code>match = True</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Initialize match with true and change it to false in else statement</p>
<pre><code>s = "string"
match = True

if "z" in s:
   variable = "something something"
elif "y" in s:
   variable = "something else"
elif "x" in s:
   variable = "something"
else:
   match=False
</code></pre>
<p>Since in some case your all cases can be true so change the sequence of if statement to convert it to <code>elif</code> with still the same logic</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is the simple hack for your problem 
list the tuples with conditions and check that weather True is in or not 
and do accordingly 
ex :
a = 1,2,3,4
conditions = (1 in a,5 in a,3 in a.....)//here the coditions holds series<br/>
                                          of  True or False values<br/>
                                           then check 
match = true if True in conditions</p>

<span class="comment-copy">2 ideas: Do you know <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>any</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>set</code></a>? You could do a set intersection and see if it is empty or not.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@falsetru There is no initial value for <code>variable</code>, it is set only if a condition is met.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>match = 'variable' in vars()</code>  OR  <code>match = variable != 'initial value'</code> if the <code>variable</code> has an initial value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Btw is it possible to use <code>or</code> with <code>elif</code> as: <code>elif "x" in s or "y" in s:</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Winterflags yeah it is , why don't you try that</span>
