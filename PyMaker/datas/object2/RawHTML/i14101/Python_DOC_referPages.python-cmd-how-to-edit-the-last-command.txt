<p>I am working on a small command line application based on the Cmd Python module. I can't see how to show the last command in the console prompt so that it can be edited by the user and re-submitted. </p>
<p><strong>The question is not about how to store the last command. It is about how to shows it in the prompt and allow the user to edit it</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/cmd.html" rel="nofollow">From the docs for cmd</a>, <code>Cmd</code> has a parameter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cmd.use_rawinput A flag, defaulting to true. If true, cmdloop() uses
  raw_input() to display a prompt and read the next command; if false,
  sys.stdout.write() and sys.stdin.readline() are used. (This means that
  by importing readline, on systems that support it, the interpreter
  will automatically support Emacs-like line editing and command-history
  keystrokes.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I.e., you can use the up arrow to bring up the last command:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import cmd
&gt;&gt;&gt; C = cmd.Cmd()
&gt;&gt;&gt; C.cmdloop()
(Cmd) command1
*** Unknown syntax: command1
(Cmd) command1
</code></pre>
<p>In the final line above, I pressed the up arrow and it remembered my last command.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Just use readline library. You can find example in python doc:

<span class="comment-copy">I think you did not get the question, see the Cmd module</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The <code>cmd</code> module does not support something like this. You will have to build your own console interpreter for this, or use something like ncurses.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">why is everyone voting this question down so much, I think it's an OK question?</span>
