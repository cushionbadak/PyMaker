<p>I have a file that has an obnoxious preface to the header. So it looks like this:</p>

Tab Separated Header Names That I Want To Use
</code></pre>
<p>I want to  skip past everything and use the tab sep header names for my code. This is what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>reader = csv.DictReader(CSVFile)
for i in range(14): #trying to skip the first 14 rows
    reader.next()
for row in reader:
    print(row)
    if args.nextCode:
        tab = (row["Tab"])
        sep = int((row["Separated"]))
</code></pre>
<p>This code gets this error:</p>
<pre><code>File "/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.5/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/csv.py", line 104, in next
    row = self.reader.next()
StopIteration
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to print the rows, to see where I was in the file, and I changed the "range(14)" to range 5, but when I print the row, I get this:</p>
<pre><code>{'Review performed by:': 'Tab/tSeparated/tHeader/tNames/tThat/tI/tWant/tTo/tUse'}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "program.py", line 396, in &lt;module&gt;
    main()
  File "program.py", line 234, in main
    tab = (row["Tab"])
KeyError: 'Tab'
</code></pre>
<p>So I am not really sure the right way to skip those top lines. Any help would be appreciated. </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>A <code>csv.DictReader</code> reads the first line from the file <em>when it's instantiated</em>, to get the headers for subsequent rows. Therefore it uses <code>Review performed by:</code> as the header row, <em>then</em> you skip the next 14 rows.</p>
<p>Instead, skip the rows <em>before</em> creating the <code>DictReader</code>:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(14):
    CSVFile.next()
reader = csv.DictReader(CSVFile)
...
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could wrap the <code>CSVFile</code> with an <code>itertools.islice</code> iterator object to slice-off the lines of the preface when creating the <code>DictReader</code>, instead of the providing it directly to the constructor. </p>
<p>This works because the <code>csv.reader</code> constructor will accept any "object which supports the <em>iterator</em> protocol and returns a string each time its <code>next()</code> method is called" according to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html?highlight=csv.reader#csv.reader" rel="nofollow">csv docs</a>. This also applies to <code>csv.DictReader</code>s because they use an underlying <code>reader</code> instance internally.</p>
<pre><code>N = 14  # number of lines to skip
for row in csv.DictReader(itertools.islice(CSVFile, N, None)):
    process row ...

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks so much. I didn't realize that it was when it was instantiated. Very informative!</span>
