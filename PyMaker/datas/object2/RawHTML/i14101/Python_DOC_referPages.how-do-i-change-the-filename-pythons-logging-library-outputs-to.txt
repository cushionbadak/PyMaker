<p>I am using a <code>TimedRotatingFileHandler</code> for my Python project for logging. However, when it's time for a rollover, it changes my base file name from <code>baseName.log</code> to <code>baseName.log.(TimeStamp)</code>, what can I do so it instead looks like <code>baseName.(TimeStamp).log</code>.</p>
<p>That way who ever is using it doesn't have to configure what program to use each time it try to open it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this feature is not present in <code>logging</code>. However, you can very easily use the message formatting of this library to output a time stamp of each message logged in your file. Afterwards, a very simple python script could allow you to break down the files into two for all timestamps greater to whatever you want.</p>
<pre><code>FORMAT = '%(asctime)- %(message)s'
logging.basicConfig(format=FORMAT)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">The default implementation doesn't let you configure this, no. You'd have to create your own subclass, and it doesn't look all that trivial, to be honest.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Indeed, it's as Martijn says. On Python 3.3 and later, you can do this more easily: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler.namer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/â€¦</a></span>
