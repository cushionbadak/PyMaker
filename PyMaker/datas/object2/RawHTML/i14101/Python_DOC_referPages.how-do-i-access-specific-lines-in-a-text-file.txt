<p>How do I access specific lines (ie #10-#20) in a text file? I tried <code>for iteration in range(10,20):</code> but it doesn't work.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can do this with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html?#itertools.islice" rel="nofollow"><code>itertools.islice</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>import itertools

with open('test.txt', 'rt') as file:
    lines = list(itertools.islice(file, 10-1, 20))
</code></pre>
<p>Whether you should use <code>10</code> or <code>10-1</code> for the first argument to <code>islice()</code> depends on whether you consider the first line of a file line 0, or line 1. Also note that the strings in <code>lines</code> will each end with a newline character.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think this is what you want</p>
<pre><code>f = open('file.txt','r')
all_lines = f.readlines()
required_lines = [all_lines[i] for i in range(10,21)]
</code></pre>
<p><code>required_lines</code> will now contain lines from line#10 to line#20</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">show the code of your iteration and its output</span>
<span class="comment-copy">your question is about line, but you tried to get range! so what is the actual problem?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One of these days I'll get in the habit of using <code>with</code> blocks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is actually better than the accepted answer to the duplicate question, although <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/27108718/355230">one of the others</a> says essentially the same thing.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@martineau Aw, thanks! :) Yeah, I was flipping through the top answers to the dupe, and I was surprised that none of them suggested islice.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes it is, especially since <code>itertools.islice()</code> has been around since version Python v2.3.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note that this will read the whole file; for large files, if you only want ten lines, that's somewhat inefficient.</span>
