<p>I worked with Blender 2.49 and in my script I used <code>from Blender import *</code>. But now I'm upgrading my code to Blender 2.74 and when I run appears this error <em>No module named Blender</em>. There have been changes to call Blender module in version 2.74?</p>

<p>From 2.50 blender started using python 3.x and the python api was completely changed. From 2.63 bmesh (supporting n-gons) was added which changed the way mesh editing was done.</p>
<p>You may want to start with some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python 2 to 3 docs</a> as some parts of your script may need changes to work in python 3.x.</p>
<p>You can find the new <a href="http://www.blender.org/documentation/250PythonDoc/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">api reference online</a> and I would suggest you start with the quickstart and overview listed on that page, maybe even experiment with the sample script templates that you can find in blender's text editor.</p>
<p>Once you have an idea of the new python api take a go at re-doing your script. You will also find better help for blender specific python scripting at <a href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/">blender.stackexchange.com</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Is your path to Blender 2.74 the same as for Blender 2.49?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Try install afer uninstall.<code>pip uninstall blender</code> then <code>pip install blender</code> then <code>from Blender import.....</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@boardrider. My path to Blender 2.74 is different to Blender 2.49.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So, there's your answer. Follow @HelloNewWorld suggestion and you should be able to use the Blender 2.74 module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I read about that. I changed my code to support python 3.X but I think this problem is about Blender syntax, and not Python. Thanks for your comment, I going to search more about this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The python3 changes needed should be small, depending on your code, the main point is the api change in blender 2.50, all scripts from 2.49 fail in blender &gt;2.50, that is why I suggest getting familiar with the new api then go back to your script.</span>
