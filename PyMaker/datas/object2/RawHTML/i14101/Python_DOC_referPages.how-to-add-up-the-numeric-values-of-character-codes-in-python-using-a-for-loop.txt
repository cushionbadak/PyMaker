<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have my own name saved as a string under the variable name.
I want to find the character code for each character in my name and then add them all up using a for loop. This is what I've started with, no idea if it's staring about the right way</p>
<pre><code>name = "Ashley Marie"
for index in name:
    ans = ord(index)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Kasra solution is the correct one, but you asked for a "for loop"...so here it is:</p>
<pre><code> name = "Ashley Marie"
    sum = 0
    for ch in map(ord, name):
        sum += ch
    print sum
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>name = "Ashley Marie"
sum = 0
 for c in name:
    sum += ord(c)
print sum
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map" rel="nofollow"><code>map</code></a> to apply the <code>ord</code> function on all of your characters and then use <code>sum</code> function to calculate the sum :</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; name = "Ashley Marie"
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(map(ord,name))
1140
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use a list comprehension to apply <code>ord</code> on your characters but when you are dealing with built-in function <code>map</code> has slightly more performance! So I suggest <code>map</code>.</p>
<p>Also for longest strings you can use a <em><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/" rel="nofollow">generator expression</a></em> within <code>sum</code>,that doesn't create a list and can save a lots of memory:</p>
<pre><code>sum(ord(i) for i in name)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you. That does work but for what this is for I have to use a for loop, making things more difficult for me at the moment.</span>
