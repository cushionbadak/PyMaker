<p>I am getting ImportError for <code>from functools import permutations</code>, but it was working before. I am on windows 7 and the only major change I see is installing 
Anaconda now. I had python 2.7.10 when it was working, and anaconda 2.7.9...I tried uninstalling the regular python and running python in the Anaconda prompt, and still the same error. How can I fix this and still keep Anaconda? Thank you </p>

<p>I'm not seeing <code>permutations</code> in the documentation for <code>functools</code>:
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html</a></p>
<p>I am, however, seeing it in <code>itertools</code>, perhaps you misspelt?
