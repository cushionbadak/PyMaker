<p>I'm really struggling at installing any python modules (e.g six, yahoo_finance) because they require pip to be installed, but I don't know whether I have pip already or how to install it. Once its installed I don't know what command to type in and where to type it in. Can I install these modules any other way without pip?</p>
<p>I am only a beginner, so sorry if this is a bit basic.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p><code>pip</code> comes already bundled with <code>python 3.4</code> It will be in your scripts directory <code>C:\Python34\Scripts\</code>
Add it to your <code>Environment variables</code> and you can run it from any directory or else open the directory mentioned above in command prompt and run <code>pip install ...</code> to install whatever you want</p>

<p>First, make sure you have it installed, if not follow the instructions below. Type <code>which pip</code>, and if it doesn't list an URL, it means it's not installed yet.</p>
<p>Go here <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" rel="nofollow">https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py</a> and download the file.</p>
<p>Then open terminal and go to your downloads folder (or wherever you downloaded it to) and type <code>python get-pip.py</code> to execute the script. If you get an error that says <code>OSError: Permission Denied</code>, or something similar, run it with administrator permissions.</p>
<p>If the installation is successful, you should now have pip installed on your computer. Type <code>pip --version</code> to make sure you have it installed. </p>
<p>To install six and yahoo_finance, type:</p>
<pre><code>pip install six
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>pip install yahoo-finance
</code></pre>
<p>If something goes wrong update your question.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/#key-terms" rel="nofollow">Installing Python Modules</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pip is the preferred installer program. Starting with Python 3.4, it is <strong>included by default</strong> with the Python binary installers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine</p>
<p>If you already installed it by default you should be able to use it.
Just open the command line and type <code>python -m pip install SomePackage</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much, that's really helped - been searching around for ages</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user5036748 , accept the answer if it helped :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Dang! you beat me to it! :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But doesn't mean it was added to the .profile...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@James What do you mean? Could you elaborate your comment?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">/Users/User/.profile and /Users/User/.bash_profile. Its path t has to be there (or rather, best to be there) if the command is runnable. /where/ever/pip/is/bin has to be added if the tool's binary is in that folder.</span>
