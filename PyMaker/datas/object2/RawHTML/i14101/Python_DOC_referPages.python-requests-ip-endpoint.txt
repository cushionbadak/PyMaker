<p>I have a few IP addresses and I need to 'bind' a request to one or another one of them dynamically. I am using python <code>requests</code> library to make <code>http</code> requests (<code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code>). Is it possible to <code>bind</code> my requests to needed IP?</p>
<p>PS:
I asked because it is possible in .net C# to bind socket to needed output IP (<code>IPEndPoint</code>) so I thought it may be possible in python <code>requests</code> too.</p>

<p>What you are looking for is the socket library. Here is an example to get you started.</p>
<pre><code>import socket

HOST = ''                 # Symbolic name meaning all available interfaces
PORT = 50007              # Arbitrary non-privileged port
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind((HOST, PORT))
s.listen(1)
conn, addr = s.accept()
print 'Connected by', addr
while 1:
    data = conn.recv(1024)
    if not data: break
    conn.sendall(data)
conn.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html</a>, and toward the bottom you will see some examples for how to use the library.
