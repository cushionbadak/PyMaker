<p>For example, I have:</p>
<pre><code>a = (b ^ c) || d &amp;&amp; e
</code></pre>
<p>I want it to print only </p>
<pre><code>^ || &amp;&amp;  
</code></pre>
<p>I am new to python. Could someone help me with this? </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>We can filter out the unwanted characters with <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter" rel="nofollow"><code>filter</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = "(b ^ c) || d &amp;&amp; e"
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(*filter(lambda x: not x.isalpha() and x not in '()', a), sep='')
 ^  ||  &amp;&amp;
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you don't want multiple spaces or leading/trailing spaces:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(''.join(filter(lambda x: not x.isalpha() and x not in '()', a)).replace('  ',' ').strip())
^ || &amp;&amp;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can split the string by the undesired character groups and then proceed to join and strip space: </p>
<pre><code>' '.join(re.split(r'[\s\d\w()]+', a)).strip() # remove numbers, letters, and whitespace
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><strong>Edit1</strong></p>
<p>To correct misunderstanding I can suggest use regexp for this.</p>
<pre><code>import re
print(re.sub(r"[^\^|\|\||\&amp;\&amp;]", "", a))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Edit2</strong></p>
<p>Comments for code above.</p>
<p><em>re.sub()</em> function replaces by second parameter all tokens that match given pattern. Quick training you can pass here <a href="http://regexone.com/" rel="nofollow">regexone.com</a></p>
<p>That part of code finds all yours symbols using given regex and replaces them by empty string.</p>
<pre><code>r"[^\^|\|\||\&amp;\&amp;]"
</code></pre>
<p>That regex has a folowing parts</p>
<p>[^] - that tells find all symbols that not between [ and ]. ^ symbol used for negation.</p>
<p>\^\^ - your ^^ symbols shielded using backslashes</p>
<p>\|\| - your || symbols</p>
<p>\&amp;\&amp; - your &amp;&amp; symbols</p>
<p>All of them grouped using "or" statement ( "|" symbol )</p>
<p>In the end you have </p>
<p>^^ | || | &amp;&amp; without backslashes tells, find ^^ or || or &amp;&amp;</p>
<p>and in [^ ^^ | || | &amp;&amp;], finds every symbol that not ^^ or || or &amp;&amp;</p>
<p>But if you coding at first time, or you don't know python syntax yet, i recommend you just learn python at simplest examples, and after that learn regex syntax.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you provide an example block of code of what you've tried?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In your example, how would it decide to print those two spaces but none of the others?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the character set that you are trying to extract?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suspect the OP wanted to print only those characters, <i>starting from the given string</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yea, basically in a given expression, I want to print only the operations which are going on. I have a piece of C++ code and need to extract just the operations in each line of the code..</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do I specify that I want to print only if it finds "&amp;&amp;" and not when it finds "&amp;" ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Rashmi, I just expand my answer, because your question to general again for me, and I can't give you a clear answer again.</span>
