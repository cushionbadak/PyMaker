<p>This is updated version and there are no syntax errors so while it does now fix most of the errors, two errors remain. 
1) After the user has inputted an answer, nothing appears, not even the score prints.
2)The comment only appears after every question has been answered. 
How do i fix both of these problems?</p>

<p>One way to choose a random element in a sequence is too use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow">choice function in the random library</a>.</p>
<pre><code>import random
a = [1,2,3]
random.choice(a)
# this chooses a random element in the list a
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As was suggested, just put all the comments in a list as strings. To print a random comment, a random number between 0 and the length of the list is chosen as the index of the element that is printed. Run this program a few times to see it demonstrated.</p>
<pre><code>import random

comments = ["Correct, you get one point, onto the next question", "At least I'm not the only smart one around here",
    "Well done", "You must be really smart", "Some people have actually failed at that question", 
    "Congratulations", "Good work I guess...", "You actually got that right?!"]

print comments[random.randrange(len(comments))]

<p>Here is the bug: If the answer is correct, you are creating a list.. but in creating it, you use (and execute) the function "print", which in turn prints out your "correct" statement for all of the entries.</p>
<p>ie. Remove the print function from all of the list entries, and just print one of the result set using the random.choice function (as others have suggested).</p>

<span class="comment-copy">For the love of everything, learn about lists... And <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask">How to Ask</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">A good first step would to be to make <code>correctR</code> a list of strings - like ["correct, you...", "At least I'm...", "Well done", ...] - then you can try to pick a random item from the list and print it. Also when you are posting code samples here it is often best to edit them to be more concise</span>
