<p>For the following problem I am unable to find an answer.<br/>
I have my program to do various stuff to graphs in one file. After my class definition and functions I have my basic structure of which functions to call on a pair of graphs.<br/>
Now I want to have different extra files with a pair of graphs in each to show different aspects of my program.<br/>
How do I get that file into my main program as if the code that is in the extra files was in my main program?<br/>
I know, it is a basic problem but I never dealt with this before.</p>
<p>For illustration:</p>
<pre><code>class foo:
    def __init__(stuff)

    def plot(self):
        ...

    more stuff

# I want the following in an extra file #
# Two equal graphs

A = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 7), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)])
B = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 7), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)])
# That's it

x = foo(A, B)
x.plot
</code></pre>
<p>If I could also specify the file I want to load via command line, that would be even better.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can put your variable/graph pairs in their own python files and import them into your main file.</p>
<p>Ex.</p>
<p>example1.py</p>
<pre><code>A = nx.Graph([...])
B = nx.Graph([...])
</code></pre>
<p>example2.py</p>
<pre><code>A = nx.Graph([...])
B = nx.Graph([...])
</code></pre>
<p>main.py</p>
<pre><code>import example1 as ex1
import example2 as ex2

class foo:
    ...

x = foo(ex1.A, ex2.B)
x.plot()
</code></pre>
<p>If you really want user to specify which graph pair to use at command line, take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="nofollow">argparse</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html" rel="nofollow">importlib</a></p>
<pre><code>import argparse
import importlib
import foo

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Example app')
parser.add_argument('input', nargs=1)
args = parse.parse_args()

mod = importlib.import_module(args.input)
x = foo(mod.A, mod.B)
x.plot()
</code></pre>
