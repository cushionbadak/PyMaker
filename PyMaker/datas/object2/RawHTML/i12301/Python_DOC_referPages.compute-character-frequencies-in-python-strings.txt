<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I was wondering if there is a way in Python 3.5 to check if a string contains a certain symbol.  Also I'd like to know if there is a way to check the amount the string contains. For example, if I want to check how many times the character '$' appears in this string... 
<code>^$@%#$$</code>,
 how would I do that?</p>

<p>These are the built-in functions <strong>index</strong> and <strong>count</strong>.  You can find full documentation at the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow">official site</a>.  Please get used to doing the research on your own; the first step is to get familiar with the names of the language elements.</p>
<pre><code>if my_str.index('$') != 0:
    # Found a dollar sign

print my_str.count('$')
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.1/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow"><strong><code>split</code></strong></a> to check if symbol's in the string:</p>
<pre><code>if your_str.split('$'):
    print(your_str.count('$'))
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall" rel="nofollow"><strong><code>re.findall</code></strong></a>:</p>
<pre><code>import re
print(len(re.findall('\$', your_str)))
</code></pre>
<p>It returns <code>0</code> if there is no such a symbol in the string, otherwise returns count of that symbol in the string.</p>
<p>But the easiest way is to check and return <strong><code>count</code></strong> if symbol is in:</p>
<pre><code>print(your_str.count('$'))
</code></pre>
<p>It returns <code>0</code> if nothing is found.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">have you try using regex?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Thanks I will do more research on it!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">or <code>'$' in my_str</code> -- Which is a more idiomatic way to check for a substring in a string...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I looked into using '$' in my_str but I like the other better... @mgilson</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>if '$' in my_str:</code> is a better choice. As what you are doing is assuming the character is already in the string (Returns an error if not found). Additionally, If you have the string <code>'$Hello$'</code> the if statement won't return <code>True</code> for any string starting with the character.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"re.findall" sounds like an interesting way to do this that I have not seen yet i will look into it. Thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Good thing about findall that you can search for a pattern, not just for a symbol</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That might be helpful in the future if i decide to head down that road.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why would you use <code>split</code> to check if a symbol is in the string?  That's quite a round-about way to think of it (not to mention inefficient).  Also, regex for this simple problem also seems overkill . . . <code>'$' in your_str</code> is the best way to check if a substring exists in a string. . . If you need the index where it occures, then I suppose <code>index = your_str.find('$')</code> would be the suggested method. . .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes find/index or just if symbol in string would work just fine, but they are already covered in other answer/comments. So i just added couple other alternative ways, findall is good when you search for a pattern, that's why i mentioned it and split is just a short, i agree that find will work faster, because it'll stop after the first occurance</span>
