<p>I want to convert a very large XML file into CSV format without hardcoding tagnames.  </p>
<p>Can anyone help me out?</p>

<p>Firstly, you need to parse your XML files. This can be done via <a href="http://%20https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html" rel="nofollow">ElementTree API</a>:</p>
<p>Example code:</p>
<pre><code>import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
root = ET.parse('your_data.xml').getroot()
with open("output.csv", "w") as file:
    for child in root:
        print(child.tag, child.attrib)
        # naive example how you could save to csv line wise
        file.write(child.tag+";"+child.attrib)
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2148119/how-to-convert-an-xml-string-to-a-dictionary-in-python">There are also solutions to parse your XMLs directly as dictionary.</a></p>
<p>Then <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow">csv.DictWriter</a> can be used to save the dictionary as CSV.</p>
