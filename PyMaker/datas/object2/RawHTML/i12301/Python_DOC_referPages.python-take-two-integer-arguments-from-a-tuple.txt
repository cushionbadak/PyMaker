<p>This is just part of the question. It has error that missing 1 required positional argument 'mm' when running it. 
I know the problem is that it run like time_to_minutes((h,mm),)
what can i do to make it run like time_to_minutes(h,mm)?</p>
<pre><code>def time_to_minutes(h,mm):
    time = h*60 + mm
    return time

def extract_time(time):
    h=int(time[:-3])
    mm=int(time[-2:])
    return h,mm

def time_between(a,b):
    first = time_to_minutes(extract_time(a))
    return first
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the star (<code>*</code>) operator to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#unpacking-argument-lists">unpack</a> the tuple:</p>
<pre><code>first = time_to_minutes(*extract_time(a))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">aka the "splat" operator :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@AdamSmith I didn't know it's called that, thanks :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It's a borrowed term from other languages. Python doesn't give it a name. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2322355/proper-name-for-python-operator" title="proper name for python operator">stackoverflow.com/questions/2322355/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">To explain what happens: if you send in a tuple as an argument it will still be one parameter, just as a list would be one or a string with two letters would be one and not two parameters. If you instead unpack the tuple with <code>*</code> it will become two separate variables (works on lists as well and dicts for named arguments (then with two <code>**</code>)).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you so much!</span>
