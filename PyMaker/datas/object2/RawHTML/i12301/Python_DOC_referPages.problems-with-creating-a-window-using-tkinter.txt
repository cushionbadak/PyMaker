<p>I am trying to create a program using tkinter and it keeps on giving me this one error:</p>
<pre><code>in __init__ self.master = TK()
NameError: name 'TK' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>I am not sure why it is saying that TK isn't defined when I am importing tkinter, can someone please explain what I am doing wrong.</p>
<p>Here is my code:</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter import *

class App:
    def __init__(self):
        self.master = TK()
        frame = Frame(self.master)
        frame.pack()
        self.master.minsize(1080,720)
        self.master.maxsize(1080,720)
        self.master.title("Music Player")

myapp = App()
myapp.mainloop()
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's <code>Tk</code>, not <code>TK</code>. Take a look at this small code given in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#a-simple-hello-world-program" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> of tkinter. The last three lines are here for you.</p>
<pre><code>import tkinter as tk
...

root = tk.Tk()
app = Application(master=root)
app.mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>As a matter of fact, I think you were trying the code from the documentation page, yet you missed it!</p>

<p>It shouldn't be <code>TK</code>; it should be <code>Tk</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It's <code>Tk</code>, not <code>TK</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">instead of writing those 578 characters in your question, you should have taken a little peek at the documentation, or paid a small heed to auto-completion of whatever IDE you are using.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, I wasn't expressing myself correctly. Essentially what I was trying to figure out was why I couldn't have the <code>master</code> within the class itself. I am new to tkinter, but I have already gone through the documentation and have programmed multiple examples myself. I am essentially wondering why I can't put the master within the class itself.</span>
