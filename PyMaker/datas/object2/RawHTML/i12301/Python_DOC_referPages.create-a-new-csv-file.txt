<p>I'm looking to create a new .csv file using python and then write to the file after that. I couldn't find a command to create a new file using the CSV library. I thought something like </p>
<pre><code>NewFile = csv.creatfile(PATH)
</code></pre>
<p>might exist but I couldn't find something like that.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance! Happy to answer any questions you may have!</p>

<p>The <code>csv</code> module doesn't handle file creation; Python handles file creation as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow">builtin function</a> called <code>open</code> -- once you have a file handle created using <code>open</code>, you can use it with <code>csv.writer</code> or <code>csv.DictWriter</code>to write data to the file.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">@martineau Yes I have!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Evert I do understand the example. Writing to a file is not my issue, creating a new file is.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Which is exactly what <code>open('eggs.csv', 'wb')</code> in the example does. File creation is also <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files" rel="nofollow noreferrer">in the tutorial</a>.</span>
