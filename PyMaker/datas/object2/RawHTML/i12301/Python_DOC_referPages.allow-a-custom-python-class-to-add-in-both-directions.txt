<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have created a custom class that I want to be able to handle addition in both ways. As of now it only works if I have the class on the right hand side and the thing to add on the left (i.e. class+variable). How do I change the code below to include addition in the opposite direction (i.e. the other variable+class).</p>
<pre><code>def __add__(self,other):
 return self.offset+other
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__radd__" rel="nofollow"><strong>radd</strong>()</a> special function:</p>
<pre><code>def __radd__(self,other):
    return self.offset + other
</code></pre>
<p>This function will be called if the left operand does not support the addition operation and the operands are of different types.</p>
</div>
