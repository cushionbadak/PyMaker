<p>I need some help starting this please as I've just been staring at this blankly for quite a while now</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import permutations
import numpy as np


limit = np.arange(0, 1, 0.01)

a = ?
b = ?
c = ?
</code></pre>
<p>My intention is to iterate through each permutation of (a, b, c) where each is a value within in the limit. So I can test a function I'm working with to find the best possible outcome</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>This is a pretty direct application of the permutations iterator</p>
<pre><code>limit = np.arange(0,1,0.01)
for a,b,c in permutations(limit,3):
    # do something with a, b, and c
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>permutations</code> function will go through all 3 item permutations of the values in <code>limit</code> and assign those values to <code>a</code>,<code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>.</p>
<p>Make sure that you realize that there are quite a few permutations to loop through.  As <code>limit</code> consists of 100 values, there will be 970,200 individual permutations, so if the operations you wish to do with these values take much time, your code might take a while to run.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations" rel="nofollow">here</a> in the official python documentation for details on the permutations function.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, that's what I was after. I just for the life of me couldn't figure out how to put it all together</span>
