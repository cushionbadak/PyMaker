<p>I parse some ASCII text using python which return me strings like:
UI8, SI32, etc...</p>
<p>Based on those strings I need to compute the maximum value of the types and to replace them with following strings:
unsigned char, signed long, etc...</p>
<p>I found in python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html" rel="nofollow">ctypes</a> lib, but i was unable to find how to get maximum\minimum.</p>
<p>Does Python have something exquivalent to <code>std::numeric_limits</code> in C++?</p>

<p>How many such strings are there?  It might be quickest to define them by hand yourself:</p>
<pre><code>class MaxVal:
    SI8  = 2 ** 7  - 1
    UI8  = 2 ** 8  - 1
    SI16 = 2 ** 15 - 1
    UI16 = 2 ** 16 - 1
    SI32 = 2 ** 31 - 1
    UI32 = 2 ** 32 - 1
    SI64 = 2 ** 63 - 1
    UI64 = 2 ** 64 - 1
</code></pre>
<p>Or you could put them in a <code>dict</code>.  I put them in static attributes of a <code>class</code> because it's about the neatest way of letting you refer to them in a way that "feels like" <code>enum</code> constants:</p>
<pre><code>print( MaxVal.UI32 )
</code></pre>
<p>More programmatically, if your type string is a variable, you could use it like this:</p>
<pre><code>dt = 'UI32'
print( getattr(MaxVal, dt) )
</code></pre>
<p>The corresponding <code>MinVal</code> definitions are left as an exercise for the reader..</p>
