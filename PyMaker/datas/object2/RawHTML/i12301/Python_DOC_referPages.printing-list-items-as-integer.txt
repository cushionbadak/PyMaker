<p>So I have some code that reads a file that contains score in this format:</p>
<pre><code>lenard  1 
max 1
lenard  1
max 5
zack    3
max 4
james   4
zack    3
zack    3
james   4
eddie   7
james   4
eddie   7
eddie   7
lenard  4
lenard  10
</code></pre>
<p>I have code that takes the highest score for each name and outputs it from highest to lowest:</p>
<pre><code>data = {}
alpha={}
with open('StudentsScoreA.txt') as fobj:
    for line in fobj:           #
        name, score = line.split()
        data.setdefault(name, []).append(int(score))

for name, scores in sorted(data.items()):
    highest = scores[-1:]
    alpha.update({name:highest})
    print(alpha)

for x in sorted(alpha, key=alpha.get, reverse=True):
    print('{} your score was {}'.format(x, alpha[x))
</code></pre>
<p>The program works but the outputs is not correct:</p>
<pre><code>lenard your score was [10]
eddie your score was [7]
max your score was [4]
james your score was [4]
zack your score was [3]
</code></pre>
<p>I was wondering how i would make it print out like :</p>
<pre><code>lenard your score was 10
</code></pre>
<p>I did try to do this by doing this instead :</p>
<pre><code>highest = ''.join(str(item) for item in highest)
</code></pre>
<p>Whilst this does output it nicer the program does not print it out in a sorted order. How would I fix?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>use [-1] intead of [-1:]
The slice syntax (in list) will always return a list</p>
<p>[1,2,3,4] [-1] =&gt; 4</p>
<pre><code>for name, scores in sorted(data.items()):
    highest = scores[-1] #was scores[-1:]
    alpha.update({name:highest})
    print(alpha)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you need the highest score then use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max" rel="nofollow"><code>max</code></a> function</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import defaultdict
&gt;&gt;&gt; data = defaultdict(list)
&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('StudentsScoreA.txt') as f:
...     for line in f:
...         name, score = line.split()
...         data[name].append(int(score))
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; for name, score in data.items():
...     print('{} your score was {}'.format(name, max(score)))
... 
eddie your score was 7
lenard your score was 10
max your score was 5
james your score was 4
zack your score was 3
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Did you mean <code>[-1]</code> (last item) rather than <code>[-1:]</code> (list slice starting at last item)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No I mean [-1:] I only need the highest score of the student</span>
