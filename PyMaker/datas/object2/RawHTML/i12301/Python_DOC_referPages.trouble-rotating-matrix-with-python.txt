<p>I've created a function that successfully rotates the outside layer of a matrix.  I've tried adding a loop so that it does the same thing for the interior layers of the matrix, but I haven't had any luck.</p>
<pre><code>def rotateMatrix(mat,size):
    temp = []
    for i in range(size):
        temp.append(mat[0][i])
    for i in range(size-1):
        mat[0][i] = mat[size-(1+i)][0]
        mat[size-(1+i)][0] = mat[size-1][size-(1+i)]
        mat[size-1][size-(1+i)] = mat[0+i][size-1]
        mat[0+i][size-1] = temp[i]
    return mat

<p>Is there a way I could change this slightly to allow for rotation of the interior layers?</p>
<p>I am trying to do this without using any libraries or built in functions.</p>

<p>This will rotate the matrix by 90 degrees.<br/>
Notice the rotation is not done in-place, another matrix is allocated for the result.</p>

    # init rotated matrix with None elements
    rotated_matrix = [[None]*size for _ in range(size)]

        for j in xrange(size):
            rotated_matrix[j][size-1-i] = matrix[i][j]
    return rotated_matrix


matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],

<span class="comment-copy">I don't want to bother you too much, but range() is a built in function, which you did not want to use ;).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fair enough, but I meant no built in functions to deal with the matrix.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think the title of this questoin is a bit misleading.  When I think 'rotate a matrix', I think 'multiply a matrix by a rotation transformation'.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm trying to do it without any libraries.  I probably should have specified that in the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm aware of zip as well, I just wanted to implement this function from scratch so I can understand how to work with a matrix a little better.</span>
