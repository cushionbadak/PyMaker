<p>I am trying to see how many unique words there is in standard input.</p>

<p>I know I am on right track but if Tree and tree should not be counted as separate unique words.</p>
<p>Also Monday and 1 are words but – is not.</p>

<p>I guess this code snippet can help you in few lines. Basicly the idea is to use set.</p>
<pre><code>st = set([])
for lines in s.split('\n'):
    print(lines)
    st=set(lines.split()).union(st)
print(st)

<span class="comment-copy">What all counts as a word?  Characters and digits?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@zondo "Monday and 1 are words but – is not." I would assume "alphanumerical" is the criteria.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">would u say lower all the input and then check</span>
