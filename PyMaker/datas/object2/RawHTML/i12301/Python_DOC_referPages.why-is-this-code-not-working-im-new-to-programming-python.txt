<p>What am i doing wrong?
I can't figure it out, i hope you can help ^-^</p>
<p>And if you are able to teach me how to improve my programming then feel free to write me how to do it! Im open for learning new stuff btw sorry for my bad english :3 (edit: When i guess the right number, it still says "Nope!" and i have to guess another number.)</p>

<p>This looks like Python3. If so, use <code>guess = int(input("Guess: "))</code> instead.  </p>
<p>In Python3 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input" rel="nofollow"><code>input()</code></a> returns a string and you're comparing that string to an integer which will never work. So convert the return value of <code>input()</code> to an integer to be sure you're comparing apples to apples.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You need to put int in front of input, so:</p>
<pre><code>guess = int(input("Guess: "))
</code></pre>
<p>This will turn guess into an integer, so the code recognises it.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>input()</code> command returns a string and a string is not equal to a number (<code>"3" == 3</code> evaluates to <code>false</code>). You can use the <code>int(...)</code> function to turn a string (or floating-point number) into an integer.</p>
<p>I'm assuming you're using Python 3.x given that <code>print</code> is a function. If you were using Python 2.x, you should use <code>raw_input()</code> instead, as <code>input()</code> causes the interpreter to treat what was entered as Python code and execute it (like the <code>eval(...)</code> function does).</p>
<p>In 99.999 % of all cases, you do <strong>not</strong> want to execute user input. ;-)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Another rather major thing your program needs is to prompt the user so they know what they will be doing with your program exactly. I've added the prompt accordingly.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">What is not working? What do you expect as output and what is instead the actual output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">When i guess the right number it still says that the guess is wrong so i don't know what's wrong.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This looks like Python3. If so, use <code>guess = int(input("Guess: "))</code> instead.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much! Fixed it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You should put a little bit more information in there.  For example, he should probably make sure the input <i>can</i> be converted to an integer.  Otherwise, he'll be back here in another half-hour asking "Why is this code not working?"</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, @zondo. I'll augment it a bit.</span>
