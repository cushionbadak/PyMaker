<p>first time asking a question here, but pretty stumped and could do with a hand.</p>
<p>So i'm writing a program in python for a project involving argumentation. This script overall needs to take some nodes from a json file, and decide upon the linear order of the argument, and the put it correctly into a tree in order. However, the main issue I am having here is very basic. I need to move the line reader back one line if the "nodeInt" equals the "nodeIdentifier", so I can read a value from a previous line (the fromID). I've highlighted where these are used (one "seek", two "tell")</p>
<p>Unfortunately, currently it's just reading the same line and does not seem to be moving back like I believe it should. Have I just used these commands incorrectly or is something else wrong? Thanks in advance.</p>
<pre><code>while addingToList == False:
    if "toID" in line:
        print "finding id"
        print line
        #Finding the ID
        idStart = line.index(":")
        nodeID = line[idStart+1:idStart+3]
        nodeInt = int(nodeID)
        if nodeInt == nodeIdentifier:
            print "matching id"
            **input.seek(last_pos)**
            line = input.readline()
            print line
            fromStart = line.index(":")
            fromID = line[fromStart+1:fromStart+3]
            fromInt = int(fromID)
            print "FromID"
            print fromInt
            line = input.readline()
            line = input.readline()
        else:
            **last_pos = input.tell()**
            line = input.readline()
    elif "schemefulfillments" in line:
        print "reached end"
        addingToList = True    

    else:
        **last_pos = input.tell()**
        line = input.readline()
</code></pre>

<p>First, I'm not sure if you've just not included it or if it actually isn't there, but you're missing the declaration for <code>last_pos</code> before you use it as the <code>seek</code> index.
Check out <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html" rel="nofollow">the docs</a> on using <code>seek</code> and <code>tell</code> as well; it should be pretty helpful here.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Yeah it's not used until the else, as the else always comes before the "if" statement. I'll have a look though, thanks</span>
