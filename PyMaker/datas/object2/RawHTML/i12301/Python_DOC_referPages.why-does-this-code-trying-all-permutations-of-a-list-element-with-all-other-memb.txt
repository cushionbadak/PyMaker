<p>I have a large corpus of text (~170kB) which I want to train for a NLP application.</p>
<p>However, trying to make a list of all the elements of a list, paired with all the other elements of the same list one at a time, causes the program to exit with an exit code 137.</p>
<pre><code>def wordsToBigrams(words):
    totalSentenceBigrams = [(a,b) for b in words for a in words]
</code></pre>

<p>You are most probably running out of memory when building that list. To avoid that, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the <code>itertools</code> library</a> and process each pair as it is generated. Or save the generated pairs to file for later.</p>
<p>Specifically, use the <code>product</code> function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Equivalent to nested for-loops in a generator expression. For example, <code>product(A, B)</code> returns the same as <code>((x,y) for x in A for y in B)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>EDIT: Yes, your script requires large amounts of memory - this is the memory consumption on my machine:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">And how many words are there?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Around 27000 words.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Interestingly, I don't have any output yet but the program has not exited. Why does using itertools make a difference and let the program run its course?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ketcomp itertools uses something called generators. I will point you towards <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Python wiki</a> to understand how they work and how to use them. Basically, generators produce the result part by part, so the entire result doesn’t have to be stored in memory at one time.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ketcomp err, I am not sure, I believe I am wrong and itertools uses something called iterators which I am not too sure about :/</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks! Is there a better alternative to using product(a,b)? Is this a language specific delay? Comparable Java code completes execution in ~30 secs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ketcomp by “comparable”, do you mean that your Java code stores each generated pair in one gigantic array?</span>
