<p>Just a quick question regarding converting loop commands in IDL to python.</p>
<p>I have the following loop structure in IDL syntax:</p>
<pre><code>for ... do begin
   for ... do begin
      if ...
         ...
      endif else begin
         ....
      endelse
   endfor
endfor
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I would say that is roughly translates to</p>
<pre><code>for ... :
   for ... :
      if ...
         ...
      end if else:
         ....
      endelse
   endfor
endfor
</code></pre>
<p>In python.</p>
<p>However, I would say the endelse and endfor commands are redundant? But what should I replace them with?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You are partially right, you just need to abandon the <code>endelse</code> and <code>endfor</code> and replace <code>else if</code> with <code>elif</code>.</p>
<pre><code>for ... :
   for ... :
      if ...:
         ....
      elif:
         ....
</code></pre>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements" rel="nofollow">Python documentation</a>, here is an example for an <code>If statement</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = int(raw_input("Please enter an integer: "))
Please enter an integer: 42
&gt;&gt;&gt; if x &lt; 0:
...     x = 0
...     print 'Negative changed to zero'
... elif x == 0:
...     print 'Zero'
... elif x == 1:
...     print 'Single'
... else:
...     print 'More'
...
More
</code></pre>
<p><code>For statement</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; # Measure some strings:
... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
&gt;&gt;&gt; for w in words:
...     print w, len(w)
...
cat 3
window 6
defenestrate 12
</code></pre>

<p>Python grouping relies only on indentation, so you need no <code>end</code> for your <code>if</code> and <code>for</code> loops / groups.</p>
<p>This is valid Python code:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(5):
    print(i)
</code></pre>

<p>You don't replace them with anything.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#first-steps-towards-programming" rel="nofollow">the Python tutorial</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>body</em> of the loop is <em>indented</em>: indentation is Pythonâ€™s way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To end a block, simply return to the previous level of indentation.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There is no endif or endfor in python. You unindent the line to indicate that and elif is "else if" </p>
<pre><code>for ... :
   for ... :
      if ...:
         ...
      elif...:
</code></pre>
<p>I might be misinterpreting the "end if begin" as a new if statement instead of simply an else. In that case, it is </p>
<pre><code> for ... :
   for ... :
      if ...:
         ...
      else:
         ... 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">So, would it be elif or else. (I've had two answers one else one elif, I'm more inclined to go with your answer as you have higher reputation...)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Rep doesn't mean anything, just I spend too much time answering questions :) elif requires a condition like if this: do action1, else if that: do action2, else: do action 3. If you are doing a simple if else between like even-odd where there are only two conditions, you can simply do if, then else, and skip the elif</span>
