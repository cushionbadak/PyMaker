<p>I am working on a Python product which reads from a text file and adds up the numbers and shows the result on the screen. Here is my code. It works but I would like to modify the output a bit. Also, is there a way where I can modify the code to explain to a very new program(My brother in 10th grade, who will be starting Python as his very first programming language). Please notice that it is not a CSV file and should not be used as such. It is a text file with its contents separated by a comma.</p>
<pre><code>import sys

readFile = open("Products.txt", "r")
#reportfile = open("report.txt", "w")
reportfile = sys.stdout

Categories_seen = []
Current_category = None
Category_sum = 0
Total_sum = 0

line = readFile.readline()

for line in readFile:
    category,product,sales2014,sales2015 = line.strip().split(',')
    sales2015 = int(sales2015)

    if category not in Categories_seen:
        if Current_category is not None: # Subroutine, if possible
            print( Current_category, 
                Category_sum, file=reportfile)
        Current_category = category
        Category_sum = sales2015
        Total_sum += sales2015
        Categories_seen.append(Current_category)
    elif Current_category == category:
        Category_sum += sales2015
        Total_sum += sales2015

if Current_category is not None:  # Subroutine, if possible
    print("Total sales for", Current_category, "in 2015:",
        Category_sum, file=reportfile)

print("----------", file=reportfile)
print("Total sales for the farmer in 2015:", Total_sum, file=reportfile)
</code></pre>
<p>Right now the output comes like </p>
<pre><code>Vegetables 25691
Fruits 11796
Total sales for Condiments in 2015: 17649
----------
Total sales for the farmer in 2015: 55136

But I would like the out to be like
Products      : Sales
Vegetables    : 25691
Fruits        : 11796
Total sales for Condiments in 2015: 17649
----------
Total sales for the farmer in 2015: 55136
</code></pre>
<p>And the text file from which it reads looks like</p>
<pre><code>PRODUCT,CATEGORY,2014 Sales,2015 Sales
Vegetables,Potatoes,4455,5644
Vegetables,Tomatoes,5544,6547
Vegetables,Peas,987,1236
Vegetables,Carrots,7877,8766
Vegetables,Broccoli,5564,3498
Fruits,Apples,398,4233
Fruits,Grapes,1099,1234
Fruits,Pear,2342,3219
Fruits,Bananas,998,1235
Fruits,Peaches,1678,1875
Condiments,Peanut Butter,3500,3902
Condiments,Hot Sauce,1234,1560
Condiments,Jelly,346,544
Condiments,Spread,2334,5644
Condiments,Ketchup,3321,3655
Condiments,Olive Oil,3211,2344

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>What you want to do, to format your output, is to call a method named <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow">format</a> on what is called a <em>format string</em>. You would change your line <code>print(Current_category, Current_sum, file=reportfile)</code> to something more like:</p>
<pre><code>print("{:15}:{:&lt;10}".format(Current_category, Current_sum))
</code></pre>
<p>This will print the value of <code>Current_category</code>, left-aligned, in a field that is 15 characters wide, then print a colon, and then print the value of <code>Current_sum</code>, again left-aligned, in a field ten characters wide. Each set of braces is a like a hole that the corresponding variable given to the call to <code>format</code> will fill, and the cryptic stuff inside the braces tells <code>format</code> how you want the variable displayed. There's a lot of options and information available <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Don't try to memorize everything, but read through it a bit, taking a look particularly at the examples and the section titled 'format specification mini language'. You should play around with this for a bit in the python shell until it looks familiar.</p>
<p>Happy learning.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">"a text file with its contents separated by a comma".  You've just described a CSV file (Comma Separated Variables).</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Well we are supposed to use CSV in the code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ian Comma Separated <i>Values</i></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@KlausD. Correct.  I knew something didn't feel right when I typed it but I couldn't be bothered googling for the exact wording.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Any help, guys?</span>
