<p>What I’m looking for is take a specific chunk or segment from text file. How can I indicate to Python where to start and finish the reading or printing?
I found this example code but I couldn’t find an explanation for this particular technique. I know how to use the method “.split()” with strings but there are additional parameters that I don’t understand.</p>
<pre><code>a = open("text_1.txt", "r")

text = a.read()

print (text.split("&lt;--")[1].split("--&gt;")[1])

# Here this code splits the text on the text file, starting from
# the value inside of the second ".split()" and ends in the value
# inside the first. What I don't understand what means the one in brackets `[1].`

a.close()
</code></pre>
<p>As you may already notice, in this case, the text I want to print is between "--&gt; ..... and ..... &lt;--" symbols.</p>
<p>In addition, What if there are not symbols to delimit the text?, What if I would like to isolate a whole paragraph, without lossing the first and last words? What if there is more than one word or symbol that is specified inside the ".split( )" method? </p>
<p>Is there any way to indicate Python that I want to select lines according its line-number (in the case of importing a web page with urllib)?     </p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>When python reads a file it converts it into a list. Split is a string method. One way of doing this would be to convert it into a string and then split it like you were trying to do and write that into a file. Check dir(list) and dir(str) for methods.</p>

<p>To answer one of your several questions, <code>[1]</code> pulls the 1th item (zero-based) from the “primary” to the left. In Python, it's called a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#subscriptions" rel="nofollow">subscript</a>.</p>
<p>In your case, <code>text.split(...)</code> returns a list of tokens, and the subsequent <code>[1]</code> selects just one of them. Here's what's happening:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'foo bar baz'.split()
['foo', 'bar', 'baz']

&gt;&gt;&gt; 'foo bar baz'.split()[1]
'bar'
</code></pre>
<p>If you haven't encountered this syntax before, you may want to work through a Python tutorial before continuing with your problem here.</p>
