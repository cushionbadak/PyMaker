<p>So I have a list like:</p>
<pre><code>    L = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
</code></pre>
<p>and </p>
<pre><code>    for x in L:
        print(x)
</code></pre>
<p>returns</p>
<pre><code>    'a'
    'b'
    'c'
    'd'
</code></pre>
<p>but I would like to see</p>
<pre><code>    1. 'a'
    2. 'b'
    3. 'c'
    4. 'd'
</code></pre>
<p>I would like to have this work for any size the list might grow or shrink to.
I have tried a few things but I am very new to programming and nothing has worked.</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumerate">enumerate</a></p>
<pre><code>for i, x in enumerate(L):
    print('{0}. {1}'.format(i, repr(x)))

<span class="comment-copy">Using <code>repr</code> will not give the same result.  <code>print</code> uses <code>str</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm not sure what you mean.  I used <code>repr</code> because otherwise it won't include the quotes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see.  I'm not sure if that's what he wants, however, because his original would not include the quotation marks.  I could go either way on that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you Brendan. And thank you zondo, I just changed <code>repr</code> to <code>str</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Brendan, I looked on python.org at enumerate because I wanted to learn more. But it didn't answer a question I have about the way you printed it. in the beginning the <code>{0}. {1}</code> what exactly does that do?</span>
