<p>I was wondering if it is possible to simultaneously assign a variable and use it as a parameter for a function.
for example:</p>
<pre><code>number = 10
print(number*=2)
</code></pre>
<p>with the output being:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;20
</code></pre>
<p>also, if this was repeated:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;40
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Python's interpreter doesn't interpret such syntax on function call and will raise a <code>SyntaxError</code>. Since you want to write an operation it doesn't make any difference where you do that.</p>
<p>You can simply do that at the top level of your function or globally before passing to function.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can't. This syntax is not defined in the Python grammar and so it is not possible to use the result stored through an assignment as a parameter.</p>
<pre><code>test: or_test ['if' or_test 'else' test] | lambdef
[after some depth, you will have a comparaison, which is...]
comparison: expr (comp_op expr)*
argument: ( test [comp_for] |
            test '=' test |
            '**' test |
            '*' test )
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see an argument is basically an expression, possibly through a ternary operation/list comprehension. (the <code>test '=' test</code> is for setting <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9450656/positional-argument-v-s-keyword-argument">a named argument</a>)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">No, it isn't, as the error message should indicate. Why would you want it to be?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python doesn't have this facility.  The closest I know is the decrement/increment expression in C: an evaluation with a side effect.</span>
