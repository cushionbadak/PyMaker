<p>The calendar module has day of week constants beginning with </p>
<pre><code>calendar.MONDAY
Out[60]: 0
</code></pre>
<p>However, sometimes one must interface with a system (perhaps written in JavaScript) that uses the convention Sunday = 0. Does Python provide such constants?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are no such constants in the Python standard library. It is trivial to define your own however:</p>
<pre><code>SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT = range(7)
</code></pre>
<p>or, when using Python 3.4 or up, you could use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#functional-api" rel="nofollow"><code>enum</code> module functional API</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from enum import IntEnum

Weekdays = IntEnum('Weekdays', 'sun mon tue wed thu fri sat', start=0)

weekday == Weekdays.wed
</code></pre>
<p>and then you can then also map a weekday integer to an enumeration value by calling the <code>enum.Enum</code> object:</p>
<pre><code>weekday_enum = Weekdays(weekday)
</code></pre>
<p>I used 3-letter abbreviations but you are free to use full names if you find that more readable.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I just use this with <code>mydate.isoweekday()</code>, does the job.</p>
<pre><code>def weekday_sun_zero(self, isoweekday):
    return 0 if isoweekday == 7 else isoweekday
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>hope this helps:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime
weekdays_dic ={0:'SUN', 1:'Mon', 2:'Tue',3:'Wed',4:'Thu',5:'Fri',6:'Sat'}
print weekdays_dic[datetime.today().weekday()]
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">How about using an <code>IntEnum</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, the premise of my question was wrong. The calendar and datetime modules use the same convention. I've edited the question but perhaps simply deleting it would be best?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@kuzzooroo: there is no point in using <code>IntEnum</code> when using the functional API; we are already auto-numbering so can't accidentally use a non-int value.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I guess you could make the question about <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.isoweekday" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>datetime.datetime.isoweekday()</code></a>, which uses Monday-Sunday numbered 1 - 7? :-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the goal of using <code>IntEnum</code> would be the avoid having to use <code>.value</code>. I get <code>Weekdays.wed == 2</code> with the <code>IntEnum</code> without the <code>.value</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">or <code>return isoweekday % 7</code> for brevity</span>
