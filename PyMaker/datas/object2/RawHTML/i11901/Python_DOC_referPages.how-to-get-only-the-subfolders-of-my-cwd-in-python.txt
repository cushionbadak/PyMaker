<p>I need to get the subfolders of my current working directory.</p>
<p>I've tried with the <code>os</code> module and found the <code>tree</code>-command. I just need to get the subfolders not the sub-sub-sub-folders or whatever is in the subfolders.</p>
<p>Here is what I currently got:</p>
<pre><code>import os

cwd = os.getcwd()
dirctorys  = os.tree(cwd)
</code></pre>
<p>I created a <code>for</code> loop to print my tree, but this prints all the subfolders, <strong>including</strong> it's content. But I just need the subfolders, nothing else!</p>
<p>For example these are my directorys:</p>
<pre><code>root/me/cwd
        |-__init__.py
        |-mygeo.py
        |-subfolder1
        |    |-file1.py
        |    |-file2.py
        |-subfolder2
        |    |-file3.py
        |    |-subsubfolder
        |    |    |-foo.py
        |    |    |-foo2.py
</code></pre>
<p>I want python to return a tuple or a list having this in it:</p>
<pre><code>['__init__.py', 'mygeo.py', 'subfolder1', 'subfolder2']
</code></pre>
<p>I've analyzed the output of <code>os.tree(cwd)</code> when I printed it and found out that it's made out of lists. The first list seems to be exactly what I need, but I don't know how to get it.</p>
<p>How can I get such a list?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use <code>os.listdir()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import os

cwd = os.getcwd()
contents = os.listdir(cwd)
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to split the files from the directories:</p>
<pre><code>import os

cwd = os.getcwd()
_, files, directories = next(os.walk(cwd))
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Does <code>os</code> module has attribute <code>tree()</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I does and it gives me everything in anything in the directorys</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@h_e_u_r_e_k_a: It does not. There is an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.walk" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.walk</code></a>, but the output you're showing is more like what the *NIX <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/tree" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tree</code> utility</a> prints.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, it is walk, I derped out! I didn't see m code while writing the question</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That seems to be it, thank you!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Since this is Python 3, if it's actually 3.5 or higher, I should point out that <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>os.scandir</code></a> would make it easy to get the directories in a given path even more quickly and easily: <code>directories = [entry.name for entry in os.scandir() if entry.is_dir()]</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That is much more complicated!!!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Just a note that python 3.6.3 the order of "files" and "directories" is swapped.</span>
