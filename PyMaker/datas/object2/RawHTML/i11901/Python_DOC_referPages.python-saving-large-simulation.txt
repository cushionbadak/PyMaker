<p>I am coming from Matlab background and recently started coding in Python. I generate massive data using Monte Carlo and these are sometimes 10 dimensional arrays. In Matlab I have been using .mat file format to store these arrays, along with inputs and other parameters using struct.</p>
<p>What is the recommended storage or equivalent for Python ?</p>

<p>The standard object serialization in python is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">pickle</a>. From the docs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is
  converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse
  operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like
  object) is converted back into an object hierarchy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An example would be</p>
<pre><code>import pickle
mydata = [1, 2, 3, 5]
pickle.dump(mydata, open("mydata.p", "wb"))
mydata2 = pickle.load(open("mydata.p", "rb"))
</code></pre>
<p>An alternative would be to use something like <a href="http://www.h5py.org/" rel="nofollow">h5py</a> which is a third party module for writing data to HDF5 format. Depending on your application, this could be a more performant solution since HDF5 is designed with large numerical data sets in mind. In fact, the latest .mat files are actual designed on top of hdf5 files, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/mat-file-versions.html" rel="nofollow">source</a>.</p>

<p>you can use serialization objects in python with pickle library or cplicke for (python 2.x), </p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html</a>
example:
if you want save as file</p>
<pre><code> import pickle
 filetocreate = open('newfile.txt','w')
 pickle.dump(arrayxD, filetocreate, -1 )
</code></pre>
<p>then use you can use</p>
<pre><code> pickle.load(file)
</code></pre>
<p>-# Pickle the list using the highest protocol available. = -1
-# if not = 0</p>
<p>See:
pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL</p>
<pre><code>An integer, the highest protocol version available. This value can be passed as a protocol value to functions dump() and dumps() as well as the Pickler constructor.
</code></pre>
<p>pickle.DEFAULT_PROTOCOL</p>
<pre><code>An integer, the default protocol version used for pickling. May be less than HIGHEST_PROTOCOL. Currently the default protocol is 3, a new protocol designed for Python 3.
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">coming from a MATLAB guy, you can still save/load MAT-files in Python using SciPy: <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.io.savemat.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/…</a> :)</span>
