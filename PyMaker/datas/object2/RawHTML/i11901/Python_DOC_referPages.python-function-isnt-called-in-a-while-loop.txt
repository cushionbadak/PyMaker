<span class="comment-copy">i have put the function before the while loop and it works but when using exactly this in my main code it won't work</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>TypeError: 'function' object is not iterable</code> this is the error i get</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On what input is it not working?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You also have to move your function definition over your while loop otherwise the code will break.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is this python 2 or python 3? After looking at your prints, one assumes this is python 3 but there is a difference how input works on python 2 and 3.</span>
