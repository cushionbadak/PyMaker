<p>I've written a for loop code to print out different values depending on the value coming from a list</p>
<pre><code>percentages = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
</code></pre>
<p>It rounding the answer given by the calculation below to 2 dp but on one of the values I receive (3.5) it doesn't round to 3.50 </p>
<pre><code>tax_price = round(x/(100/percent[i]), 2)
</code></pre>
<p>x being the user's input</p>
<p>How would i go about making it post 3.50 rather than 3.5 </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You could use <code>format</code> for that. From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow">docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Preceding the <em>width</em> field by a zero (<code>'0'</code>) character enables sign-aware
  zero-padding for numeric types. This is equivalent to a <em>fill</em> character
  of <code>'0'</code> with an <em>alignment</em> type of <code>'='</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>print('{0:.2f}'.format(tax_price))
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>print('{0:.2f}'.format(3.5))
3.50
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>How about this logic ?</p>
<pre><code>percentage = [5,10,15,20]
x = int(input("User input"))
result = []
for i in percentage:
    tax_price = x/(100/i)
    result.append('{:.2f}'.format(tax_price))

print(result)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't put a zero at the end unless you use a string.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it is being changed into a string later on in the code for being printed</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What about <code>'{0:.2f}'.format(3.5)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">that would only work for the 3.5 value though wouldn't it. the user can input any number they want to get an output</span>
<span class="comment-copy">And <code>'{0:.2f}'.format(tax_price)</code>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I actually had that I copied the wrong version, sorry. It still doesn't fix the 3.5 though</span>
<span class="comment-copy">that worked thanks</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thats pretty much what i already had, i only posted the lines i needed help with</span>
