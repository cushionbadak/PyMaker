<p>This is the code i have so far for my gcse computing controlled assesment. I a trying to get the user to answer a question, then python will pick out specific words(that are the same as the words stored in a file) then link it to a solution.</p>
<pre><code>global line
global userinput
global word
def main():
    global userinput
    name=input("What is your name")
        print("Hello " +name+ " and welcome to our troubleshooting system!")
    userinput=input("What is the problem with your mobile device?")
    userinput=userinput.split()
    if userinput=="":
        print("Please try again")
    power_problems()

def power_problems():
    global word
    global line
    global userinput
    with open("keywords_1","r+") as datafile_1:
    datafile_1.read()
        for line in datafile_1:
            if "userinput" in line:
                print("Hold the restart button for 30 seconds")
            else:
                phone_problems()

def phone_problems():
    global word
    global line
    global userinput
    with open("keywords_2", "r+") as datafile_2:
    datafile_2.read()
        for line in datafile_2:
            if "userinput" in line:
                print("Take the phone to the manufacturer to get a replacement")
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main() 
</code></pre>
<p>My problem is that the code stops running after the for loop used in the function "power_problems" and i don't know why</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Check your indentation at <code>datafile_1.read()</code> and <code>datafile_1.read()</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>with open("keywords_1","r+") as datafile_1</code> - you typed the filename with no file type so the function will stop because there no such file or directory to read.</p></li>
<li><p>Try not to use <code>global</code> variables, it just <strong>not safe</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean with "stops running"? Is there any error output?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Is the value of "userinput" actually in any of the lines in the file? Also, pass your variables to each function, don't use them globally unless you need to.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You call <code>main</code> which calls <code>power_problems</code>. <code>power_problems</code> returns, then <code>main</code> returns. Now you are at the every end of the script, so it exits.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Challenge yourself in the next Python program you write not to use the word <code>global</code> anywhere. You're currently using it as a crutch so you don't have to think about scope.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">there is no errors output it just stops</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I thought the file type is the "r+"?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the file type is .txt, .dat, .docx.... and "r+" is the mode of the open function: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=open#open" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html?highlight=open#open</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">i have changed the file to ("keywords_1.txt", r+) and the code still just stops and there is no error message it just stops and does not print anything</span>
