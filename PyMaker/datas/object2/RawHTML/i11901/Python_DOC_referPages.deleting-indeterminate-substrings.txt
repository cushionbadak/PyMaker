<p>I am relatively new to python. Suppose I have the following string -</p>
<pre><code>tweet1= 'Check this out!! #ThrowbackTuesday I finally found this!!'
tweet2= 'Man the summer is hot... #RisingSun #SummerIsHere Can't take it..'
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I am trying to delete all <strong>hashtags(#)</strong> within the tweets such that -</p>
<pre><code>tweet1= 'Check this out!!  I finally found this!!'
tweet2= 'Man the summer is hot...  Can't take it..'
</code></pre>
<p>My code was -</p>
<pre><code>tweet1= 'Check this out!! #ThrowbackTuesday I finally found this!!'
i,j=0,0
s=tweet1
while i &lt; len(tweet1):
    if tweet1[i]=='#':
        j=i
        while tweet1[j] != ' ':
            ++j
        while i&lt;len(tweet1) and j&lt;len(tweet1):
            ++j
            s[i]=tweet1[j]
            ++i
    ++i
print(s)
</code></pre>
<p>This code gives me no output and no errors which leads me to believe that I am using the wrong logic. Is there an easier solution to this using regex? </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Here is a regex solution: </p>
<pre><code>re.sub(r'#\w+ ?', '', tweet1)
</code></pre>
<p>The regex means to delete a hash symbol followed by 1 or more word characters (letters, numbers, or underscore) optionally followed by a space (so you don't get two spaces in a row).</p>
<p>You can find out plenty about regexes in general and in Python with Google, it's not hard.</p>
<p>Additionally, to allow additional special characters, such as <code>$</code> and <code>@</code>, replace <code>\w</code> with <code>[\w$@]</code>, where the <code>$@</code> can be substituted with whatever characters you like, i.e. everything in the brackets is allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can utilize <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split" rel="nofollow"><code>split</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.startswith" rel="nofollow"><code>startswith</code></a> to accomplish your task.</p>
<p>Here <code>split</code> will make your <code>tweet</code> string a list of words separated by spaces. So then when iterating in a comprehension creating a new list, just omit anything starting with a <code>#</code>, by using <code>startswith</code>. Then <code>' '.join</code> will simply make it a string again separated by spaces. </p>
<p>The code can be written as </p>
<pre><code>tweet = 'Check this out!! #ThrowbackTuesday I finally found this!!'
print(' '.join([w for w in tweet.split() if not w.startswith('#')]))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Check this out!! I finally found this!!
</code></pre>

<p>Python doesn't have a <code>++</code> operator so <code>++j</code> just applies the <code>+</code> operator to <code>j</code> twice which, of course, does nothing. You should use <code>j += 1</code> instead.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>++i</code> does nothing. The fact that it's valid syntax is a coincidence. You have to say <code>i += 1</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do have a look at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/3654830">Why are there no ++ and --​ operators in Python?</a></span>

<span class="comment-copy">Personally this was more of the solution I was looking for.Thanks Alex. Is there a way where I can account for the case wherein the hash symbol is followed by special characters as well? Eg, 'asdasdas #$%@asdasdasd'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You're welcome! I've edited the answer for additional characters.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Edited to make it a better answer, do rollback if it's not required. Regards</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'd use if w[0]!='#', you can allow # in the middle of words.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Or <code>if not w.startswith('#')</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks guys. I was thinking if tweets allow '#' in the middle. I was going to check twitter. Thanks for the heads up. :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">...and the pythonic <code>if not w.startswith("#")</code> is also an option</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks idjaw, using spilt is definitely the way to go. However, your expression does not account for the following cases-&gt;    'dsfsdf#Throwback' and ' ?%*#Throwback'    All is well and good if the hashtag begins with a space.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for pointing that out. Is there a reason why the increment operator is not available in python? I have been coding with C++ and Java and both use the increment operator.</span>
