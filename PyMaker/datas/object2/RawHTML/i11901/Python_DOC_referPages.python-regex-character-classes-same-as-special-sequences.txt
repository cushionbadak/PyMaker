<p>What are <code>character classes</code>? I am only familiar with <code>special characters</code> (<code>*</code>,<code>+</code>,<code>?</code>, etc) and <code>special sequences</code> (<code>\n</code>,<code>\r</code>,<code>\s</code>, etc). Do character classes refer to the latter <code>special sequences</code>? Or are they something different altogether? If so, what do <code>character classes</code> include exactly?</p>
<hr/>
<p><code>character classes</code> appears only 2x in the entire page. It is poorly defined and does not indicate whether <code>\w</code>, <code>\S</code> are certain members of <code>character classes</code> or the only members. Further testing reveals that <code>\n</code> can also be used within <code>[]</code> but not something like <code>\A</code> - compounding the confusion.</p>

<p>Yes, it is a bit ill-defined, but at the same time I think it's rather intuitive. In short, "character classes" are special characters, or "escape sequences" in the form <code>\...</code> representing groups of multiple characters, such as "all whitespace" <code>\s</code>, "all numbers" <code>\d</code>, or "all non-whitespace" <code>\S</code>, and are a subset of those "special sequences".</p>
<p>There are three character classes you should know:</p>
<ul>
<li>digits <code>\d</code>, corresponds to <code>[0-9]</code>; note that those do not match floating point numbers, as the <code>.</code> is <em>not</em> in <code>\d</code></li>
<li>"word"-characters, <code>\w</code>, corresponds to <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</code>, but (in Python 2) does not include non-ascii characters, such as umlauts, accents, etc.</li>
<li>whitespaces, <code>\s</code>, such as space, tabs, newlines, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, each character class can be "inverted" by using the respective capital letter, i.e. <code>\W</code> matches everything that is <em>not</em> in <code>\w</code>, and similar for <code>\D</code> and <code>\S</code>.</p>
<p>Other "special sequences" comprise only a single character, such as newline <code>\n</code> or tab <code>\t</code> (although those are not really a part of the regex language, but just basic Python string escape sequences), and others represent abstract concepts such as "between a word and a non-word" <code>\b</code>, or "at the beginning of the string" <code>\A</code>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">character classes are a shorthand for a specific group of characters -- like digits, or alpha, or whitespace</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@tobias_k character classes appears 2x in the entire page. It is poorly defined and does not indicate whether <code>\w</code>, <code>\S</code> are included or the only ones. testing reveals that <code>\n</code> can also be used within brackets but not something like <code>\A</code>. So yes. I already have tried scrolling down</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Sorry about that comment. Yes, it is a bit ill-defined, but at the same time it's rather intuitive, in my opinion. In short, "character classes" are groups of characters, such as "all whitespace" <code>\s</code>, "all numbers", <code>\d</code> or "all non-whitespace" <code>\S</code>, and are a subset of those "special sequences".</span>
<span class="comment-copy">About <code>\A</code>: does Python's regex flavour support the different meanings for <code>\A</code> and <code>^</code> (and, presumably, <code>\Z</code> and <code>$</code>)?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RadLexus It seems like both <code>\A</code> and <code>^</code> match only the beginning of the string, and not the beginning of each line, if that's what you meant.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks - sorry for the slightly off-topic comment, by the way, twas Idle Curiosity only ;)</span>
