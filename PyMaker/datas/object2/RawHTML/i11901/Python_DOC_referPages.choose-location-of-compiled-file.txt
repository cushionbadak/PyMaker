<p>So I have a program that generates the bytecode of a python file. In this case i want to import statements from the bytecode(.pyc) file. I believe the file has to be in a parent folder so lets just say I want the file once compiled to be stored at /root/users/folder. But the code here only allows me just to compile it and store it into the current folder.</p>
<h1>Code:</h1>
<pre><code>from py_compile import compile as bytecode

bytecode(file='file.py')
</code></pre>
<p>Now I know a could just just move the file using another function but is their another way to store it specifically like how modules are stored in /root/users/__pycache__ when it is imported.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/py_compile.html#py_compile.compile" rel="nofollow"><code>py_compile.compile</code></a> accepts an optional parameter <code>cfile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import py_compile

py_compile.compile('file.py', cfile='/path/where-you-want-to-save/file.py')
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I tried the following  before but I entered a directory path instead of a file path and thought it was for something else thanks.</span>
