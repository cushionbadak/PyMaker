<p>I'm new to Python and I'm working with a 2D list and not exactly sure how to get the average of the rows.</p>
<p>For example I have this list:</p>
<pre><code>myList = [[70, 80, 90], [30, 40, 50]]
</code></pre>
<p>and I would like to get the average of the first and second row.</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<p>(70 + 80 + 90)/3 = 80</p>
<p>(30 + 40 + 50)/3 = 40</p>
<p>I'm implementing my <code>print_student_average</code> function, but I'm a little lost. Someone tell me what I'm doing wrong please.</p>
<p>Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    myList = [[70, 80, 90], [30, 40, 50]]

    print(print_student_average(myList))
    print_exam_average(myList)

def print_student_average(myList):

    total_sum = [sum(i) for i in range(len(myList))]
    average = total_sum/3

    return average

def print_exam_average(myList):

    col_totals = [ sum(x)/2 for x in zip(*myList) ]

    for col in col_totals:
        print("the average of the exam is: ", col)


main()
</code></pre>

<p>This should do what you want. Hope it helps!</p>
<pre><code>def main():
    myList = [[70, 80, 90], [30, 40, 50]]

    print(print_student_average(myList))
    print_exam_average(myList)

def print_student_average(myList):

    return [sum(row)/len(row) for row in myList]

def print_exam_average(myList):

    col_totals = [ sum(x)/len(myList) for x in zip(*myList) ]

for col in col_totals:
    print("the average of the exam is: ", col)


main()

<p>If you want, you can use <a href="http://www.numpy.org" rel="nofollow">numpy</a> package and its function <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html" rel="nofollow"><code>mean</code></a>.</p>
<p>To compute the average mark of each student, given <code>myList</code>, the code would look like:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy

def print_student_average(myList):
    students_avg = numpy.mean(myList, axis=1)
    for avg in students_avg:
        print(avg)
    return students_avg
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>axis=1</code> determines that the average is calculate over the rows.
With the list in the example provided, the output is:</p>
<pre><code>80.0
40.0
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, you can get the average for every exam using the same numpy function:</p>
<pre><code>def print_exams_average(myList):
    exams_avg = numpy.mean(myList, axis=0)
    for avg in exams_avg:
        print(avg)
    return exams_avg
</code></pre>
<p>In this case <code>axis=0</code> to get the average over columns, and the result for the list provided in the example is:</p>
<pre><code>50.0
60.0
70.0
</code></pre>
<p>About the problem in your <code>print_student_average</code>, </p>
<pre><code> total_sum = [sum(i) for i in range(len(myList))]
</code></pre>
<p>is the main problem. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range" rel="nofollow"><code>range</code></a> returns a list of integers starting from 0 to the length of the list, which in the example is 2. With the <code>for</code> statement you iterate over each value of the list from <code>range</code>, and then you are trying to use <code>sum</code> over an integer, which does not work as it is not a list. The solution that follows more closely your code is already provided in another answer.</p>

<p>How about this logic</p>
<pre><code>mylist = [[70,80,90],[30,40,50]]
avglist = []
for x in mylist:
    temp = 0
    counter = 0
    for y in x:     
        temp = temp + y
        counter = counter + 1
    avglist.append(temp/counter)
print(avglist)
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>list comprehension
<code>
[sum(r)/len(r) for r in myList]
</code></p>
<p>just for print
<code>
[print((sum(r)/len(r)) for r in myList]
</code></p>
</div>
