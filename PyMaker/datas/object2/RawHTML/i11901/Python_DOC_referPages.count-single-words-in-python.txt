<p>So I need to count individual words (specifically red and blue) in a python inputted list.
However, it cannot be for instance redish or bluemaybe.
Here's what I've done (I've tried if loops to catch it but hasn't worked.)</p>
<pre><code>r = 0
b = 0
cars = []
car = input("Cars: ")
cars.append(car)
car.split()
r = car.count('red')
b = car.count('blue')
print("red:",r)
print("blue:",b)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The following works.</p>
<pre><code># replace by 'carsStr = input("Cars: ")' if you wish
carsStr = "rad blue blueish redish red blue red" 
# str.split() returns a list of strings, never in-place
cars = carsStr.split()
r = cars.count('red')
b = cars.count('blue')
print("red:",r)
print("blue:",b)
</code></pre>
<p>Here are your mistakes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing <code>cars.append(car)</code> and then <code>car.split()</code> doesn't "expand" the <code>car</code> string in the <code>cars</code> list.</li>
<li><code>car.split()</code> doesn't happen in-place, it returns a list of strings. In your case, that list is lost since you don't assign it to a variable.</li>
<li>You also never reuse the <code>cars</code> list.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wan't a more complete counting tool see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#counter-objects" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#counter-objects</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can make a loop to iterate through the list then return your values
Split and append aren't necessary. When faced with a coding problem, try to find the simplest answer and the most concise without sacrificing any substance.</p>
<pre><code>for words in cars:
    cars.count('red', 'blue')
    return whatever_you_want 
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">What is the problem ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why not split it into words (there's a SO question with a good answer how to do that), then feed those words into a <code>collections.Counter</code> and just get the count from that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Manufacturers don't call their car colours 'red' and 'blue', they use words like Cherry, Matador, and Tahiti.</span>
