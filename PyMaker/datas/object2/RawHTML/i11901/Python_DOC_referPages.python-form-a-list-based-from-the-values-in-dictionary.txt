<span class="comment-copy">What have you tried, and what precisely is the problem with it? Note that you can't guarantee output order of values from a dictionary, it's not clear whether you need that.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's an inherent problem with this question. Dictionaries are unordered on their keys, so <code>list</code> with <code>list_size_limit == 3</code> could be any permutation of <code>{"s", "p", "w"}</code>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>OrderedDict</code></a> can help with that at least.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i have Orderdict() dictA is ordered</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I need all the 1st elements of all values of dictionary to be present in list 1st,  followed by 2nd elements...3rd elements</span>
<span class="comment-copy">"i have Orderdict() dictA is ordered" Please add this to the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">any alternative way to solve ? With out creating iter object</span>
