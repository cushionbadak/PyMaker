<p>Chapter <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html" rel="nofollow">Data Model</a> in the section of <em>Language Reference</em> of <em>Python documentation</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations
  between objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand the part that all data in Python program is represented by <strong>objects</strong>. But what data is represented by <strong>relations between objects</strong>?</p>
<p>Can someone give an example with explanations, please?</p>

<p>But what data is represented by relations between objects?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, in </p>
<pre><code>d = {2: 'b'}
</code></pre>
<p>the relationship is that the object 2 is mapped to the object <code>'b'</code> in the dictionary <code>d</code>.</p>
<p>In </p>
<pre><code>l = [2, 'b']
</code></pre>
<p>the relationship is that the objects <code>2</code> and <code>b</code> are the 0 and 1 members of the list <code>l</code>.</p>
<p>In</p>
<pre><code>class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, x):
        self._x = x

f = Foo(2)
</code></pre>
<p>the relationship is that the object <code>2</code> is the member <code>_x</code> of <code>f</code>.</p>
