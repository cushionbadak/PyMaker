<p>I have been trying to use the regEx module (regular expression) to single out punctuation, but I just can't figure it out. Does anyone have any useful information on this?</p>
<pre><code>import re

n = True
while n == True:
    name = input("What is your name?\n")
    invalid = re.findall(r'[^\s\w]', name)
    if invalid:
        print("Invalid!")
    else:
        print("That is a valid name.")
        n = False

name = name.lower()
name = name.title()
</code></pre>
<p>This is the new, updated code. Still looking for ways to break it. Comment if you find some way that it'll accept punctuation.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Your <code>valid</code> is <code>True</code> because all you do is check for existence of  a capital letter in your <code>name</code>. What you want instead is a single word that contains a capital letter in the beginning:</p>
<pre><code>import re
p = "^[A-Z][a-z]+$" #A single line that contains a capital letter followed by one or more lowercase letters
valid = re.match(p, name)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>When you something like this <code>re.match("[A-Z]",name)</code> you match that there is a capital letter (at least one) contained in <code>name</code>.
Try that instead:</p>
<pre><code>import re
import string
n = True
while n == True:
    name = input("What is your name?\n")
    chars = set(string.punctuation+'1234567890')
    if any((c in chars) for c in name):
        print("Invalid!")
    else:
        print("That is a valid name!")
        n=False
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Something like this?</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s="Sentences, with bad punctutation. What - does -this mean?"
&gt;&gt;&gt; import re
&gt;&gt;&gt; re.findall(r'[^\s\w]', s)
[',', '.', '-', '-', '?']

<h2>Use Built-In String Functions Instead of Regex</h2>
<p>It is faster and less complicated to use the built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha" rel="nofollow">isalpha()</a> string method rather than trying to use a regular expression. For example:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

name = input("What is your name? ")
if name.isalpha():
    print("That is a valid name!")
else:
    print("Invalid: only alphabetic characters allowed.")
</code></pre>
<h2>Sample Output</h2>
<pre><code>$ python3 name.py 
What is your name? foo
That is a valid name!

$ python3 name.py 
What is your name? bar1
Invalid: only alphabetic characters allowed.
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Post your attempts so far</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your question is too vague and broad; give us a representative input string, what you want to do with it, and what you have tried so far</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Jamil, edit your question to include that code instead of putting it in comments</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, sorry about that. I'm new to this website, how do I add a quick bit of code I've put together?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Alright, thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'll put a new piece of edited code that I got from another answer. I'm pretty sure it works, but still testing for ways to break it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Only problem with this is that it accepts numbers.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">edited my answer. Just make <code>chars</code> set to meet your needes.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Perfect! Thanks for your help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This helped a lot! I realised I could edit the validation rule so that it accepts nothing but letters. As the validation is for a name, I could add the following:      name = name.lower()     name = name.title()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">However, I'm still a bit curious as to how you would isolate punctuation :P</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What do you mean by 'isolate punctuation?'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As an example, an isolation of all upper case letters would be: ("[A-Z]")</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Given that definition, <code>[,.?;:]</code> (or whatever character class makes up punctuation for your purpose will 'isolate punctuation' I suppose.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Very interesting, thanks for your contribution. However, if I wanted to only have certain punctuation like "-" (hyphen) accepted in the user input, how would I do that?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Don't worry, I've finally figured it out. You can use a backslash before the punctuation. In this case: "\-"</span>
