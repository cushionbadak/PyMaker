<p>I'm exploring python. </p>
<p>If have now lerned from the answers, that when I use <code>*</code>, </p>
<pre><code>a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a*2
c = 2*a
</code></pre>
<p><code>a.__mul__()</code> is called to compute <code>b</code> and <code>a.__rmul__()</code> to compute <code>c</code> (and this is more expensive, since the integer is tried to be called first :))</p>
<p><strong>So, in general:</strong></p>
<p>How can I see which function is called for some shortcut operator like <code>*</code>, <code>and</code>, or <code>+=</code>, ...</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-numeric-types" rel="nofollow">Python language reference 3.3.7: Emulating numeric types</a> says this of the <code>__rXXX__</code> magic methods:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These methods are called to implement the binary arithmetic operations (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>//</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>divmod()</code>, <code>pow()</code>, <code>**</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>|</code>) with <strong><em>r</em></strong>eflected</p></blockquote></div>

<p><code>__mul__</code> is called when the object itself is on the left, and <code>__rmul__</code> is for when it's on the right. For these particular objects, <code>2*a</code> has the same result as <code>a*2</code> because this kind of multiplication is commutative, so it comes out to the same thing, so both docstrings are right.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">aaah! does r mean reverse or right or something?</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Tigerhawks links were faster, but thank you nonetheless! :) so the second part is left, how this is in general...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks for the edit, I had just thought of it myself, haha :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">The link answers my question, I have to confess :) ... but still it would be nice to be able to see this "from within", not by reading documentation, but e.g. by getting a list of all called methods. But probably this is not possible...?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This all happens in C code in CPython, so not really, except with a custom class</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I see. But this means: if I would overwrite the <code>__mul__</code> method and add a <code>print</code> statement inside to see when it is executed, it would be much slower because I overwrite in python?  But I don't see the connection. I heard of profiling, which should list all function calls? Would this not list these because they are built-in? Thank you for your patience :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes, thank you, especially for the links, now I understand the 'r'. But it still doesn't explain, how I can figure this out, what is called. I will read through your second link first, this will take some time, and then I can maybe accept this :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@Ilja - For the object on the left, <code>__mul__</code> is called. For the object on the right, <code>__rmul__</code> is called. For cases where it's not commutative, the two methods may be defined differently.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ah, no sorry, I understood that, of course. I meant about any other operators, different from '*'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You'll have to look in the documentation for that object/type to read about its defined behaviors.</span>
