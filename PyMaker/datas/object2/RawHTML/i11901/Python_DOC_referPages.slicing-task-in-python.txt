<p>See the comment of @BAH, just play with it, that's what I did.</p>
<p>I put several strings to show the build up of the answer, uncomment to see the sequence: </p>
<pre><code>#line='4 a 7 n q p 7 o 0 p 1 7 k w 0'
#line='4 a 7 n q p 7 o 07p51b7hklwm0u'
line='4laa7en8qdp97box07p51b7hklwm0u'

print line[:14:2]    #up to 14 every other one
print line[14::2]   # from 14 every other one
print line[-1:-14:-2]  # from last backward by 2
print line[-15:-30:-2]  # from 15th last backward by 2

<span class="comment-copy">Play around with slicing and try it out in the console to see how it works yourself: <code>print('12345678'[-5:-1:2])</code> or <code>print('12345678'[-1:-5:-2])</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">The question is well posed, I assume the downvotes are for not showing any effort to try, so next time, add some testcases that you tried. Don't be discouraged by downvotes, try again.</span>
