<li><p>I have a large document corpus, <code>D</code> which is basically a Python list of <em>n</em> filtered tweets.</p>
<p>For example, <code>D[0]</code> is "<em>New Exploit to 'Hack Android Phones Remotely' threatens Millions of Devices</em>" </p>
<p>Also, <em>n</em> is of the order 10^4.</p></li>
<li><p>Say, there's another list of <em>m = 10</em> topics for my documents in <code>Z</code>, that I wish to randomly assign to each document and,</p>
<p><code>Z = ['hack', 'tools', 'android', 'google', 'anonymous', ... ]</code>.  </p></li>
</ul>
<p>How do I go about creating an <em>n x 2</em> array, such that that the assignment of topics is (as close to) a truly random process?</p>
<hr/>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I'm not sure how to code this. Sorry if the explanation is a little vague, but there isn't much information to give. I simply want a way to map from <code>Z</code> to <code>D</code>, <em>randomly</em> (to obtain an <em>n x 2</em> array <strong>not</strong> an <em>n x m</em> array, honest mistake).</p>

<p>I think this is what you are after.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; D = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Z = ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [[i, random.choice(Z)] for i in D]
[[1, 'a'], [2, 'd'], [3, 'c'], [4, 'f'], [5, 'b'], [6, 'g'], [7, 'f'], [8, 'f'], [9, 'f']]
</code></pre>
<p>This list comprehension iterates through <code>D</code> (Your corpus) and matches each element to a random element of <code>Z</code> (your topics).</p>
<p>Tuples might be a better choice than lists for the individual pairs though, as they are more commonly used to represent a collection of different things - see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1708610/3714940">this</a> answer for when to use Lists vs Tuples.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">It would be helpful if you clarify your question with a simple example using small values of n and m. Also, you should post your own attempt at coding this.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring I've added as much detail as I could. There's not a lot going on in the code itself. I simply want to map from Z to D, <i>randomly</i>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I can show you how to build a Python list of <i>n</i> rows. The <i>i</i> th row consists of <i>m</i> tuples. Each tuple pairs the <i>i</i> th tweet with one of the <i>m</i> topics, in random order. Would that help?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@PM2Ring yes, that should work. I realised that I don't need an n x m matrix at all.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Take a look at <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice" rel="nofollow noreferrer">random.choice</a>; numpy may provide something similar, but I don't know numpy.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I might, in fact, need tuples afterall. Thank you.</span>
