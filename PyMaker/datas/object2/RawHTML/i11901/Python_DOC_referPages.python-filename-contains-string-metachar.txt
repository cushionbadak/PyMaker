<p>I'm using os.walk(directory) to show recursively all the files from that directory.
The thing is that i need to show only the files that contain an asked String in its name, and it has to manage metachars too.</p>
<p>What i have now is:</p>
<pre><code>for root, subdirs, files in os.walk(dir1):
        for filename in files:
            if substring in filename:
                name_path = os.path.join(root,filename)
                list.insert(END, name_path)
</code></pre>
<p>This works nicely, but if  <code>substring = *</code>, as i dont have files containing an ' * ', my list is empty.</p>
<p>So, how do I get this to work if <code>substring</code> contains a METACHAR?</p>

<p>I think you are looking for fnmatch:</p>

<span class="comment-copy">LOL. now I get this working ONLY if I introduce a metachar. If substring is something like "exercise1" it doesnt find it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Found it. substring must be substring=" * "+substring+" * "</span>
