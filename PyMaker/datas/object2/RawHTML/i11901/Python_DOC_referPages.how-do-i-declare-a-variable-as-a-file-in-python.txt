<p>This is incredibly noobish, but here's an example of what I want:</p>
<pre><code>class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.m_file = file() # name required
        self.m_file = None # readonly attribute error
        self.m_file = "" # readonly attribute error
    def ButtonPressed(self):
        self.m_file = open(tkFileDialog.askopenfilename(), 'r')
</code></pre>
<p>None of the attempts in <code>__init__</code> work.  I tried searching for <code>python init variable as file</code> but those keywords brought out a lot of posts not answering the question.  </p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>As noted in the comments, the open() function in ButtonPressed method will overwrite anything done in the __init__ call. I would recommend keeping this line </p>
<pre><code>def __init__(self):
    self.m_file = None
</code></pre>
<p>As this will allow you to check whether the variable is None before attempting to use it somewhere else in the class</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You probably want to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open" rel="nofollow"><code>open()</code> method</a>. I don't think that you'd want to do this in your constructor, but <code>open()</code> is what you're looking for.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can't pre-declare variable types in Python; it's dynamically typed. Whatever you assign to <code>self.m_file</code> will be overwritten in <code>ButtonPressed()</code> anyway, so it doesn't matter what you do in <code>__init__</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">You don't declare variables in python. Once it is assigned in <code>ButtonPressed</code> you'll have your file.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is the actual question? What is your end goal? This is unclear to me.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm 2,500 lines into my first Python program and was under the impression you had to declare all self variables in <b>init</b> first.  Oh boy, I made this a bit sloppy.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Once you call ButtonPressed you will have access to the file so remove everything from init, just make sure you call the method before you try to access the attribute, also be aware that you can only iterate over a file object once. Also if the file cannot be opened for some reason your app will crash so you should factor that into your logic</span>
