<p>I need to convert this python 2.7.0 code into python 3.5.0 code, can you please help me because i have never used python 2.7 so i don't know whats going on.
  Can you also use the "#" to explain whats going on</p>

<p>Here, it's basically three really, really common cases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Python 3k input is Python raw_input, it returns a string. (PEP 3011)</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>type_of_coin = raw_input("Enter the type of coin:\n&gt;")  # Python 2

type_of_coin = input("Enter the type of coin:\n&gt;")      # Python 3k
</code></pre>
<p>If you want something else, you need to explicitely convert the string into the right type.</p>
<pre><code>no_of_bags = input("Enter the number of bags:\n&gt;")      # Python 2

no_of_bags = int(input("Enter the number of bags:\n&gt;")) # Python 3k
</code></pre>
<p>You'll often see eval(input(...)) but I'd advice against this, if you know the proper type, use it!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Python 3k range is now an iterator, so xrange is useless, and you can use range instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>for _ in xrange(no_of_bags): # Python 2

for _ in range(no_of_bags):  # Python 3k
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Python 3k print behave now like a function, so you need parenthesis. PEP 3105</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>print "Difference in weight"+str(abs(difference))    # Python 2

print("Difference in weight"+str(abs(difference)))   # Python 3k
</code></pre>
<p>I'll let it to you to do the changes.</p>
