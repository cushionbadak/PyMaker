<p>Im making a quick snap game for fun, just learning to code, and I canâ€™t seem to get around this problem.</p>
<pre><code>set1 = ["Horse", "Cow", "Pig", "Goat", "Chicken", "Sheep", "Donkey", "Duck", "Rabbit"]
set2 = ["Horse", "Cow", "Pig", "Goat", "Chicken", "Sheep", "Donkey", "Duck", "Rabbit"]
random.shuffle(set1,random.random)
random.shuffle(set2,random.random)
side1 = int(input("What number would you like to pick from side one?"))
side2 = int(input("What number would you like to pick from side two?"))
s1pick = set1.index(side1)
s2pick = set2.index(side2)
picks = []
</code></pre>
<p>I want them to input 2 numbers for <code>side1</code> and <code>side2</code>, then store what the corresponding values from <code>set1</code> and <code>set2</code> are in <code>s2pick</code> and <code>s1pick</code>. But I keep getting this error message:</p>
<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "C:/Users/Me/PycharmProjects/nice memes/src/snap.py", line 26, in &lt;module&gt;
        s1pick = set1.index(side1)
ValueError: 4 is not in list

<p>Using python 3 on pycharm community edition. Thanks!</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#common-sequence-operations" rel="nofollow"><code>list.index()</code></a> returns the <em>index</em> of the element value you pass it to. So for a list <code>l = ['a', 'b', 'c']</code>, <code>l.index('b')</code> would return <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to go the other direction, getting a value for an index, then you should use the item access syntax:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = ['a', 'b', 'c']
&gt;&gt;&gt; l[1]
'b'
</code></pre>
<p>So in your case, you want to use <code>set1[side1]</code> in order to get the value that the user chose from <code>set1</code>.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p><code>index()</code> <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/datastructures.html" rel="nofollow">actually returns the index of the value that you pass to the method</a>. You're getting an error because the value <code>4</code> isn't in the list that you're calling the <code>index()</code> method on. If you're already turning the prompt into an <code>int()</code> after getting it from the user, then you can just specify that you'd want the element at that index from the list like this:</p>
<pre><code>s1pick = set1[side1]
s2pick = set2[side2]
</code></pre>
<p>Be careful, though. The <code>input()</code> that you get could be out of range of your lists. So, I would would put your inputs into a while loop to make sure that you get a valid input:</p>
<pre><code>side1 = # input code
side2 = # input code

while side1 not in range(len(set1)) or side2 not in range(len(set2)):
    side1 = # input code
    side2 = # input code
</code></pre>

<p>comparing the two pieces code:</p>
<pre><code>list1 = ["Horse", "Cow", "Pig", "Goat", "Chicken", "Sheep", "Donkey", "Duck", "Rabbit"]
list2 = ["Horse", "Cow", "Pig", "Goat", "Chicken", "Sheep", "Donkey", "Duck", "Sheep"]

######################
index1 = 2
index2 = 3
element1 = list1[index1]
element2 = list2[index2]
print (element1) # output: Pig
print (element2) # output: Goat

index1 = list1.index("Sheep")
index2 = list2.index("Donkey")
print (index1)   # output: 5
print (index2)   # output: 6

<span class="comment-copy">I think you mean <code>set1[side1]</code> instead <code>set1.index(side1)</code>, you want index 4 not value 4</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks, this helped alot. I should of probably know this but i havent used python since i used it in class a few months ago.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I would use <code>set1[side1-1]</code>, so you don't have to think about starting at 0.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I was planning on going back and stoping the code from breaking like that, but i was going to use Exception handlers, which would be better?</span>
