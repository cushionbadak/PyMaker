<p>I have a problem with Python 3. I got Python 2.7 code and at the moment I am trying to update it. I get the error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: object of type 'map' has no len()</p>
</blockquote>
<p>at this part:</p>
<pre><code>str(len(seed_candidates))
</code></pre>
<p>Before I initialized it like this:</p>
<pre><code>seed_candidates = map(modify_word, wordlist)
</code></pre>
<p>So, can someone explain me what I have to do?</p>
<p>(EDIT: Previously this code example was wrong because it used <code>set</code> instead of <code>map</code>. It has been updated now.)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In Python 3, <code>map</code> returns a map object not a <code>list</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; L = map(str, range(10))
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(L)
&lt;map object at 0x101bda358&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(len(L))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: object of type 'map' has no len()
</code></pre>
<p>You can convert it into a list then get the length from there:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(len(list(L)))
10
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">It works for me. Post a full example that demonstrates the problem. You didn't even call <code>map</code> anywhere in the code above.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is currently the top result from Google and the current question doesn't really have a great example of <code>map</code>, so I'm going to edit the question somewhat drastically and change the code the OP originally had. I imagine OP missed out something back when the question was first asked two years ago. Feel free to revert if anyone objects</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I think there is a canonical question/answer for this. The above question is a duplicate.</span>
