<p>I'm trying to import a github repository in my travis build. I do this by calling </p>
<pre><code>install:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>in <code>.travis.yml</code>. My requirements file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>git+ssh://git@github.com/my_account/repository_test.git@development
git+ssh://git@github.com/my_account/repository_test_ii.git@development
</code></pre>
<p>This seems to work, because both repositories are listed when I call <code>pip freeze</code>. However, when I do:</p>
<pre><code>import repository_test
import repository_test_ii
</code></pre>
<p>the second import fails. Both github repositories have a correct setup.py file, and I can install everything locally without any problem. I ran out of ideas of things to check.</p>
<p>I think the problem is probably with my github repository, I suspect probably the module is being imported under a slightly different name. How can I check this? What other things could I check?</p>

<p>The problem was that I was missing an __init__.py file in my github repository making it impossible to import it.</p>
