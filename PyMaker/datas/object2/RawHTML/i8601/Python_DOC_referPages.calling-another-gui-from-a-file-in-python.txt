<p>Suppose I have one GUI with a simple code as follows
It has a button on it and when this is clicked I want to have another GUI to pop-up and then call the function from it. The problem is that when I run the first file, the GUI of the other one automatically pop-up. What should I do.</p>
<p>The code of the <code>first</code> file is as follows</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter import *
import another

root = Tk()

button1 = Button(root, text = "Call" , command = another.abc)
button1.pack()

root.mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>The code of second file <code>another.py</code> is as follows</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter import *

root_Test2 = Tk()
root_Test2.geometry('450x450')

def abc():
     print("that's working")


root_Test2.mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>Please suggest the solution that help me to open the second window when the button on the first one is clicked</p>

<p>According to @PM 2Ring, You can change your second file's code to this:</p>
<pre><code>from tkinter import *
if __name__ == '__main__':
    root_Test2 = Tk()
    root_Test2.geometry('450x450')

def abc():
     print("that's working")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    root_Test2.mainloop()
</code></pre>
<p>You can find further information about <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do">here</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">To import one .py file into another you need to structure it properly as a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">module</a> so that the code doesn't get run when you import it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">can you suggest the changes, I have to make in second file so that mainloop() of the second don't get called</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you've read that tutorial article I linked you to, you should be able to figure that out for yourself. It's not just the <code>mainloop</code> that shouldn't get run, the <code>root_Test2 = Tk()</code> and <code>root_Test2.geometry('450x450')</code> shouldn't get run either. Only the Tkinter import and the <code>abc</code> function definition can get executed. The other stuff <i>must</i> be protected inside a <code>if __name__ == "__main__":</code> block.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So have a go at doing that, and if you <i>still</i> can't figure it out, edit the code in your question to show your latest attempt.</span>
