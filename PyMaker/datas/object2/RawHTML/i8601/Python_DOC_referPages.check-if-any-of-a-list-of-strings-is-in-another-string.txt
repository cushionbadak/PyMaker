<p>In python, I'm trying to create a program which checks if 'numbers' are in a string, but I seem to get an error. Here's my code:</p>
<pre><code>numbers = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0"]

test = input()

print(test)
if numbers in test:
    print("numbers")
</code></pre>
<p>Here's my error:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: 'in &lt;string&gt;' requires string as left operand, not list
</code></pre>
<p>I tried changing numbers into <code>numbers = "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0"</code> which is basically removed the <code>[]</code> but this didn't work either. Hope I can get an answer; thanks :)</p>

<p>Use built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any" rel="noreferrer"><strong><em>any()</em></strong></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>numbers = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "0"]
s = input()

test = any(n in s for n in numbers)
print(test)
</code></pre>

<p>In a nutshell, you need to check each digit individually.</p>
<p>There are many ways to do this:</p>
<p>For example, you could achieve this using a loop (left as an exercise), or by using sets</p>
<pre><code>if set(test) &amp; set(numbers):
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>or by making use of <code>str.isdigit</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if any(map(str.isdigit, test)):
  ...
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that both examples assume that you're testing for digits, and don't readily generalize to arbitrary substrings.)</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Other possible way may be to iterate through each character and check if it is numeric using <code>isnumeric()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>input_string = input()

# to get list of numbers
num_list = [ch for ch in input_string if ch.isnumeric()]
print (num_list)

# can use to compare with length to see if it contains any number
print(len(num_list)&gt;0)
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>input_string = 'abc123'</code> then, <code>num_list</code> will store all the numbers in <code>input_string</code> i.e. <code>['1', '2', '3']</code> and <code>len(num_list)&gt;0</code> results in <code>True</code>.</p>

<p>As NPE said, you have to check every single digit. The way i did this is with a simple for loop.</p>
<pre><code>for i in numbers:
    if i in test:
        print ("test")
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this helped :)</p>
