<p>I am trying to make a code block that creates a series of .txt file names.  It will open a new file and prompt the user to enter text for the file, continuing until the user doesn't want any more files.</p>
<p>How do I get it to create a series of file names such as <strong>file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt</strong>, etc. ?</p>

<p>Assuming you do know in advance how many files are required you can pass a start value to the function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=range#range" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>range()</em></a></p>
<pre><code>fnum = 10
fname = 'file'
ext = '.txt'

for i in range(1, fnum + 1):
    with open("{fname}{fnum}{ext}".format(fname=fname, fnum=i, ext=ext), 'w') as f:
    # OR for Python 3.6+
    # with open(f'{fname}{i}{ext}', 'w') as f:
