<p>I have a txt file which I need to access through python. The data in the txt file displays a football league in CSV format. The CSV data covers the games played, won and lost, where this will calculate the teams points (2 points for a win, 0 for a loss). I have an idea on how to start this but not sure if I have started on the right foot.</p>
<p>How do I calculate the total points for each team? And can I get the headings above the data from the txt file? (Team,Played, Won, Lost, Total) Any support would be appreciated.</p>
<p>CSV Data:</p>
<pre><code>Liverpool,19,7,12
Chelsea,19,8,11
Arsenal,19,0,19
Tottenham,19,7,12
Man Utd,19,7,12
Man City,19,5,14
Southampton,19,3,16
</code></pre>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code>    text_file = open ("leagueResults.txt","r")
    print (text_file.read())
    text_file.close()
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned in the comments you should look into the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>csv</code></a> module.</p>
<p>However in your case since I assume you have just started learning python and the problem is relatively trivial we can do it by just reading the file line by line splitting on the delimiter <code>,</code>.</p>
<pre><code>team_name = []
games_won = []

num_records = 0
with open('leagueResults.txt') as f:
    for line in f:
        record = line.strip().split(',')
        team_name.append(record[0])
        games_won.append(record[2])
        num_records += 1

print("Points Table")
print("============")
for i in range(0, num_records):
    print("%s: %d" % (team_name[i], (int(games_won[i]) * 2)))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Points Table
============
Liverpool: 14
Chelsea: 16
Arsenal: 0
Tottenham: 14
Man Utd: 14
Man City: 10
Southampton: 6
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how I am only interested in the <code>team_name</code> and <code>games_won</code> since those are the only two actually required to calculate the amount of points per team in the problem (<code>games_played</code> is always <code>19</code> and <code>games_lost</code> has no affect on the total points as it is multiplied by a scale factor of <code>0</code> in the total points calculation). </p>

<span class="comment-copy">look into the <code>csv</code> module.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Where is the question? Okay, you opened the file... Now what?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How do I calculate the total points for each team? And can I get the headings above the data from the txt file? (Team,Played, Won, Lost, Total)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That has nothing to do with using the text file, that's just processing the text after you've read it, which you showed you know how to do.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">But if this data is updated, how can i produce some code to re-calculate the points?</span>
