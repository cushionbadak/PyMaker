<p>I have a line of code that rings a bell in the cmd when the program requires interaction from the user.I do that in python with the print('\a') command. However I want to put this command behind a configuration option because I don't want a bell ringing on every prompt. How can I do that?? Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Any number of ways you can do this. One would be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#quick-start" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>configparser</code></a>. Many <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/ConfigParserExamples" rel="nofollow noreferrer">usage examples here</a>.</p>
<p>Put the bell sound into a variable and prefix it before each <code>print</code>. Use <code>'\a'</code> when you want it and <code>''</code> when you don't.</p>
<p>in your config.INI, or any other means of getting the preference from the user:</p>
<pre><code>[DEFAULT]
bell_sound = True   # or False
</code></pre>
<p>And for all places you may want the bell:</p>
<pre><code>if config['DEFAULT'].getboolean('bell_sound'):
    bell = '\a'    # yes
else:
    bell = ''     # no sound

# usage:
print('%shello' % bell)
print('{}{}'.format(bell, 'hello'))
s = input('{}{}'.format(bell, 'user input'))
</code></pre>
<p>And probably better to put that into a function like <code>ask_user()</code> so that you don't have to always write those print/input lines.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You didn't get my my question.Perhaps its my fault. I am trying to say that I have a line of code: print(\a) tha runs whenever user interaction is needed.However I want that to happen only when the user has allowed bell sounds to ring from his machine configuration</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@SpirosChadoulos: usually the bell sound is already disabled by a user. You can usually configure the terminal whether to or not to sound a bell.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My point is that I want the bell to ring only when the user has allowed that. Something like:   if(user_config==allow bells){ring bell}</span>
