<p>I am having a problem with an error message about tk not being defined? </p>
<p>How can I get around this, I thought I defined it. I was wondering if it was a problem with the <code>window = tk</code> but when I remove one and vice versa the define problem still occurs.</p>
<pre><code>import tkinter
import os

window = tk()
window.title("Computer Science Revision")
window.geometry("1000x1000")
window.wm_iconbitmap('favicon.ico')
window.configure(background="#a1dbcd")

photo= tkinter.PhotoImage(file="ryu.gif")
w = tkinter.Label(image=photo)
w.pack()

creds = 'tempfile.temp'

def Signup():
    global pwordE
    global NameE
    global roots

    roots = Tk()
    roots.title('Signup')
    insturction = Label(roots, text= 'Please enter new Credentials\n')
    instruction.grid(row=0, column =0,sticky=W)

    nameL =  Label(roots, text='New Username: ')
    pwordL =  Label(roots, text='New Password: ')
    nameL.grid(row=1, column=0, sticky=W)
    pword.grid(row=2, column=0, sticky=W)
    nameE = Entry(roots)
    pwordE = Entry(roots, show='*')
    nameL.grid(row=1, column=1)
    pwordE.grid(row=2, column=1)

    signupButton = Button(roots, text='Signup', command=FSSignup)
    signupButton.grid(columnspan=2, sticky=W)
    roots.mainloop()

<p>Your code is a bit namespace messed up. Some parts of your code follows the format <code>from tkinter import *</code> provides. While some parts followed the format <code>import tkinter</code>. You <em>can</em> do both, but it's not preferred. 
Many people like to use import <code>tkinter as tk</code> since it's easy to type and use.</p>
<p>Your error is that you used <code>tk()</code> which isn't a thing. <code>tkinter.Tk()</code> is probably what you meant. </p>
<p>And you should change all <code>Label</code> to <code>tkinter.Label</code> and <code>Entry</code> to <code>tkinter.Entry</code> inside your <code>Signup</code> function, to fit your <code>import tkinter</code> code. The place where you copied from most likely had <code>from tkinter import *</code> in the top.</p>

<span class="comment-copy"><code>import tkinter ; import os ; window = tk()</code> Where does anything named <code>tk</code> being defined?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You didn't import the name <code>tk</code>. You only imported the module <code>tkinter</code>. Besides, the class is called <code>Tk</code> (uppercase <code>T</code>). If you are importing just the module, use <code>window = tkinter.Tk()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As always, carefully review the documentation, this is covered in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#tkinter-modules" rel="nofollow noreferrer">module introduction</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">still facing problems of "GlobalEL" not being defined</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks very much for your help :) im still learning</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Did my answer provided you a better understanding? If so, feel free to accept my answer and/or upvote. But if not, what else regarding your question do you need better understanding with?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now receiving an error comment; global name e is not defined in instruction.grid(row=0, column=0, sticky=E)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it's tk.E just like everything else</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's so much way of doing things, you can also include in the top <code>from tkinter.constants import *</code> that way you wouldn't have to change the constants. ie. E, W</span>
