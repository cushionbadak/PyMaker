<p>You forgot the ":" at the end of condition.</p>
<pre><code>if continue_shopping !=1:
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT - second problem</strong>: Of course you still have an other syntax error. You should have an <code>except</code> clause after you <code>try</code>. You really have to read <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a> before asking that kind of question.</p>

<p>Next to the syntax eror semicolon at end of <code>if continue_shopping !=1:</code> (pointed out by @N0un</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix your indentation. There is no try-if block. You should indent the if conditions</li>
<li>Rework your ifs: they fall through on error scenarios</li>
<li>Missing except of your try</li>
</ul>
<p>For example: (don't have a python compiler here, so bare the syntax errors:)</p>
<pre><code>while True:
    try:
        continue_shopping=int(input("press 0 to stop shopping and print your reciept or press 1 to continue shopping"))
        if continue_shopping !=0 and continue_shopping !=1:

<span class="comment-copy">You  forgot ":" at the end of the condition</span>
<span class="comment-copy">You can't use a <code>try-if</code> clause</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Next to the syntax error: Python needs proper indentation. All the code in the try: block needs an idditional indenation. Also keep_searching = False.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So i cannot use try and if in the same argument?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@MeTooThanks Instead of constantly jumping back at the very next error you are getting, maybe you need to actually read the error messages you are getting. A lot of the problems that are happening in your code have pretty explicit error messages that will indicate to you what your mistakes are.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Still get a invalid syntax on the fifth line -_-</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So should this be fine?  while True:         try:             continue_shopping=int(input("press 0 to stop shopping and print your reciept or press 1 to continue shopping"))         if continue_shopping !=0 and continue_shopping !=1:         except             print(" make sure you enter 0 or 1")         if continue_shopping !=1:             keep_searching = False         if (continue_shopping == 0):             fileOne.close()</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How can I read indentation in this comment??</span>
