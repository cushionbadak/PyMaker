<p>I am trying to store information in dictionary that I want to access later. I am doing it dynamically using variables, where "badgeID" is a global counter that I am using as key and value is an array/list that I get from the user. </p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TRPer.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img alt="Here is the screen shot" src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/TRPer.png"/></a></p>
<p>The problem that when I try to add more than one K:V to the dictionary, it adds a key but replaces all the previously stored values(in this case it is an array/list) with the newest one. Any help would be really appreciated. Thanks </p>

<p>The technique to solve this problem is that every key, <em>badgeNum</em>, news a list of values rather than a single value.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict.setdefault(1234, []).append('first 1234')
&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict.setdefault(5678, []).append('first 5678')
&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict.setdefault(1234, []).append('second 1234')
&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict.setdefault(5678, []).append('second 5678')
&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict
{1234: ['first 1234', 'second 1234'], 5678: ['first 5678', 'second 5678']}
</code></pre>
<p>Another approach is to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>collections.defaultdict()</em></a> which takes a little more effort to set-up but makes it simpler (and a bit faster) to add new values:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import defaultdict
&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict = defaultdict(list)
&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict[1234].append('first 1234')
&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict[5678].append('first 5678')
&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict[1234].append('second 1234')
&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict[5678].append('second 5678')
&gt;&gt;&gt; mydict
defaultdict(&lt;class 'list'&gt;, {1234: ['first 1234', 'second 1234'], 5678: ['first 5678', 'second 5678']})
</code></pre>

<p>Solved. It was a stupid mistake. I was trying to fill the array that was global and then was clearing the array every time I received input from user by using "del myarray[:]". I declared the array just for the function and it works. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">I'm sorry, didn't get it. I'm relatively new to python and I have been reading the documentation but couldn't figure it out. So you mean if use setdefault() it'll help? Because I tried it and it didn't work.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@RahulJoshi Sorry about that, I posted the wrong snippet.  It is fixed now.  The technique is to use <i>dict.setdefault</i> or <i>collections.defaultdict</i> to create new empty lists for previously unseen keys and to the append new entries to that list.</span>
