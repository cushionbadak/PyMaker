<p>I want to read a live stream from youtube to perform some basic CV things, probably we have to somehow strip of the youtube URL to convert it in a format that might be readable by openCV like?:</p>
<p><code>cap = cv2.VideoCapture('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9OBhtLA9Ig')</code></p>
<p>has anyone done it? </p>

<p>I am sure you already know the answer by now, but I will answer for others searching the same topic. You can do this by using Pafy. First you need to 
<code>import pafy</code></p>
<p>Then add this</p>
<pre><code>url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9OBhtLA9Ig"
video = pafy.new(url)
best = video.getbest(preftype="mp4")

capture = cv2.VideoCapture()
capture.open(best.url)
</code></pre>
<p>And that should be it.</p>
