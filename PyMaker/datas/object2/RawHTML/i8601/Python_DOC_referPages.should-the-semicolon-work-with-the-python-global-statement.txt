<p>I'm a bit confused about when semicolons work in Python and when they don't. 
In Python (3.4.3) the following code generates SyntaxError: invalid syntax</p>
<pre><code>global winSeqs ; if len(winSeqs) == 0: makeWinSeqs(boardSize)
</code></pre>
<p>The (3.4.3) language reference manual section 7 says:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; A simple statement is comprised within a single logical line. Several
&gt; simple statements may occur on a single line separated by semicolons.
&gt; The syntax for simple statements is:
&gt; 
&gt; simple_stmt ::=  expression_stmt
&gt;                  | assert_stmt
&gt;                  | assignment_stmt
...
&gt;                  | global_stmt
&gt;                  | nonlocal_stmt
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is probably a bug (perhaps in the documentation) but it'd be good to know for sure.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with the use of <code>global</code>.  As the documentation states, you can combine several <strong>simple</strong> statements with semi-colons.</p>
<p>A stanza of the form <code>if ...: ...</code> is not a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">simple statement</a>.  It is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#compound-statements" rel="nofollow noreferrer">compound statement</a>. You will observe the same SyntaxError with the following code:</p>
<pre><code>x = 1; if x == 1: print("wibble")
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Great simple answer.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Arrh, makes sense. Thanks!</span>
