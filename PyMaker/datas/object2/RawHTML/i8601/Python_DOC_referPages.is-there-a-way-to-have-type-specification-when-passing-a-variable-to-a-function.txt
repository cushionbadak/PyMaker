<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>In a language like C# I must specify the type of the objects that are passed into a given function. If I have a class like so: </p>
<p><code>class Thing
{
    public static someFunc(int input)
    {
        return input * 2
    }
}</code></p>
<p>Then if I am in main I can call that function through another function by specifying the type of the variable that will be passed as an argument:</p>
<pre><code>public static otherFunc(Thing item, int num)
{
    return item.someFunc(num)
}
</code></pre>
<p>though the example is not optimal, I make it just to show that I can access functions from the Thing class within a separate function by specifying that a Thing object will be passed to that function.</p>
<p>Python does not have this level of type specification, thus I can see no way of achieving the same result. If I have a function which I defined in a class from a separate file, but I want to run it through a function where an object of that class type will be used to run that function, how can I access that class function in a separate function?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can write your code in Python (lets use separate file also) like this:</p>
<p>First.py</p>
<pre><code>class Thing:
    @staticmethod
    def someFunc(input):
        return input * 2
</code></pre>
<p>Second.py</p>
<pre><code>def otherFunc(item, num):
    return item.someFunc(num)
</code></pre>
<p>Now the call site:</p>
<p>Main.py</p>
<pre><code>from First import Thing
from Second import otherFunc

t = Thing()
otherFunc(t,2)
</code></pre>
<p>So I can't see what it is you think that Python cannot do.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You just access it. <code>item.someFunc(num)</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What you have written in <code>C#</code> can be written in exactly the same way in <code>Python</code>, just without the static type checking.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I'm with @pvg on this one. Your question really seems to be "How can I translate this code from C# to Python". In any case, your going to have to be more specific if you want a useful answer. What attempts have you made at solving this problem, and where exactly are you stuck.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you asking how to pass it or how to pass it and have the compiler verify that what you are passing is infact a <code>Thing</code> object? For the later you have <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">type hints</a>.</span>
