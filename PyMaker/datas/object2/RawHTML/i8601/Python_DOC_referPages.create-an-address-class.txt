<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm having huge problems understanding classes. I have to create an address class with the instance variables: street, city, state and zipcode and then I have to add a <code>__str__</code> method that returns a string printing the instance variables. </p>
<p>sorry! here is the code I have right now
my issue is trying to get the instance variables printed, because right now they are undefined. </p>
<pre><code>class Address:

def __init__(self, street, city, state, zipcode):
    self.street = street
    self.city = city
    self.state = state
    self.zipcode = zipcode

def get_street(self, street):
    return self.street

def get_city(self, city):
    return self.city

def get_state(self, state):
    return self.state

def get_zipcode(self, zipcode):
    return self.zipcode

def __str__(self):
    return str(self.street,self.city,self.state,self.zipcode)

street = Address(Grandview)
street.get_street
city = Address(Westland)
city.get_city
state = Address(Michigan)
state.get_state
zipcode = Address(48186)
zipcode.get_zipcode
print(street, city, state, zipcode)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You have defined the <code>class __init__(...)</code> to <strong>pass 4</strong> <code>arguments</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def __init__(self, street, city, state, zipcode):  
</code></pre>
<p>But pass only <strong>one</strong> undefined <code>Grandview</code>:</p>
<pre><code>street = Address(Grandview)
</code></pre>
<p>You have defined e.g. <code>get_street(...)</code> as a function:</p>
<pre><code>def get_street(self, street):
return self.street
</code></pre>
<p>but uses it as a <code>class attribute</code>:</p>
<pre><code>street.get_street
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Based on you code, it should be:</p>
<pre><code>class Address:

    def __init__(self, street, city, state, zipcode):
        self.street = street
        self.city = city
        self.state = state
        self.zipcode = zipcode

    def get_street(self, street):
        return self.street

    def get_city(self, city):

    def get_state(self, state):
        return self.state

    def get_zipcode(self, zipcode):
        return self.zipcode

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.street,self.city,self.state,self.zipcode)

address = Address('Grandview', 'Westland', 'Michigan', 48186)
street = address.get_street()
city = address.get_city()
state = address.get_state()
zipcode = address.get_zipcode()

print "%s, %s, %s, %s" % (street, city, state, zipcode)

<span class="comment-copy">Post your code and describe where you're stuck.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>class Address()</code> would be a good start. Can you <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/posts/42959891/edit">edit</a> your post, please?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That's a nice story, but what is your question? It sounds to me like you should be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">working through a tutorial</a>, because this site is not for tutoring you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I have added my code</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Now explain what the specific issue is with that code.</span>
