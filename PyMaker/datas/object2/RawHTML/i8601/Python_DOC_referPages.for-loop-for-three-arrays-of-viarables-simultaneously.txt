<p>I want to loop through three lists of numbers simultaneously and do calculations on each combination of variables.
So I can later store all the calculated data in a 3-dimensional dataframe.</p>
<p>I've tried:</p>
<pre><code>for (x,y,z) in [(x, y, z) for x in a for y in b for z in c]:
</code></pre>
<p>but this does not seem to work, it only performs the calculations for each value of x and y, but not z.</p>
<p>Any ideas how I can also loop through z at the same time?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>How about using zip:</p>
<pre><code>for x, y, z in zip(a, b, c):
    # Do something
</code></pre>
<h1>Update with concrete example</h1>
<pre><code>users = ['alex', 'john']
uids = [502, 501]
shells = ['bash', 'tcsh']

for user, uid, shell in zip(users, uids, shells):
    print('User: {}, UID: {}, Shell: {}'.format(user, uid, shell))
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>User: alex, UID: 502, Shell: bash
User: john, UID: 501, Shell: tcsh
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>if you want all the combinations, use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product" rel="nofollow noreferrer">itertools.product</a></p>
<pre><code>from itertools import product
for x, y, z in product([1, 2], ['A', 'B'], [3, 4]):
    print(x, y, z)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Turns out the piece of code I tried to use actually did work. Just had to enumerate all my inputs.</p>
<p><code>for (x,y,z) in [(x, y, z) for x in a for y in b for z in c]:</code></p>
<p>It's possible to use this for dataframes with even more than 3 dimensions.
The itertools.product should also work for Multi-dimensional array for-loops.</p>
<p>Thanks for the responses everyone.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">The single statement you provide works fine for me, given appropriate support.  Note that it's equivalent to the answer Pawel gives.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I don't think he wants corresponding indexes. I think he wants all variations</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This is how I understood the question. If the OP meant otherwise, then Pawel's solution should be used.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This isn't what I was looking for, ZIP takes the integer at the same place in each string. I would like every possible combination.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Have you looked at Pawel's solution?</span>
