<p>it doesn't give any suggestions of histroy. Whats happended with it?
I want to make it working as like new one . How to reset it ?</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Lots of things could be happening here, and you haven't provided much information about your setup, so all I can do is guess.</p>
<p>The easiest answer in any situation like this is always the same:
undo whatever changes you made;
restore the configs that used to work.
If you don't have backups, compare what you have now to some other machine (or login) that does work.</p>
<p>Assuming you've tried all that...</p>
<p>Arrow keys, command-completion, and history are typically provided by <a href="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GNU Readline</a> (but hardly always --- I gather Macs use something else, and I don't know if Windows can provide any of those features at all).</p>
<h2>Python configs</h2>
<p>Since Python 3.4, history in interactive mode was <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#readline-configuration" rel="nofollow noreferrer">enabled by default</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>29.13.1. Readline configuration</h3>
<p><em>Changed in version 3.4</em>:
  Activation of <code>rlcompleter</code> and history was made automatic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure you haven't <em>disabled</em> that automatic history by aliasing Python to <code>python -S</code> or anything similar.</p>
<p>Before that, a script would be named in the <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable, and that script would be executed by the interactive Python session before presenting the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> prompt.
The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/rlcompleter.html#module-rlcompleter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python 3.3 <code>rlcompleter</code> docs</a> gave an example:</p>
<pre><code>try:
    import readline
except ImportError:
    print("Module readline not available.")
else:
    import rlcompleter
    readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")
</code></pre>
<h2>GNU Readline configs</h2>
<p>It's possible GNU Readline is not enabled or is set to something bizarre.
Like Python's, the <a href="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html#SEC9" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GNU Readline config file</a> is named by an environment variable, in this case <code>INPUTRC</code>.
If that variable is not set, the default config file is <code>~/.inputrc</code> or, if that doesn't exist, <code>/etc/inputrc</code>.
(Different Unix-like distributions could have changed those defaults.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html#SEC15" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Readline history bindable commands</a> you'd want to look for are <code>previous-history</code> and <code>next-history</code>.
But if those are wrong, you'd probably notice it in more than just Python.</p>
<h2>Other options</h2>
<p>The only other likely culprit is your window manager.
I can't help there.
Window managers are more likely to <del>screw up</del> help with things like <code>Ctrl</code>, <code>Caps Lock</code>, and <code>Num Lock</code> than arrow keys, anyway.</p>
<p>Anything more in-depth than the above is <em>highly</em> unlikely to be the cause.
If you'd been fiddling with <code>xmodmap</code> or <code>loadkeys</code> (or any of the <em>many</em> other layers between a keystroke and its result inside a GUI terminal), you'd remember it.</p>
<p>Again, the easiest solution is to identify and undo the changes you made, even if that means creating a new login so you have a blank slate to compare.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Here's a good article on the subject: <a href="https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-change-from-default-to-alternative-python-version-on-debian-linux" rel="nofollow noreferrer">linuxconfig.org/â€¦</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Huh? Can you explain what's actually wrong? I'm not seeing anything obvious in what you posted except a vague reference to "history", but everything seems to be working correctly...</span>
<span class="comment-copy">To get previous command . i pressed <b>up arrow</b> . but it gave me <b>^[[A</b> . This is odd .</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Are you running a different version of Python now, or on a different machine?  What was "the new [old?] one"?  It sounds like you're expecting GNU Readline to handle keyboard input (history, completion, etc.).  That's usually done in your startup file.  Do you have the <code>PYTHONSTARTUP</code> environment variable set?  If so, does it name a file?  What's in that file?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No i dont have <b>PYTHONSTARTUP</b> enviroment variable set ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Its saying <b>module readline not available</b>. Should i have to install it through <b>pip</b> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@deepak:  How would I know?  You still haven't provided basic info like what OS you're running, or what you were doing when Python suddenly stopped working.  Maybe you've got a custom Python installation --- who knows?  That said, <a href="https://docs.python.org/4/library/readline.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>readline</code></a> is part of the standard library, so if you can't <code>import readline</code>, then you have much bigger problems than arrow keys.  (Or maybe your system, whatever it is, uses <code>libedit</code> instead?)  If you're convinced your distro has shipped an incomplete Standard Library (bloody unlikely), file a bug with them.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i am running fedora24 x64 workstation . And i tried to reinstall python from official site of python thats it . nothing else. since that time this error is occuring.</span>
