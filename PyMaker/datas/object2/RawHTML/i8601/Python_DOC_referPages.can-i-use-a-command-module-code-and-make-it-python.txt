<p>Is there a way to access a library that I can access on command line on python that is connected that library</p>
<p>One example would be</p>
<pre><code>cd Desktop/GoPiGo/Software/Python/Examples/GPS_Bot/
sudo python gps.py  
</code></pre>
<p>Because I know that that works on the command line I don't know how to adapt it to python</p>
<p>Any websites or tutorials you link would be welcome as I am a fledgling programmer and have just started learning about the command line.</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you want to run commands to the console, you have to use <code>subprocess</code>.</p>
<p>You must first import the modules, then run the command. 
You are using the system's commands, so you must import <code>sys</code> as well.</p>
<p>Let me know if this works.</p>
<pre><code>import subprocess
    import sys
    process = subprocess.Popen(['cd', 'Desktop/GoPiGo/Software/Python/Examples/GPS_Bot/', 'sudo', 'python', 'gps.py"'])
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Look into <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html</a></p>
<p>For example, you can run the command (I have not tested this particular usage):  </p>
<pre><code>subprocess.check_call(['cd', 'Desktop/GoPiGo/Software/Python/Examples/GPS_Bot/', 'sudo', 'python', 'gps.py'], shell=True)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">Sort of unclear on what you want, are you trying to execute shell commands through python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">yes the sudo python.GPS command in the library Desktop/GoPiGo/Software/Python/Examples/GPS_Bot/</span>
