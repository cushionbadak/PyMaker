<p>I have tried the <code>schedule</code> library however my code stalls sometimes which also means the schedule code stalls. </p>
<pre><code>import schedule
import time
import app

schedule.every(3).seconds.do(app.run)
while 1:
    try:
        schedule.run_pending()
    except Exception as e:
        print e
        pass
</code></pre>
<p><code>app.run</code> is the script, it using Queues and Threads to request exchange data. One of the exchanges randomly throws an error and because the of threading (I think) the code goes into a state of limbo. I can't seem to fix the bug, but a dirty fix to the problem would be force run the script every x time (in my case I want 10 seconds) Any ideas ? </p>

<p>Besides the obvious way (have a thread that with <code>while True:</code> containing <code>action()</code> and <code>sleep(10)</code>), you can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#timer-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">threading.Timer</a> or the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html#module-sched" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sched module</a>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Bloody genius, thank you</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Hi @Raymond Hettinger sorry after considering what you said I can't actually figure out how to write the script. How would would construct the code using threads to solve my problem ?</span>
