<p>I am studying python, both 3. and 2.  I started a few days ago.
I want to know the differences between site module and interpreter.
I got this question from </p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19747371/python-exit-commands-why-so-many-and-when-should-each-be-used">Python exit commands - why so many and when should each be used?</a></p>
<p>Those explanations are very clear but it's still hard to me.</p>

<p>I assume you are stuck on understanding: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nevertheless, quit should not be used in production code. This is
  because it only works if the site module is loaded. Instead, this
  function should only be used in the interpreter."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, what that is saying is that <code>quit</code> is a part of a module loaded in the python interpreter. That module's name, is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">site</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly, the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">python interpreter</a></strong> is what you use to run python scripts or environments. It interprets python commands. For example, if you write <code>a = 1</code> in a script or python environment, the interpreter takes that command and executes it without compiling it. (If it was a language like c you would need to compile the script before you run it).</p>
<p>Secondly, a <strong><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">module</a></strong> is a pre-written file that can define functions, classes and variables. When you write <code>import numpy</code> into python, you are importing the module, numpy. Therefore when they say "this only works if the site module is loaded", that means that <code>import site</code> must be executed. </p>
<p>When you start a python interpreter (by typing <code>python</code> into your command shell), it automatically imports <code>site</code>, which has <code>sys</code>, <code>venv</code> and <code>main</code> etc. which are all required to run an active interpreter session.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If I am understanding your question correctly,<code>site</code> is a module in Python. <em>A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.</em> In order to use the functions (for ex: <code>exit()</code> or <code>quit()</code>, you need to import the <code>site</code> module as those respective functions are defined in there.</p>
<p><em>The Python</em> <code>interpreter</code> <em>is the program that reads and executes Python code. This includes source code, pre-compiled code, scripts</em> - in this case you reference, you would need to import the <code>site</code> module into your current Python <code>interpreter</code> session, in order to use say <code>exit()</code> or <code>quit()</code> in that given session.</p>
<p>So, the process of this particular question would be:<br/>
* Activate the Python interpreter by typing into your respective terminal the version of Python you have installed on your computer, ex. <code>python3</code>.<br/>
* In the Python interpreter, type <code>import site</code><p></p>
<p>Hope that helps Hwan.</p>
