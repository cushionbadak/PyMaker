<p>I am doing a python project.I opened a new csv files and its contents  are</p>
<pre><code> A     |  B

  1.  200 | 201   
  2.  200 | 202

<p>And what I am doing is...</p>
<pre><code>def csvvalidation(readers):
    for row in readers:
        print row
def checkduplicationcsv(reader):
    datalist = []
    for row in reader:
        print row
        content = list(row[i] for i in range(0,3))
        datalist.append(content)     
with open("new.csv", "rb") as infile:
    reader = csv.reader(infile)
    first_row = next(reader, None)  # skip the headers
    checkduplicationcsv(reader)
    csvvalidation(reader)
</code></pre>
<p>The problem is I can print the values only one time.The <code>csvvalidation()</code> function reader is not working.How can I use the reader object multiple times.I can't print its row values.What can I do?Please give me a solution.And I am not aware of <code>seek()</code> (I think that its pointing to the same reader again).So I tried <code>infile.seek(0)</code> after the first function but no use.nothing happens</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>The reader is wrapped around a file pointer, and when that is used up, it's used up. Don't use it multiple times, use it once and then work with the array of data you read:</p>
<pre><code>with open("new.csv", "rb") as infile:
    reader = csv.reader(infile)
    first_row = next(reader, None)  # skip the headers
    data = list(reader)             # read everything else into a list of rows

checkduplicationcsv(data)
csvvalidation(data)
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, your two functions will work without modification (unless they were already broken), because a list, a file, and a csv reader are all "iterables" that can  be iterated over. Ain't Python grand...</p>

<p>It works. You should check your code again :) </p>
<pre><code>with open("new.csv", "rb") as infile:
    reader = csv.reader(infile)
    first_row = next(reader, None)  
    checkduplicationcsv(reader)
    infile.seek(0)        # &lt;- Add infile.seek(0)
    csvvalidation(reader)

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you cannot read the whole file into memory you can create two readers by means of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.tee" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>tee</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>from itertools import tee
with open("new.csv", "rb") as infile:
    reader = csv.reader(infile)
    first_row = next(reader, None)  # skip the headers
    reader1, reader2 = tee(reader, 2)
    checkduplicationcsv(reader1)
    csvvalidation(reader2)

<span class="comment-copy">why this means data = list(reader)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It will read up everything in the file. Try it. Or look up <code>list()</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your answer.without using list can I work with it??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've no idea how to answer that. Why don't you want to use a list? What do you want to do instead?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I told u i tried infile.seek(0).but its not working</span>
<span class="comment-copy">the solution is working</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just Look into my question I tried this method but its not working.then I thought the problem that may be the way of opening the file.I am not use this method to open a file. file = open('new.csv', 'rb').So i thought may be this is the problem</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@bobmarti This works for me, too. Not sure why it's not working for you.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@glibdud I don't know why it is not working for me</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If i use mutple reader it will affect on my excecution time????</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Why we use 2 readers???That is need in this case???\</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Note, you may lose some functionality with tee, for example: <code>'itertools.tee' object has no attribute 'line_num'</code></span>
