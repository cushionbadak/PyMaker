<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>i want to display numbers in scientific notation: </p>
<pre><code>-407.45833
</code></pre>
<p>So far i used this:</p>
<pre><code>        i = '%E' % Decimal(i)
</code></pre>
<p>result:</p>
<pre><code>-4.074583E+02
</code></pre>
<p>now my question: how can i add one more digit so it looks like this:?</p>
<pre><code>-4.074583E+002 
</code></pre>
<p>I know i should find my answer in the tables from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Python string formatting</a> to select the proper format layout, but i cant find it. Can someone tell me the result and where to find it please?</p>

<p>There's unfortunately not any direct way using string formatting to have three digits following the <code>+</code>. A easy method to replace it is to use this since what we know is that is exponential forms are all stored as strings, so all the string methods will work on it.</p>
<p>I wrote a little function that takes a regular scientific notation and returns a formatted notation with three digits after the <code>+</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from decimal import Decimal
def pretty(notation, n):
    if '+' in notation:
        return "+".join([notation.split('+')[0],notation.split('+')[1].zfill(n)])
    return "-".join([notation.split('-')[0],notation.split('-')[1].zfill(n)])

i = '%E' % Decimal(-407.45833)
print(pretty(i,3)) # leave three digits
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't believe there's a function for that...but you can do it manually:(</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@abccd if i change this "%.2E" i get "4.07E+02". i did hope there is something similar for the digits at the end</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, unfortunately not, but why did you need to do that? What happens if it's E+0123? Now there's four digits....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">i have to fill a text document with numbers like that and they have to have this specific format</span>
<span class="comment-copy">have you looked at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9911741/1635109">this</a> ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">works perfectly! Thank you!</span>
