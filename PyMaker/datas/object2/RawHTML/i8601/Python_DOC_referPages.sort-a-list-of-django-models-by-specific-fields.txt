<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a list of Django objects, all from the same class and those objects are not saved in the DB. 
I want to sort the list (again, a list of models) by a specific field in that class.
How can I do that?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>so this is what I did and it worked for me:</p>
<p>list_of_models = sorted(list_of_models , key = lambda x: x.object.time)</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=list.sort#list.sort" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sort()</code></a> with a <code>key</code> function????</span>
<span class="comment-copy">you mean the python sort?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If they're not saved in the db, that's the only option.</span>
