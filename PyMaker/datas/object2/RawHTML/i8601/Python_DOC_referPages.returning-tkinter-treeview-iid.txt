<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a treeview and have inserted some data into it as shown below.</p>
<pre><code>self.tree.insert('', 'end', iid="test1", text="test a", values=("data1", "data2"))
</code></pre>
<p>This adds an entry to the end of the treeview with text "test a" and column values of "data1" and "data2".</p>
<p>The iid has been set to "test1".</p>
<p>I would like to return the value of iid of an item in the treeview so that I can use it for some other function (I will be storing a file path in this iid)</p>
<p>I tried using treeview.item() and this returned the following dictionary without the iid:</p>
<pre><code>{'version': 'data1', 'author': 'data2'}
</code></pre>
<p>(where version and author are the column headings)</p>
<p>So my question: is there a simple way to return the iid of a given row/entry to the treeview?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>To get  the <code>iid</code> you can use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>identify()</code></a> function:</p>
<pre><code>tree.identify(event.x, event.y) # item at row "x" and column "y"
</code></pre>
<p>The  <code>iid</code>  argument stands for <em>item identifier</em> which is unique for each item, and you can give it the value you want.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Learning Python, found no answer to this question here that I liked, so I finally figured out what I wanted and thought I would post what I found. iid = tree.focus() returns the information requested.</p>
<p>in my treeview i added this code:</p>
<pre><code>for item in tree.selection():
    item_child = tree.get_children(item)
    item = tree.item(item)
    iid = tree.focus()
    print ("iid = ", iid, "Item = ", item, "Child iid's =", item_child)
</code></pre>
<p>this is my result from the code:</p>
<p><code>{'text': 'TRAINS', 'image': '', 'values': '', 'open': 0, 'tags': ['m']}
iid =  1 Item =  {'text': 'TRAINS', 'image': '', 'values': '', 'open': 0, 'tags': ['m']} Child iid's = ('8', '9', '10')</code></p>
<p>Notice at the beginning of line two of the result the iid is listed as "1" which is the correct iid for the item. All treeview items I select returned the correct iid.</p>
<p>Hope this helps the next person a little. </p>

<span class="comment-copy">Item selected &gt; Press a run button &gt; the iid is used (it is a file path) to start some subprocess.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">use <code>tree.identify(event.x, event.y)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">@BillalBEGUERADJ It looks like I may have something working along the same lines as that. Thanks. Do you know what <code>iid</code> stands for?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Fantastic, thanks. If you'd like to submit your comments as an answer I'll happily accept it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">this is exactly the same question but an error is produced, any idea why? <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43673883/python-who-can-tell-me-why-this-wont-work-example-provided" title="python who can tell me why this wont work example provided">stackoverflow.com/questions/43673883/â€¦</a>?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I may answer you by  the end of the day, I am busy right now @new_to_coding</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thank you for your response but don't worry about it, someone has responded with a working solution, which you may want to check out anyway, take care</span>
