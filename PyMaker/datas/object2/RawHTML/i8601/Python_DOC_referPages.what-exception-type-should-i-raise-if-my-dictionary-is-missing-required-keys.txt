<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I am testing that <code>data</code> (dictionary), used in <em>Django's</em> <code>render(request, url, data)</code>, has some required keys. I will raise an exception if the required keys are missing. What exception type is best suited for this?</p>
<p>Is there a better way to think about this?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>For consistency with regular dicts, I would think a <code>KeyError</code> would be appropriate</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'foo': 'bar'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; d[5]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#1&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    d[5]
KeyError: 5

<p>Raised when a mapping (dictionary) key is not found in the set of existing keys.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Maybe a <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/KeyError" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>KeyError</code></a> will fit your needs.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">What is wrong with <code>KeyError</code>? Moreover python will do the job of throwing the exception. You need to catch it.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nothing wrong with <code>KeyError</code>. I was stuck thinking about it differently and I couldn't see the obvious. Thanks.</span>
