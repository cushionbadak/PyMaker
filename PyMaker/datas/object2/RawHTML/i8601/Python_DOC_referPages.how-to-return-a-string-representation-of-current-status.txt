<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have to create a function that returns a string representation of the current status that looks like:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Alt = 4.00 Vel = 0.00 Fuel = 0 Str = 4
</code></pre>
<p>I have to match the format exactly (2 decimal places, spacing, etc)</p>
<pre><code>def current_status():
    global altitude
    global velocity
    global fuel
    global strength
    global gravity
    altitude="{0:.2f}".format(altitude)
    velocity="{0:.2f}".format(velocity)
    string=("Alt =",altitude, "Vel =",velocity,"Fuel =",fuel,"Str =",strength)
    return str(string)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the <code>str.format()</code> method, which uses a string with special <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">replacement fields</a> in it that specify how format the data. </p>
<p>You don't have to declare all those variables <code>global</code>—although it doesn't hurt—because that will be assumed in the function automatically since none of them are defined within it and only have their current values referenced.</p>
<pre><code># Define some global variables for testing.
altitude = 4.
velocity = 0.
fuel = 0
strength = 0
gravity = 42

def current_status():
    return "Alt = {:02.2f}, Vel = {:02.2f}, Fuel = {:,d}, Str = {:,d}".format(
                                                        altitude, velocity, fuel, strength)

# Try it out.
print(current_status())
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="lang-none prettyprint-override"><code>Alt = 4.00, Vel = 0.00, Fuel = 0, Str = 0
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You informed us of what your homework assignment is and you showed us some code. Do you intend to ask a question? Presumably the code doesn't do what you want -- but how? If you want help, you need to explain exactly what it is that you need help on. We can't read your mind.</span>
