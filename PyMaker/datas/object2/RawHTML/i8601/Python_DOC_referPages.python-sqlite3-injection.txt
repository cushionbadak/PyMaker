<p>I was wondering in my program for python I have purposely made it so I can use injection in my program. If I try to use this <code>enter a name: name; DROP TABLE test;</code> it does not work and enters it normally. If I am using <code>enter a name: name' DROP TABLE test;</code> it comes up with 
where it says enter a name it is obviously a variable.</p>
<pre><code>c.execute("INSERT INTO test VALUES('%s')" % test)
sqlite3.OperationalError: near "DROP": syntax error
</code></pre>
<p>and if I use </p>
<pre><code>enter name: test'"DROP TABLE test;"

c.execute("INSERT INTO test VALUES('%s')" % test)
sqlite3.OperationalError: near ""DROP TABLE test;"": syntax error
</code></pre>
<p>I only want to know how to so I can try it out in my programs only and to prevent against it(I know you should use ?)</p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The VALUES clause needs a closing parenthesis, so you need to enter something like this:</p>
<pre>
name'); DROP TABLE test; --
</pre>
<p>(The <code>--</code> starts a comment, to prevent the final <code>')</code> in the original SQL statement from being interpreted.)</p>
<p>And Python's <code>sqlite3.Cursor.execute()</code> executes only a single statement, so this kind of injection does not work. Your program would need to use <code>executescript()</code> instead.<br/>
(But if you have a SELECT, you can use this to suppress any following filter conditions, such as <code>AND password='...'</code>.)</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Did you read his question, Klaus? He <b>wants</b> this program to be injectable, he did it deliberately.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you very much, it works. now to guard against it in every way possible.</span>
