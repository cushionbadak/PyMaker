<p>As I understand it, the python language reference is written in extended BNF format. While looking at the documentation for function definitions I noticed that the spec doesn't seem to support the usage of trailing *args or **kwargs parameters.</p>
<pre><code>parameter_list ::=  (defparameter ",")*
                    | "*" [parameter] ("," defparameter)* ["," " ** " parameter]
                    | "**" parameter
                    | defparameter [","] )
</code></pre>
<p>See: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-defparameter" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#grammar-token-defparameter</a></p>
<p>And yet when I do a function def like so:</p>
<pre><code>def func(arg1, *args, **args):
</code></pre>
<p>The python interpreter considers it to be legal. </p>
<p>What am I missing? From the spec it appears that you must have the * at the beginning of the function definition before any other parameters. </p>

<p>It appears to be a documentation bug for which <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue22942" rel="nofollow">an issue</a> has been raised.</p>
<p>I think the definitions in the documentation are slightly simplified in order to be easier to read.  The "real" definition is given in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html" rel="nofollow">full grammar specification</a>:</p>
<pre><code>funcdef: 'def' NAME parameters ['-&gt;' test] ':' suite
parameters: '(' [typedargslist] ')'
typedargslist: (tfpdef ['=' test] (',' tfpdef ['=' test])* [','
       ['*' [tfpdef] (',' tfpdef ['=' test])* [',' '**' tfpdef] | '**' tfpdef]]
     |  '*' [tfpdef] (',' tfpdef ['=' test])* [',' '**' tfpdef] | '**' tfpdef)
tfpdef: NAME [':' test]
</code></pre>
<p>This is more difficult to read but appears to correctly allow varargs with or without ordinary arguments.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">I don't understand your question.  It says <code>"*" [parameter]</code> and <code>"**" parameter</code> right there.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">right but doesn't the parameter_list spec mean that a parameter list is either a list of parameters OR a * followed by a list of parameters, OR ** parameter, OR a single parameter. In which case there is no where that a parameter list may be parameters followed by *identifier or parameters followed by **kwargs etc.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">There's a note there that says (about something different) "... this is a syntactic restriction that is not expressed by the grammar."  It would seem that in your case this is a syntactic flexibility/allowance that s not expressed by the grammar.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you for the help. I didn't know about the issue tracker!</span>
