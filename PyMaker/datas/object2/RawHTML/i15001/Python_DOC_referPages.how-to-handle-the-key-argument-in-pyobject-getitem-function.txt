<p>I am writing a <code>python</code> module from a c library of my own, I need to know how to handle the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/object.html#c.PyObject_GetItem" rel="nofollow"><code>PyObject_GetItem()</code></a> function, specifically the <code>key</code> argument, the documentation is not very helpful and I have seen an example where the solution is</p>
<pre><code>Py_hash_t hash;

hash = PyObject_Hash(key);
</code></pre>
<p>but the problem is, that I would like to be able to know whether <code>key</code> is a string or an integer.</p>
<p>I could use the <code>PyObject_Hash()</code> methdod if there is a way to differentitate a string key from an integer key since I can also compute the hash value corresponding to the string using the Python hash function, but i'd rather not do that because I already have a binary search implemented on the list that I am trying to be able to access via subscripting in python.</p>
<p>I also tried</p>
<pre><code>PyArg_ParseTuple(key, "i", ...);
</code></pre>
<p>and for the string to check which one succeeds, but then the interpreter throws an exception because the <code>key</code> is not a tuple.</p>

<p>I just found out the way to do it properly, there is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/unicode.html" rel="nofollow"><code>PyUnicode_Check()</code></a> macro that takes a single <code>PyObject</code> parameter and returns <code>0</code> if the object is not a <code>unicode</code> object, so it returns <code>0</code> for the <code>int</code> key, and non-zero for the string key. </p>
<p>That was exactly what I needed since now I can proceed to extract the text and perform a binary search in my list.</p>
<p>Also, there is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html" rel="nofollow"><code>PyObject_TypeCheck()</code></a> function which returns the type of an object, very useful in this case too.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Why do you need to know the type? What if it's neither?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@IgnacioVazquez-Abrams because I want to provide two methods to fetch the elements, one by index and by element name, there is a name associated with each one, and it's really important to use it to be able to access the element.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">How would you do it in Python? Look for appropriate C-api equivalents to the Python tools you would use.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@user2357112 I have no idea because i have limited python knowledge. That's why I am asking, and that's why initially I didn't add the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/c">c</a> tag to the question.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Could u pls show how u parsed the pyobject u got</span>
