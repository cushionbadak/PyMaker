<p>Hi I don't understand what I am doing, please help! There seems to be an error with the average speed! </p>
<pre><code>What is the distance from one of the censor to the other?&gt;&gt;70
How long did it take you to get past the monitored section in seconds?7
Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>I don't know why! Basically I've been spending so long on this and that one bit is making me lag behind. I've probably spent about more than an hour just looking at what is wrong with the code.</p>
<pre><code>import re
Distance = ""
TimeTaken = ""
AverageSpeed = ""

def Distance():
    Distance == input("What is the distance from one of the censor to the other?&gt;&gt;")
    if Distance == int == True:
        print(Distance)
    if Distance == int == False:
        print("Write only numbers")
Distance()

def TimeTaken():
    TimeTaken == input("How long did it take you to get past the monitored section in seconds?")
    if TimeTaken == int == True:
        print(TimeTaken)
    if TimeTaken == int == False:
        print("Write only numbers")
TimeTaken()

def AverageSpeed():
  AverageSpeed = print("Your speed is",(Distance / TimeTaken), "in metres per second")
AverageSpeed()

<p>Oh boy, your code is <em>very far away</em> from working.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You cannot define functions and variables with the same name; <code>Distance</code> and <code>TimeTaken</code> are the functions, because you defined those later.</p>
<p>Use lower-case variable names instead, return the result from the function and store that result in the variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that <em>printing</em> is not the same thing as returning; <code>print()</code> always returns <code>None</code>, after writing output to your terminal or console.</p></li>
<li><p>You are also using <code>==</code> (equality testing) where you should use <code>=</code> (assignment). Equality testing is an expression; it returns a result (<code>True</code> or <code>False</code>), it doesn't affect the name you are comparing with.</p></li>
<li><p>You are not correctly testing the input for numbers. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23294658/asking-the-user-for-input-until-they-give-a-valid-response">Asking the user for input until they give a valid response</a> for how to properly handle user responses, including conversions to another type. The expression <code>Distance == int == True</code> is never going to be true because even if <code>Distance</code> was containing the user input, a string value is never going to be equal to the <code>int</code> type, and the <code>int</code> type is never going to be equal to <code>True</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Minor point: you are importing <code>re</code> but never use it. You can safely remove the <code>import re</code> line.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As such, there are too many issues here; if I were to fix them all I'd be doing your homework for you. I suggest you break down your problems into <em>smaller programs</em>. Do <strong>one thing at a time</strong>. Make that work first. Then move to the next.
