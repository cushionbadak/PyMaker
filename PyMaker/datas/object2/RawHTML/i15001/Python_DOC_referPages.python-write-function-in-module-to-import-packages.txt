<p>I am trying to write a function, which is itself loaded, to quickly import a bunch of modules globally. </p>
<p>I thought that, essentially, loaded modules could be treated as variables so I tried:</p>
<pre><code>def loadMods():
    global np
    import numpy as np
</code></pre>
<p>and when I loaded numpy (calling np) there was no problem. </p>
<p>What I then did was to create a separate .py file called loadTest containing</p>
<pre><code># loadTest module
# coding: utf-8

def loadMod():
     global np
     import numpy as np
</code></pre>
<p>Then attempted to import numpy using this .py file in python (2.7):</p>
<pre><code>import loadTest
loadTest.loadMod()
</code></pre>
<p>but now when attempting calling np I get</p>
<pre><code>File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name 'np' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>Why does this occur? Any help or alternative ways of doing this would be much appreciated. Thanks a bunch :)</p>

<p>Instead of making a function to do this, why not make another module?  You could name it something like <code>modules.py</code> and put all of your imports in there:</p>
<pre><code>import numpy as np
import os
import sys
...
</code></pre>
<p>Then, all you need to do is a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#grammar-token-import_stmt" rel="nofollow">wildcard import</a>:</p>
<pre><code>from modules import *
</code></pre>
<p>and everything will be made available.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You must first define <code>np</code> like that.</p>
<p>In <code>loadTest</code>:</p>
<pre><code>np=None
</code></pre>
<p>In somewhere other</p>
<pre><code>import loadTest
loadTest.loadMod()
np=loadTest.np
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">All you've done is to make <code>np</code> available inside your <code>loadTest</code> module, which doesn't really help at all.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thats kind of what I was expecting. Thanks for the clarification :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks so much!!! Don't know why I didn't think of this :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This won't work. Each module's global namespace is separate, and so the <code>global</code> statement in <code>loadMod</code> will only ever write the <code>np</code> name in its own module.</span>
