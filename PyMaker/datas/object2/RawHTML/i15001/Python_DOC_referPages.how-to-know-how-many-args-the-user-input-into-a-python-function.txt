<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I tried to find a simple solution to know how many arguments have the user input into the *args of a Python function but to no avail. So I guess it would be faster to ask the experts here.</p>
<p>Say:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(*args):
    for arg in args:
        print "we have:", arg
</code></pre>
<p>So is there a way to know that if the user does <code>foo(1,2,3,4)</code> we know that he/she has inputted 4 arguments?</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention and help!</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len" rel="nofollow"><code>len</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>In [1]: def foo(*args):
   ...:     print(type(args))
   ...:     print(len(args))
   ...:     

In [2]: foo(1, 2, 3, 4)
&lt;class 'tuple'&gt;
4
</code></pre>
<p>The type of <code>args</code> can be found out with the built-in function <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type" rel="nofollow"><code>type</code></a>.</p>

<p>Since <code>args</code> is probably a sequence or a collection, you could just use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#len" rel="nofollow"><code>len()</code></a> to get the number of items.  </p>
<pre><code>def foo(*args):
    print "we have", len(args), "args"
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I think that is as simple as <code>len(args)</code> because the <code>args</code> is nothing but a tuple so you can apply other operations as well which are applicable to tuples.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Simply <code>len(args)</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>len(args)</code> should work since <code>args</code> is a normal tuple.</span>
