<p>I need to do this, and I have come up with this for adding:</p>
<pre><code>import random
mynos = []

print ("First, we'll do some addition")

for counter in range (0,2):
      mynumber = random.randint(1,20)
      mynos.append(mynumber)
print(mynos)

the_answer = sum(mynos)
#print(the_answer) (^^^)

player_answer =int(input("What is the answer?"))

def main():
      if player_answer is the_answer:
            print ("Correct! Well done!")
            print ("You scored 1 out of 10 so far!")
            print ("Good job!")
      else:
            print ("Incorrect! You scored null points!")
            print ("You have zero out of 10 so far!")
            exit()

main()
</code></pre>
<p>That was the adding part of the program, but instead of using <code>sum</code> is there anything to use for subtracting the two randomly generated numbers in <code>mynos</code>?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>If you only ever have 2 integers, just use subtraction on the individual elements:</p>
<pre><code>the_answer = mynos[0] - mynos[1]
</code></pre>
<p>The 'functional' way to subtract numbers in a sequence is to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce" rel="nofollow"><code>reduce()</code> function</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import operator
try:
    # Python 3 moved reduce to the functools module
    from functools import reduce
except ImportError:
    pass

the_answer = reduce(operator.sub, mynos)
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.sub" rel="nofollow"><code>operator.sub()</code> function</a> stands in for the <code>-</code> operator in that case.</p>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">The problem here is that with <code>sum</code> the order of the elements do not matter. With subtraction, the ordering of the elements <b>will</b>  affect the result. Perhaps a manual subtraction command is the right way to go here.</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>import operator; reduce(operator.sub, mynos)</code>  Is it only ever two numbers? Why not use distinct variables then?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">May be add abs(n) to the result. If it does not want to show negative result and just the difference between two.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@planet260: I think I know what exercise the OP is trying to complete; there are a few dozen related questions going round at the moment. They don't care about absolute results. Next up: multiplication and division.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@planet260 - true - but <code>difference</code> is not the same as <code>subtraction</code>. This might be the case, but it needs to be verified with the OP.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks for your help.. my program works just fine now!</span>
