<p>I am writing some code to do this:
fill an array with numbers from 0 to 9 and then put the ones smaller than 5 at the end of it. My code is this:</p>
<pre><code>    print ("give n: ")
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        num = 0
        print ("give a number from 0 to 9 ")
        num = int(input())
        while (num &gt; 9 and num &lt; 0):
            print ("only from 0 to 9")
            num = int(input())
        a.append(num)
    tmp = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if (a[i]&lt;5):
            tmp = a[i]
            a[i] = a[i+1]
            a[i+1] = tmp
    for i in range(n):
        print a[i]
</code></pre>
<p>My problem is that when i run it, the loop that checks if a number is from 0 to 9 is ignored if i give anything else and it passes it to the array and that it gives me an error on line 16 (a[i] = a[i+1]). Thanks in advance!</p>

Add <code>import pdb</code> and then put <code>pdb.set_trace()</code> where you want the debugger to break.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Hint: name a number that is both greater than nine and less than zero.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Not related, but you don't need a temp variable to swap in Python; you can just do <code>a[i], a[i+1] = a[i+1], a[i]</code>. Note also though that this won't really sort your list as you want.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">@Milind, that will loop for numbers between 0 and 9, and not loop for everything else, which is the opposite of the desired behavior.</span>
