<p>How can I multiply everything in my list by a number or how can I just apply a random function to my elements?
I have no idea how to do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>list comprehension:<br/>
<code>y = [x*2 for x in l]</code><br/>
lambda function:<br/>
<code>y = map(lambda for x: x * 5, in l)</code><br/>
looping each element of the list:<br/>
<code>for x in l:</code></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>There are hundreds of ways to achieve this. To get each element of the list you can use the following:</p>
<pre><code>for element in list:
    print element
    function(element)
    print element * 4
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>My mistake, i meant through decimals, my question was not clear enough. I'm running a function F through all the elements in my list but it is only going through the whole numbers in the list but i want it to run through decimals as well.
x = f(y) for y in x:
and my list is x = [0,2] but i need it to run through the decimal values as well.</p>
