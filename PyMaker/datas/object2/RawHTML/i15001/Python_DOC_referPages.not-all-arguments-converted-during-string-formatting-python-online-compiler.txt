<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>So this morning, after finishing some school work I decided I wanted to make a joke app type 'thing' for my friends to check out, so i set out to program a little "Desktop Virtual Assistant", now it isn't as easy as I thought it would be in fact I have tried this several times and failed or given up every time, well not this time. So when I started to make the naming function of it I get this error "not all arguments converted during string formatting"</p>
<p>and this is my code.</p>
<pre><code>def start():
    print("Welcome to your Destop Virtual Assistant")
    name = input("Please give me a name.")
    print("My name is now &gt;&gt;&gt;" %name)
start()
</code></pre>
<p>Please help</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can use the string <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow"><code>format()</code></a> method.</p>
<pre><code>def start():
    print("Welcome to your Destop Virtual Assistant")    
    name = input("Please give me a name.")
    print("My name is now &gt;&gt;&gt; {}".format(name))
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can just use the <code>+</code> operator since you are concatenating two strings. </p>
<pre><code>print("My name is now &gt;&gt;&gt; " + name)
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>print("My name is now &gt;&gt;&gt; ", name)
</code></pre>
<p>If you'd like to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-examples" rel="nofollow">string formatting</a> do it like this:</p>
<pre><code>print("My name is now &gt;&gt;&gt; {}".format(name))
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">thanks, I completely forgot you could simply add variable to it. atleast without getting an error.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Your are welcome, Glad I could help.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">That gave me a syntax error</span>
<span class="comment-copy">With comma and without percent sign? In Python 3 it works.</span>
