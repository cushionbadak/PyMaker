<p>I am quite new to python, I have built some applications in python with CGI and I found cgi is much easier compare to a framework as i have full control on everything.
Tried to build a web api through below module but it end up with a web page rather than an api.
Import cgi
Import cgitb</p>
<p>I would like to create a web api, as I am familiar with cgi i would like to create it (web api) through python cgi,I have been looking for a good documentation but i dint find any. It would be helpful if someone can give me a clue. I really appreciate your help.</p>

<p>CGI applications are nothing but backend of HTTP kind protocol, so I guess you could naturally build REST API on top of it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer</a></p>
<p>Also python have good build-in support for HTTP for better understanding from inside (in case u like to keep control on everything): <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#module-http.server" rel="nofollow">https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#module-http.server</a></p>
<p>Anyway, when your getting better in it your best bet to switch on a framework like these: <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.djangoproject.com/</a> <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/</a></p>

<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, the grammar is fixed as good as I can</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thanks @Mux for your quick answer,I will have a look at REST in Python and see if i can intergrate cgi with it.</span>
