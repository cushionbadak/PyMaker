<p>Hello I'm wondering how to make a dictionary that will not count the word 'the' or definitely remove it from the dictionary so i came up in this code:</p>
<pre><code>counts = dict()
print('Enter a line of text:')
line = input('')
words = line.split()
print('Words:', words)
print('counting...')
for word in words :
    if words != 'the':
        counts[word]= counts.get(word,0)+1
    else:
        counts[word] = counts.get(word,0)
print('Counts', counts)
</code></pre>
<p>can you help me to make it right?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>While @Steve's answer is correct, the code can be a bit prettified and simplified:</p>
<pre><code>from collections import Counter

line = input('Enter a line of text:')
words = line.split()

print('Words:', words)
print('counting...')

c = Counter(words)
del c['the'] # remove 'the' key from counter

print('Counts', dict(c))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Why not just this? :</p>
<pre><code>counts = dict()
print('Enter a line of text:')
line = input('')
words = line.split()
print('Words:', words)
print('counting...')
for word in words :
    if word != 'the':
        counts[word]= counts.get(word,0)+1
print('Counts', counts)
</code></pre>
</div>
<span class="comment-copy">Change <code>words</code> to <code>word</code> in <code>if words != 'the':</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Oops. Sorry that I missed that 'words' should be 'word' in the conditional. - is that actually your only problem?  I think there's still no reason for the 'else' clause, but maybe I don't know what you're trying to do when you see 'the'.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">it still counts the word 'the'</span>
<span class="comment-copy">oh i see i've put the variable instead of the element's name</span>
<span class="comment-copy">It seems you were just trying to do something with 'the'. My change was to just ignore 'the' completely. - I don't know what you're talking about now.  What is "the element's name"? - Your code seemed just fine as is for counting words.  You might want to lowercase each word if you don't want capitalization to matter.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In <code>if words != 'the':</code>, <code>words</code> will never equal <code>"the"</code> as <code>words</code> is a list.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Ha!  You're right.  That's just a typeo from the OP that I retained.  I didn't try this code...I assumed it was working except that 'the' was mishandled.  @Jansen, was this part of your problem all along?  Sorry I missed that logic error.</span>
