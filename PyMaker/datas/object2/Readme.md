## What are these huge data files?

We have collected stackoverflow questions that meet the following criteria:
* The question must have at least one answer.
* The entire question-answer webpage should have at least one link to the "docs.python.org/3/" link. This criterion will be met if comments alone have links to python3 documents.

## WARNING

The virus detection program can detect that some files in this compressed data file contain malicious code. It is true that there is code in this data that can act as a malicious program, but it is just a code snippet written with the "stackoverflow.com" question.

For example, the question "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55086671/what-does-this-python-program-do-was-it-a-rat" contains python code that acts as a backdoor.
