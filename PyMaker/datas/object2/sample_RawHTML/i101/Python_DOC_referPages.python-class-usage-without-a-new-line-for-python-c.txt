<p>When defining a class in Python, why does the class usage need to be in a new line? This becomes a bit annoying when trying to run python programs from a string (<code>python -c '....'</code>) because I can't define and use the class on the same line. Is there a way to achieve this?</p>
<p>For example, the following fails:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat class_play.py
class ClassA(): pass; a = 3; print(a); print(ClassA)
$ class ClassA(): pass; a = 3; print(a); print(ClassA)
$ python class_play.py
3
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "class_play.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    class ClassA(): pass; a = 3; print(a); print(ClassA)
  File "class_play.py", line 1, in ClassA
    class ClassA(): pass; a = 3; print(a); print(ClassA)
NameError: name 'ClassA' is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>but using the class in a new line works:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat class_play.py
class ClassA(): pass; a = 3; print(a);
print(ClassA)
$ python class_play.py
3
&lt;class '__main__.ClassA'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Use newlines, the command line is not limited to a single line:</p>
<pre><code>python -c "
class Foo:
    pass
print(Foo())
"
</code></pre>
<p>or just insert <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3005963/how-can-i-have-a-newline-in-a-string-in-sh"><code>\n</code> sequences in a <code>$'...'</code> string</a></p>
<pre><code>python -c $'class Foo:\n    pass\nprint(Foo())'
</code></pre>
<p>Using semi-colons, you can only add more <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html" rel="noreferrer">simple statements</a>, and they all fall within the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html" rel="noreferrer">same compound statement</a> if you started the line with one. You can't use these to define methods or expect a <code>class</code> statement to have completed, you are <em>still in the <code>class</code> definition</em>.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">why do you want to pass complex programs as a single line?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you need a class, you should probably pull things out into a script instead of using <code>-c</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If it's all on a single line how does the interpreter know that <code>print(ClassA)</code> is not still part of the class definition?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@0x5453 I agree, but I wanted to quickly test some things</span>
<span class="comment-copy">@TBurgis good point :)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">perfect thanks! I missed the fact that I was still in the class definition :)</span>
