<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a function that takes 3 parameters (upperBound, lowerBound, value), if value is not in between upperBound and lowerBound it should get reassigned in between. I can do it for positive numbers but I don't know how it would work for negatives and positives mixed i.e. if </p>
<p>I have f(60, 0, -5) i want the function to display 55. I know we have to use the modulo operator and I can use combinations of different cases but I'd like to achieve the following with just 2 cases :</p>
<p>if value is &lt; lowerBound , then one general statement for positive, negative integers that gives value between bounds</p>
<p>else if value &gt; upperBound , then one general statement for positive, negative integers that gives value between bounds</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>

<p>In Python <code>-5 % 60 = 55</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The % (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second. The numeric arguments are first converted to a common type. A zero right argument raises the ZeroDivisionError exception. The arguments may be floating point numbers, e.g., 3.14%0.7 equals 0.34 (since 3.14 equals 4*0.7 + 0.34.) <strong>The modulo operator always yields a result with the same sign as its second operand</strong> (or zero); the absolute value of the result is strictly smaller than the absolute value of the second operand [1].</p>

<p>remember to do an offset for min value.<br/>
assuming we have the following</p>
<pre><code>int min = 15;
int max = 60;
int testValue = -5;
</code></pre>
<p>do the following</p>
<pre><code>int result = (testValue % (max-min)) + min;
</code></pre>
<p>this should work the same even if min, max or testValue is negative.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Can you please be a little more detailed. I.E if value is &lt; lowerBound, then one general statement such as?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">So basically when value is not in between bounds, it is either less than lower or greater than upper. Suppose it is greater than upper, then I want a statement that would perform some action on my value and set it in between the bounds, i.e. if my upper bound is 60, lower is 0, and value is 65 I would do 65 % 60 to set it. However, if my upper bound is -10 , lower is -20, and my value is -5, I would like that statement to give me -5, so loop around from the back.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">One thing that should be noted is that modulus in python returns the actual modulus (always positive), in java it returns the remainder (which can be negative) so which programming language are you intended to use.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">As in upper = -10, lower = -20, value = -5 -&gt; result = -25 % -20 -&gt; (lower + value) % upper</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No idea in python but yeah that is all it is in Java. else if(//blah) {System.out.println(lower + value) % upper}</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This answer doesn't really answer the question. What if the lower band isn't 0?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">In that case you can simply return zero</span>
