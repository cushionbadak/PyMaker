<p>Hello, I'm Anant Narayan. I'm 10 years old. I want to upgrade the
  default Python3 which is Python 3.5.3 to Python 3.7.2. When googled I found many sites telling how to install latest
  python 3.5 and other versions including python 3.7.0 but none of these
  sites were telling how to upgrade from python 3.5.3 to python 3.7.2
  .So I tried to install Python 3.7.2 instead of upgrading the default
  Python 3.5.3. After some searches I got a guide on How to install Python 3.7 on Raspberry Pi.Here is the link to the website: <a href="https://www.ramoonus.nl/2018/06/30/installing-python-3-7-on-raspberry-pi/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.ramoonus.nl/2018/06/30/installing-python-3-7-on-raspberry-pi/</a> . So I followed the steps and successfully installed Python 3.7.0 on my Raspberry Pi 3 and set the alias of python and python3 to python3.7.0 and now when I enter <code>python --version</code> or <code>python3 --version</code> it gives me 3.7.0. But now I have another problem that is when I shutdown or reboot my Pi and switches it back on and I type <code>python --version</code> it gives me 2.7.13 and  <code>python3</code> it gives me 3.5.3. So please help me with this matter. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Great that you are having fun with your PI! I hope I can help you, please leave a comment if you have more questions.</p>
<p>In Linux, an <code>alias</code> is a setting in your shell, the program that you talk with to control your PI. But as soon as you leave your PI, the shell program is closed and the <code>alias</code> setting is thrown away.</p>
<p>To make the change permanent, you can either add the <code>alias</code> setting to the startup file of your shell (the file <code>.profile</code> in your home directory), or better, change the links.</p>
<p>To change <code>.profile</code>, type the following <strong>exactly</strong> (better to use copy-paste):</p>
<pre><code>echo "alias python3=/usr/local/bin/python3.7"  &gt;&gt; ~/.profile
</code></pre>
<p>The file <code>.profile</code> is read during login, so to activate the change you must log out and log in again.</p>
<p>In Unix, a link is a file that points to another file. <code>/usr/bin/python</code> normally points to <code>/usr/bin/python2.7</code>, and <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> points to <code>/usr/bin/python3.5.3</code>. You can see links by adding the <code>-l</code> (<code>l</code> for long) option to <code>ls</code>, for example <code>ls -l /usr/bin/python*</code>. Links have permissions set to <code>lrwxrwxrwx</code>.</p>
<p>I would leave the <code>/usr/bin/python</code> link alone, this is used by the operating system and that expects certain libraries to be installed that are probably not installed in your new python.</p>
<p>If your new python is <code>/usr/local/opt/python-3.7.2/bin/python3.7</code>, you can change the <code>python3</code> link by typing the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo rm /usr/bin/python3
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3.7 /usr/bin/python3
</code></pre>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<pre><code>    wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.2/Python-3.7.2.tgz

    tar xzvf Python-3.7.2.tgz

    cd Python-3.7.2/

   ./configure

   make -j4

   sudo make install
</code></pre>
<p>After that simply do:</p>
<pre><code>echo "alias python3=’/usr/local/opt/python-3.7.2/bin/python3.7′"  &gt;&gt; ~/.profile
</code></pre>
<p>Hope this work</p>

<span class="comment-copy">does python3.7 still exist on your system after a reboot, under <code>/usr/local/opt/</code> as per the ref link?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yes the folder is still there after reboot.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">just adding an alias would work at this step, similar to what @Deep has mentioned in his answer</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried to install python 3.7.2 with Deep's instructions and copy-pasted the line in the .profile, logged out and logged in again and when I type python3, it gives me the following error : -bash: /usr/bin/python3: No such file or directory .   I would like to know if there is a setup wizard for installing  Python 3.7.2 on Linux just like the setup wizard for installing Python on Windows. Thanks.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Wizards? Nah, this situation is not covered by wizards. Wizards only help with situations they foresaw. You are almost done, only the alias in the .profile points to the wrong file. My bad, probably. I'll install P3.7.2 on my own Pi, see where the python3.7 file lives.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Anant, by following the instructions of Deep I got a Python that lives in /usr/local/bin/python3.7, I edited my instructions accordingly. You can test whether this is the same for you by simply running <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.7</code>. If that gets you into python3.7.2, you're OK to just repeat the instructions. The extra line in .profile does not matter. You might want to open the file in e.g. <code>gedit</code> and remove it for extra thoroughness points ;-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you Evert,  I followed instructions given by you and now my default Python 3 is Python 3.7.2 .                                                                          Thanks Everyone.Special thanks to Evert:-)</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My Pleasure, Anant! I hope you will get just as hooked to programming as me 40 years ago ;-) It is a great way to make a living!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Do <code>make altinstall</code>, otherwise you will overwrite the system Python, which you almost <i>never</i> want to do.  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#building-python" rel="nofollow noreferrer">docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#building-python</a></span>
