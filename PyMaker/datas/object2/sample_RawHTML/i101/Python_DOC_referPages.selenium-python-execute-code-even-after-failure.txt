<p>I am using python unittest and trying to catch the exceptions. I have tried with self.fail but in that case, once there is an exception, it is a failure and it stops running the rest of the code</p>
<p>What can I try so even if one case fails, it still executes the rest of the cases ?</p>
<p>I am trying to avoid printing the exceeptions.</p>
<p>Code currently using:</p>
<pre><code>if 'Anonymous' in elem_welcome.text:
    pass
else:
    self.fail('Test Failed: Logout Failed'))
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>Use the try and except block and name the said 'error' on the except block
E.g. Error is 'NameError'</p>
<pre><code>try:
  #cases
except NameError:
  #other cases
</code></pre>
<p>You can read more here <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Handling Exceptions</a></p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>You can make every test to be a function and call it from the main block. This way each one will get executed and the failed once will return the fail reason to be filed by main block.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">thank you but there are quite a few cases and a number of exception that is possible in each node so following try and except on each one would create a number of levels which I am trying to avoid. any other idea ?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I suggest you provide your code so we/others can come up with a solution specifically for your problem. This would also prevent some random solution that could confuse you. Thanks! :-)</span>
