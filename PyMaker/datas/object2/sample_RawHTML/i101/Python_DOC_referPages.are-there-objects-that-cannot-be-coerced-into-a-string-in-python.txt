<p>In Python, can any object be coerced into a string unless its <code>__str__</code> method is overloaded to raise an exception?</p>

<p>The type object has a method for string coercion as youâ€™ve noted. If some object did not have this method defined, it would not be an object. This contradicts the first statement. QED. </p>

<p>Yes, any Python object can be converted to a <code>str</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some operations are supported by several object types; in particular, practically all objects can be compared, tested for truth value, and converted to a string (with the <code>repr()</code> function or the slightly different <code>str()</code> function). The latter function is implicitly used when an object is written by the <code>print()</code> function.</p>
