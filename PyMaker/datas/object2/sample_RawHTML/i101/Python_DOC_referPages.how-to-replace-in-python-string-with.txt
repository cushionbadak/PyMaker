<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I'm trying to parse through text scraped from reddit and clean it up for nlp, but the text has backslashes before each single quote. When I try to use string.replace, however there seems to be no effect, with \' staying the same</p>
<pre><code>print(submission.selftext.replace('\n','').replace('\\\'','\''))
</code></pre>
<p>to be clear, there is no issue with replace itself, it removes the end-lines just fine. How do I make replace recognize these characters?</p>

<p>If you're fine with using regex you can try this -</p>
<pre><code>import re
a = "123123\\'\\'213\\'as"
a = re.sub(r'\\(?=\')', '', a)
</code></pre>
<p>gives <code>123132''213'as</code></p>
<p>Given that you want to only replace the backslashes that are followed by single quotation marks and not all of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>you can write <code>chr(92)</code> to substitute <code>\</code></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(chr(92))
\                
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Return the string representing a character whose Unicode code point is
  the integer i. For example, chr(97) returns the string 'a', while
  chr(8364) returns the string 'â‚¬'. This is the inverse of ord().</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Using double quotes also makes it easier when dealing with single quotes in strings: print("\\\'".replace("\\'","'")) does actually remove the \</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I've tried this, to no effect. even trying to replace all backslashes .replace(chr(92),'') doesn't seem to make any difference</span>
