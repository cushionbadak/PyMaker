<p>I have a lots of programs in different languages, but all of them do the same thing. If I give the same input to them, they all give the same output.</p>
<p>I want to process the output of each program, so I need output of each program in a string variable.</p>
<p>I want to write code in python to test these programs, in Ubuntu's terminal. I want to to work like the test code on the ACM servers. </p>
<p>How can I write/read in the Ubuntu terminal with python?</p>

<p>Getting an actual terminal <em>window</em> open that the user can see, and typing in it, would require some fiddly interaction with X11, which manages the desktop on Ubuntu.</p>
<p>But if all you want to do is to have your Python code run commands and look at their output, without necessarily having a real window, you probably want the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/subprocess.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subprocess module</a>. In current versions of Python 3, you can pass <code>capture_output=True</code> to <code>subprocess.Run()</code> along with your command, and then look at the output of the command (in <code>.stdout</code> under the returned <code>CompletedProcess</code>) to see if it looks like what you wanted it to look like.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">Usually, we write to the terminal in Python using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print</code> function</a>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">are you kidding?? i want to write commands in terminal like  cd ,cp, man .....</span>
<span class="comment-copy">No, I wasn't kidding, I was trying to understand your question. Sorry!</span>
<span class="comment-copy">actually  I want to process outputs but this method just print outputs I need output in string var</span>
<span class="comment-copy">If you pass <code>capture_output=True</code>, the output should be captured into a variable. Try something like <code>var = subprocess.run(["ls", "-l", "/dev/null"], capture_output=True).stdout</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">and one another question is it good way to write Judge for challenges??</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I wouldn't advise using this method to write a judging program unless you trust all challenge participants. You're directly running their code, which could do all sorts of things, including deleting the judge.</span>
