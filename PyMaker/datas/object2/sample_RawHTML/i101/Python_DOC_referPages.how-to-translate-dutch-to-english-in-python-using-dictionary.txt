<p>I am trying to translate I am Jason using this code, but when I use it, it prints out nothing, unless I do one word like hello, then it prints out guten tag, but that's it. Plus, I can't turn the input data into lowercase to be able to compare it to the dictionary. What can I do to make this code work?</p>
<pre><code>name = input("Please enter your name\n")
data = [input("Please enter sentence\n")]
data = data.lower() #to make sentence lowercase to be able to compare it to the words in the dictionary
dictionary = {"hello": "hallo", "i" : "ik", "am" : "ben"}

dictionary[name] = name
for word in data:
    if word in dictionary:
        print (dictionary[word],)

<span class="comment-copy">Does your code produce an Exception? When asking about code that produces an Exception always include the complete Traceback - copy and paste it as text then format it as code.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I included the traceback in my edit</span>
<span class="comment-copy"><code>data = [d.lower() for d in data]</code></span>
<span class="comment-copy">Thank you, that removed the traceback, but it still doesn't output a sentence or anything at all and just ends the program when I write more than two words, even if they're included in the dictionary</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Python tells you what is wrong: <code>AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'lower'</code> at line 3. So, <code>data</code> has no function lower() you can apply it to ! Because <code>data</code>is of type <code>[]</code>, not <code>str</code>.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">I tried the data.split() and it says                                                                                   data = data.split() AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'split'</span>
