<p>Hello I would like to use</p>
<pre><code>print('Hello world')
</code></pre>
<p>to see what's going on with some variables, however im using Docker which means by default it's not printing anything.
Can someone tell me how I can pass these print commands to the docker container ?</p>
</div>

<p>This is because Python buffers its output by default.</p>
<p>An easy way to change this behavior is to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONUNBUFFERED" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1</code> environment variable</a>: <code>docker run -e PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 &lt;your_image&gt;</code></p>
<p>An other way is to call the python command with the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#cmdoption-u" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>-u</code> option</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe you should run your container with the privileged option to share /dev (therefore, sharing /dev/stdout).</p>
<p>This is working for me:</p>
<p>print.py:</p>
<pre><code>print("Hello world")
</code></pre>
<p>Dockerfile:</p>
<pre><code>FROM python
ADD print.py /
ENTRYPOINT ["python",  "/print.py"]
</code></pre>
<p>Commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker build -t python-test .
$ docker run -it --privileged python-test
Hello world
</code></pre>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<span class="comment-copy">You can check <code>docker logs</code> to see output of the containers</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Okay thanks I'll look into it</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Additionally, you could run the container in non-detached mode, i.e omit the <code>-d</code> flag when doing <code>docker run</code> and output should be printed to stdout</span>
<span class="comment-copy">This did the trick, thanks :D</span>
<span class="comment-copy">A simple <code>print</code> statement does not need the vast power over the host that <code>--privileged</code> gives (for example it gives the power to shut down the host).  <code>/dev/stdout</code> is usually just a link to <code>/proc/self/fd/1</code>, which is to say, it's the process's normal standard output; you don't even need a device file to write there.</span>
