<p>What i'm trying to learn is how to allow a user to create a list of names then attach a number to each of the names for the user to look up afterwards. I'm not even sure if Database is the right term for this.</p>
<p>I'm able to allow the user to create a list of numbers, but I dont know how to, let the user make a list of names, and attach the two so the user can just look up a name and find their score after they create the lists.</p>
<pre><code>list_of_nums = []
loop = True
while loop == True:
    try: num = int(input("Enter Integer, 0 to end: "))
    except ValueError: num = "invalid"
    if num == "invalid": print("\nPlease Print A Valid Integer!\n");
    elif num != 0: list_of_nums.append(num)
    else: loop = False
print(list_of_nums)

<p>you should start by studying pickle: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html</a></p>
<p>Once you get the general idea, master the use of sqlite. <a href="https://sqlite.org/cli.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The raw sqlite please</a>, in order to get yourself exposed to the SQL language. This is not ansi sql but is popular and close enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Then use some query builder</a> to help you to get able to master <a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">your</a> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/MySQL-python/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">next</a> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cx-Oracle/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">data</a><a href="https://pypi.org/project/pymssql/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ba</a><a href="https://pypi.org/project/ibm-db/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">se</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding your problem with numbers, names and scores, try either to use the same loop to ask all the needed information or use more loops.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that you're learning python, so you could take the codecademy.com python course. It could save you from a lot of trouble.</p>

<p>If you only want to save temporary this inputs in the list you should do this:</p>
<pre><code>list_of_nums = []

num = 1

while num:
    try:
        num = int(input("Enter a integer, 0 to end: "))
    except:
        print("Enter a integer number")
    list_of_nums.append(num)

print(list_of_nums)
</code></pre>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>But if you want to pair values, its better to use dictionaries:</p>
<pre><code>grades = {}

num = 1

while True:
    try:
        name = input("Name: ")
        num = int(input("Grade, -1 to end: ")) # the person can also take 0!
    except:
        print("ENTER A INTEGER NUMBER!")
        continue

    if num == -1:
        break # break the loop

    # if &lt;num&gt; isn't between 0 and 10:
    if num &lt; 0 or num &gt; 10: # or the minimum and max values you want
        print("ENTER A GRADE BETWEEN 0 AND 10!")
        continue

    grades[name] = num # You can acess &lt;num&gt; with grades[name]


#SHOW THE GRADES IN ALPHABETIC ORDER
grades_in_order = []
#thats how you iterate a dictionary
#you get the keys with a for, and access that key like a list index
for name in grades:
    grades_in_order.append(name)

grades_in_order.sort()

print("\n\nGrades:")

for name in grades_in_order:
    print(name, grades[name], sep='\t') # the sep is optional
</code></pre>
<p>Here is run example:</p>
<pre><code>Name: Iago
Grade, -1 to end: Invalid
ENTER A INTEGER NUMBER!
Name: Hano
Grade, -1 to end: 11
ENTER A GRADE BETWEEN 0 AND 10!
Name: Iago
Grade, -1 to end: -2
ENTER A GRADE BETWEEN 0 AND 10!
Name: Hano
Grade, -1 to end: 10
Name: Iago
Grade, -1 to end: 10
Name: Nick
Grade, -1 to end: 0
Name: Mary
Grade, -1 to end: 9
Name: Jane
Grade, -1 to end: 7
Name: DOESNT MATTER
Grade, -1 to end: -1


Grades:
Hano    10
Iago    10
Jane    7
Mary    9
Nick    0

<span class="comment-copy">Database isn't the correct term for this, because all the data will be lost when your program terminates.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">On another note, this isn't Java.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Should this be retagged python?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Yeah my bad, I meant python</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Sounds like you want a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries" rel="nofollow noreferrer">dict</a>. This will make an association between the names and the numbers. I don't recommend you try to learn about fundamentals of the language piecemeal from us. Read a dedicated book or tutorial.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">ok thank you, but how do I then, have a list where you add names and pair them with the grades?</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Check the edit!</span>
