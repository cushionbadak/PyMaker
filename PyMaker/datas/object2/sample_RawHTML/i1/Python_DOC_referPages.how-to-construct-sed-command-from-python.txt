<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>I have a string that contains quotes like this:</p>
<pre><code>string = "\"This is my mom's vase\", said Kevin."
</code></pre>
<p>Problem is when I use it as a string in python it adds a backslash before single quotes, as seen here:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; string
'"This is my mom\'s vase", said Kevin.'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Why is this happening and what can I do about it?</p>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>It's just escaped in the repl. If you print it out, it will show there is no slash added:</p>
<pre><code>print(string)
# output: "This is my mom's vase", said Kevin.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<h2>The Explanation</h2>
<p>What you're seeing is the representation of your string as produced by the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>repr</code></a> function. <code>repr</code> outputs strings in such a way that they're valid python literals; in other words, you can copy/paste the output of <code>repr(string)</code> into a python program without getting a syntax error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; string
'"This is my mom\'s vase", said Kevin.'
&gt;&gt;&gt; '"This is my mom\'s vase", said Kevin.'  # it's valid python code!
'"This is my mom\'s vase", said Kevin.'
</code></pre>
<p>Because your string contains both single quotes <code>'</code> and double quotes <code>"</code>, python has to escape one of those quotes in order to produce a valid string literal. The same way you escaped your double quotes with backslashes:</p>
<pre><code>"\"This is my mom's vase\", said Kevin."
</code></pre>
<p>Python instead chooses to escape the single quotes:</p>
<pre><code>'"This is my mom\'s vase", said Kevin.'
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, both of these strings are completely identical. Those backslashes are only there for escaping purposes, they don't actually exist in the string. You can confirm this by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>print</code></a>ing the string, which outputs the string's real value:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(string)
"This is my mom's vase", said Kevin.
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">And "the repl" just means "the command-line where you try things out".  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop</a></span>
<span class="comment-copy">And they are escaped because in the command line strings are enclosed with single quotes</span>
