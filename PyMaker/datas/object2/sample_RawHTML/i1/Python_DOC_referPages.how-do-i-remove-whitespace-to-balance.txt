<p>I just started Python as my first language two and a half weeks ago so please bear in mind that I probably took the longest route to create this code. That in mind, any advice you have for the rest of the code is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Anyways, on to my question: I'm trying to get everything to line up nicely regardless of the item_name the user enters. Of course, the longer a name the user enters, the farther it pushes the rest of the line. Does anyone have any advice to remove a certain amount of whitespace depending on the length of item_name? I've never posted code like this before so I might not do it right, but here's the specific print section for what I'm having issues with:</p>
<pre><code>for i in range(0, loop_num):
print('Item %d: %s               $%.2f    %d     $%.2f' % (
     item_counter , 
     item_name_list[i] , 
     item_price_list[i] , 
     int(item_quantity_list[i]) , 
     single_item_total[i] 
     ))
item_counter += 1
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the first half of the code before the above: </p>
<pre><code>    item_name_list = []
item_price_list = []
item_quantity_list = []
single_item_total = []
loop_num = int(input('Enter how many different unique items you have total \n'))
item_counter = 1

for i in range(0, loop_num):
    item_name = input('Please enter the name of item %d: ' % item_counter)
    item_name_list.append(item_name)
    item_price = float(input('Please enter the price of item %d: ' % item_counter))
    item_price_list.append(item_price)
    item_quantity = float(input('Please enter the quantity of item %d: ' % item_counter))
    item_quantity_list.append(item_quantity)
    item_counter += 1
</code></pre>
<p>I won't give the final section because that's simply me printing the subtotal, tax, and grand total. Here's the output when I enter 3 items with same number of characters in the name:</p>
<pre>
RECEIPT                                                                                                                                              

        Name               Price Quantity Total                                                                                                     
Item 1: Milk               $3.99    1     $3.99  
Item 2: Eggs               $2.00    4     $8.00                                                                                                      
Item 3: Soda               $4.00    3     $12.00                                                                                                     

Subtotal    $23.99                                                                                                                                   
Sales tax   $1.20                                                                                                                                    
Grand Total $25.19 
</pre>
<p>If I enter any character different from the others, the prices and quantities get pushed around. If it's too complicated to do, just tell me. I just hate having them not be able to line up.    </p>

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<p>The <code>format()</code> function and its <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">format string syntax</a> are a better way to format strings than the old <code>%</code> formatting.</p>
<p>In this case the align characters <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> can help and the output code becomes something like:</p>
<pre><code>print('Item {}: {:&lt;15} ${:.2f} {:&gt;4}     ${:.2f}'.format(...)
</code></pre>

<span class="comment-copy">You should read about the <code>format()</code> function(s). It is meant to replace the <code>%</code> formatting and provides helpful features.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">My university course taught me to use %s %d etc. I'm assuming that's outdated but I still see some people use it. Is this specifically why you told me to look at it?                                                                                                         &lt;   :  left-align text in the field ^   :  center text in the field &gt;   :  right-align text in the field</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Right, this makes things much easier.</span>
<span class="comment-copy">Nevermind, I see why the further I got down on the page that explains them. Most of it looked so similar to what % did that I was wondering what the point was. Thank you so much for telling me this! Saved me a huge headache.</span>
